The\\nsample−detector distance was 166.9 mm, enabling collection of data in\\nthe scattering vector (q) range of 0.45−5.00 Å−1, where q =( 4π sin\\nθ)/λ, λ is the X-ray wavelength, andθ is the Bragg angle. The 2D\\ndiﬀraction data was reduced to 1D and converted to 2θ° using the\\nGSAS2 software for better comparability.39 In this work, structural\\ndevelopments are depicted for theﬁrst discharge (Figures 3 − 8).

To compare the eﬀect of two\\nimprovement strategies for metal oxide cathodes, speciﬁcally Co-\\ndoping and morphology optimization, four representatives of the\\nprominent material class of layered NaxMO2 (M = transition metal)\\nhave been studied: hexagonal ﬂakes and hollow spheres of P2−\\nNaxMnO2 and P2−NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2. The better electrochemical\\nperformance of the spheres over theﬂakes and of the Co-doped over\\nthe undoped materials are explained on the basis of structural\\nfeatures revealed byoperando synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction. The\\nhigher cycling stability of the material doped with ∼10% Co is\\nattributed to three eﬀects: (i) the suppression of a Jahn−Teller-\\ninduced structural transition from the initial hexagonal to an\\northorhombic phase that is observed in NaxMnO2; (ii) suppression of ordering processes of Na+; and (iii) enhanced Na+ kinetics\\nas revealed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique measurements andin situelectrochemical impedance measurements.\\nIncreased capacity and cycling stability of spheres overﬂakes may be related to smaller changes of the unit cell volume of spheres\\nand thus to reduced structural stress. Co-doped spheres combine the advantages of both strategies and exhibit the best cycling\\nstability.\\n■ INTRODUCTION\\nSodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have received signiﬁcant attention\\nrecently and are considered a viable alternative to the\\nubiquitous lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1−5 NIBs have a cost\\nadvantage over LIBs for two main reasons. Na, unlike Li, does\\nnot alloy with Al in the anodic potential region. Thus, Cu,\\nwhich is used as the anodic current collector in LIBs, can be\\nreplaced with the cheaper Al for NIBs.6−8 Second, Na resources\\nare more widespread and abundant than Li-based raw\\nmaterials.1,9 One of the most promising classes of cathode\\nmaterials is layered oxides, Na xMO2 (M = transition\\nmetal).10,11 Within this class, there are several dominant\\nsubgroups, which are deﬁned on the basis of the coordination\\nof the Na-ions between the transition metal−oxygen layers.\\nFollowing the nomenclature introduced by Delmas et al.,12 in\\nO-type materials, Na+ is coordinated by oxygen octahedrally,\\nwhereas in P-type materials, the coordination is prismatic.\\nDiﬀerences in stacking, i.e., shifts of the layers composed of\\nedge-sharing MO6-octahedra against one another, are indicated\\nby numbers. In a P2-structure, e.g., two layers of MO 6-\\noctahedra need to be depicted in the unit cell to accurately\\ndescribe the structure. Theﬁrst studies on insertion processes\\ninto these layered oxides have been conducted in the\\n1980s.12−17 Recently, particularly P 2-type materials have\\nreceived considerable interest because of their good com-\\npromise regarding cycling stability and capacity.18−26 In these\\nReceived: November 23, 2015\\nRevised: March 14, 2016\\nPublished: March 15, 2016\\nArticle\\npubs.acs.org/cm'),\n",

The variety in terms of\\ncomposition is immense and is the result of attempts toﬁne-\\ntune certain characteristics such as cycling stability, operating\\npotential, capacity, or cost. Thus, understanding the eﬀect of\\nthose diﬀerent transition metals is key to further develop and\\noptimize P2-type layered oxides as cathodes for NIBs. Ni, for\\nexample, is employed due to its high redox potential, which\\nelevates the average discharge potential, and thus energy\\ndensity, of the material.11,24,27 Co in Mn/Co-based layered\\noxides is an interesting substitution option as Co improves\\ncyclability.28−30 Interestingly, Co is reduced and oxidized in\\nparallel to Mn over the course of cycling.31 Increased cycling\\nstability was also obtained by incorporating Fe.8,11 Fe-doping\\nsuppresses minor structural transitions during cycling and\\nconcomitant Na+ ordering processes and thus increases capacity\\nretention. Mg both stabilizes the structure by suppressing a\\nstructural distortion toward an orthorhombic phase and leads\\nto a smoothening of the charge/discharge curves. However, this\\nis achieved at the expense of capacity. Several combinations of\\nthe aforementioned (transition) metals have been reported in\\nattempts to combine the respective advantages.20,32,33 In this\\nreport, we focus on better understanding two improvement\\nstrategies on the basic P2 −NaxMnO2+z structure, namely,\\nsubstitution of manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% and\\nmorphology optimization. It was shown by our group before\\nthat substituting 11% of Mn with Co in the P2-NaxMnO2+z\\nstructure suppresses Na+ ordering and leads to an increase of\\ncycling stability.29 The underlying structural causes are the\\nfocus of this publication.\\nAnother in ﬂuencing factor for NIB performance is the\\nsynthetic route.

We found previously that hollow spheres achieve higher\\ncapacity and a better cycling performance thanﬂakes due to less\\nsevere morphological degradation over cycling. 35 This\\nprompted us to look into the structural aspects of this\\ndiﬀerence. In this work, the e ﬀect of Co-doping and\\nmorphology optimization are investigated using operando\\nsynchrotron X-ray diﬀraction (XRD), as well as galvanostatic\\nintermittent titration technique (GITT) and in situ electro-\\nchemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Manganese dissolu-\\ntion was shown to have a negligible eﬀect on capacity fading\\nusing various analytical techniques. It is shown that for P2-\\nNaxMnO2+z ﬂakes a two phase region evolves during discharge.\\nSubstituting 10% of the Mn with Co suppresses both Na+\\nordering processes and the transition of the initial hexagonal to\\nan orthorhombic phase. These eﬀects are identiﬁed as possible\\ncauses for improved cycling performance. Moreover, it is shown\\nthat the enhanced conductivity adds to the positive inﬂuence of\\na minor substitution of Mn with Co. Enhanced cycling\\nperformance of the spherical over theﬂake-like morphology\\nis attributed to smaller changes of the volume of the unit cell\\nduring cycling for the spheres. Finally, both approaches were\\ncombined in the synthesis of spherical P2-\\nNa0.6Co0.1Mn0.9MnO2, which shows a signiﬁcant improvement\\nin cycling stability. Thus, the advantage of a variation of a\\npreviously investigated optimization strategy, doping, and a\\nnovel promising approach, spherical morphologies, were\\ndemonstrated.\\n■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\\nSynthesis and Coin Cell Preparation.NaxMnO2+z (NMO) and\\nNaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2+z (NCO) ﬂakes were synthesized by combustion\\nsynthesis as described previously. 29,36−38 NaNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich,\\n≥99%) and Mn(CH 3COO)2 (Alfa Aesar, anhydrous, 98%) were\\nmixed (molar ratio Na:Mn = 0.7) and subsequently dissolved in\\ndeionized water.

The diﬀerence in the lattice parameters of the\\ninitial NMO and NCO can be explained by a contraction of the\\nlattice induced by cobalt.28 For NMO spheres the diﬀerences in\\nthe lattice as compared to NMOﬂakes is due to an initially\\nhigher Na+ content of the spheres. The diﬀerence of the lattice\\nparameters between NCO ﬂakes and NCO spheres is\\nnegligible. The (hkl) re ﬂections of the hollow spheres are\\nbroader than theﬂakes’, as can be seen exemplarily for the most\\nintense re ﬂection (002), which has a full width at half-\\nmaximum (FWHM) of 2θ° = 0.30 for the NMO spheres and\\n0.12° for the NMO ﬂakes. Paulsen et al.28 indicated that the\\nemployed short annealing time can lead to stacking faults or\\ninhomogeneities of the Na+ distribution, which would explain\\nthe breadth of the reﬂections of the spheres. In addition, the\\nﬂakes had crystallographic texture and, thus, a thorough\\nRietveld reﬁnement for the operando data is challenging and\\nbeyond the scope of this publication. Phases were identiﬁed\\nusing the Pawley approach toﬁt the whole pattern; for powder\\nmaterial of both NMO and NCOﬂakes a Rietveld reﬁnement\\nwas employed (International Crystal Structure Database, ICSD-\\n50301). For a comparison of the diﬀerences in crystallite size\\nbetween ﬂakes and spheres the Debye−Scherrer method was\\napplied to both Co-doped versions as they are more crystalline\\nthan the undoped analogues. According to the Debye−Scherrer\\nanalysis, the NCO ﬂakes have an average crystallite size of\\n605 nm whereas for the NCO spheres the respective size is 345\\nnm. As can be seen inFigure 1 the size of theﬂakes is on the\\norder of micrometers. However, considering the limitations of\\nthe Debye−Scherrer equation (e.g., value of the shape factor),\\nit cannot be excluded that theﬂakes are single crystals. The\\nﬂakes’ diameter and thickness vary (Figure 1a). The hollow\\nspheres have an outer diameter of approximately 5μm, and\\ntheir outer shells are built up of hexagonal layered ﬂakes\\n(Figure 1b). The shell thickness is comparable to the thickness\\nof the synthesizedﬂakes.\\nElectrochemical Studies.For the galvanostatic cycle tests\\nat 20 mA g−1 the cells wereﬁrst charged to 3.8 V, followed by a\\ndischarge which is displayed inFigure 2a.

The observed fading prompted\\nus to investigate Mn2+ dissolution from the active materials\\nfollowing a potential disproportionation of Mn3+ into Mn2+ and\\nMn4+.30,43,44 Calculations on the hypothetical amount of\\nmanganese in the electrolyte, assuming that capacity fading is\\nonly due to manganese dissolution, show that the respective\\nvalues (∼10−20 ppm) are signiﬁcantly above the detection\\nlimits for ICP, AAS, and EDS. However, neither ICP, nor AAS,\\nnor EDS measurements of the processed and concentrated\\nelectrolyte were able to detect dissolved manganese. The Mn\\ndetection limit for these methods is ∼1 ppm, so that the\\namount of dissolved Mn (if any) is <1 ppm. Consequently, a\\ncapacity fading of≥1% should be detectable by these methods\\nif it were resulting from Mn dissolution. Thus, it can be\\nconcluded that manganese dissolution has a negligible eﬀect on\\ncapacity fading of the P2-type materials presented in this work\\nand cannot explain the diﬀerences between the respective\\nmaterials.\\nStructural Studies.In the following sections, the structural\\nprocesses as a further cause of the diﬀerent cycling perform-\\nances are investigated.\\nNMO Flakes. During discharge (3.8 V −1.5 V), the Na +\\ncontent (x) increased from 0.46 to 0.98. The (002) reﬂection\\nshifts to a higher angle, reﬂecting a contraction of the unit cell\\nalong the c-lattice parameter ( Figure 3 a). As Na + inserts\\nbetween the MnO6 layers, the negative charges of the oxygen\\nbetween diﬀerent layers are screened, which moves the layers\\ncloser together. The shift of the (010) reﬂection to lower angles\\nreﬂects an expansion of the unit cell along the a- and b-\\ndirections (Figure 3b). The cause of this is a decrease of the\\noxidation state of manganese during discharge, which results in\\nan expansion of the MnO 6-octahedra and, therefore, an\\nexpansion of thea- and b-lattice parameters.18,22 Two diﬀerent\\nphases can be observed during discharge. Initially, the\\nhexagonal P2-type phase of the pristine material is maintained\\nup to a Na+ loading of ∼0.87. Then, new reﬂections occur in\\nthe pattern (at 2θ° = 21.3, 23.6, 26.2, 29.6, 37.8, 38.9, 43.1,\\n45.0; see Figure 4; minor impurity from hydrated phase45,46)\\nand become more intense until the end of the discharge at 1.5\\nV.

This suggests that substituting manganese with\\ncobalt on the order of 10% has a stabilizing eﬀect. Moreover, as\\nshown in the Electrochemical Studies , Co suppresses Na +\\nordering processes in the structure, which otherwise occur for\\nthe undoped material. These two eﬀects eliminate structural\\nheterogeneity that inherently occurs as the result of repeated\\nstructural transformations. The suppression of these phase\\ntransitions is suggested to be the reason for the enhanced\\ncycling stability of the NCOﬂakes over the NMOﬂakes.\\nNCO Spheres.In order to examine whether morphology has\\nan inﬂuence on these transitions, spherical NCO, for which no\\nphase transition is anticipated due to the suppression of\\ntransitions by Co-doping, is discussed here. During discharge\\nfrom 3.8−1.5 V, Na+ content was increased over a wider range:\\nfrom 0.43 to 1.05. As can be seen inFigure 7, similar to NCO\\nﬂakes, no phase change occurs. Thus, the diﬀerence in cycling\\nstability between the ﬂakes and spheres cannot be the\\nconsequence of phase transitions. While the change of thec-\\nlattice parameter is similar to that of the NCOﬂakes, the b-\\nlattice parameter, and therefore also the unit cell volume,\\nchanges less severely (Figure 3). Thus, the stress on the crystal\\nstructure is reduced as compared to theﬂakes and the volume\\nexpansion of the spheres (∼2.3%) while discharging from 3.8−\\n1.5 V is only half the volume change of theﬂakes (∼4.8%). The\\neﬀect on the structure is exacerbated by the anisotropic\\nexpansion of the lattice parameters. As thec-lattice parameter\\ndecreases during Na+ insertion, the expansion of the unit cell\\nvolume is based on an increase of thea- andb-lattice parameter,\\ni.e., an expansion within the plane of MnO6-octahedra. This\\ndiﬀerence might be one contributing factor to the superior\\ncycling stability of spheres overﬂakes and could be the cause of\\nthe diﬀerence in the preservation of morphology over the\\ncourse of cycling described previously.35\\nComparison of Strain Distribution.For undoped materials,\\nthe phase change giving rise to additional overlapping\\nreﬂections makes detailed comparison of the structures diﬃcult.\\nHowever, given there is no phase transition at high Na+ content\\nfor Co-doped materials we can directly compare NCO spheres\\nand NCO ﬂakes. As described above, the volume change is\\ngreater for the ﬂakes. Despite the ability to accommodate a\\nslightly larger amount of Na+ in the structure of the NCO\\nspheres (1.05 Na+ for NCO spheres compared to 1.00 Na+ for\\nNCO ﬂakes), the shift in the (002) reﬂection to higher 2θ°\\nangles for NCO spheres is particularly modest. While one may\\nnot be able to infer much from the contraction along thec-\\ndirection, observable diﬀerences in the FWHM are apparent for\\nthe (002) and (004) reﬂection for the NCO spheres as detailed\\nin Table S3. Here we look at the relative ratio of FWHM(004)/\\nFWHM(002). For the NCOﬂakes, while there is no appreciable\\nchange in the ratio (within the error) when increasing the Na+\\ncontent from 0.6 (OCV) to 1.0, there is a modest observable\\nvariation at a low sodium content of 0.49 Na+ (FWHM(004)/\\nFWHM(002) = 1.18). This possibly indicates a larger distribution\\nof strain in the material. The ratio FWHM(004)/FWHM(002) is\\nlarger for NCO spheres. While it is∼1 around OCV (0.5−0.6\\nNa+), it is >1 when moving away from OCV in either direction,\\ni.e., for Na+ < 0.5 and Na+ > 0.6. This suggests that although\\nthere is a lesser volume change for the spheres, a greater degree\\nof strain distribution in the material is present at high and low\\nNa+ loading, implying possible inhomogeneities in the\\ndistribution of Na + concentration throughout the material.\\nWhile the mechanism by which this takes place is unclear, it is\\npostulated that this ability to accommodate strain rather than\\nrelease it in the form of lattice expansion may have two eﬀects:\\n(i) protect the material from structural fatigue during successive\\ncycling leading to superior cycling stability and (ii) facilitate the'),\n",

The\\noccurrence of the P′2 phase is not as clear as for the NMO\\nﬂakes.

As structural changes\\nresult in diﬀerent pathways along which Na+ can move in the\\nstructure, phase transitions also have an eﬀect on diﬀusion. To\\nelucidate these changes, GITT andin situ EIS were performed.\\nFigure 9 shows the development of the e ﬀective diﬀusion\\ncoeﬃcients for all materials during the course of one discharge\\nas measured by GITT.

This increase is attributed to\\nthe eﬀect of the Co. For NMO spheres (Figure 9c) the trend is\\nsimilar to the NMOﬂakes.

This substantiates the\\nhypothesis of a phase transition from the hexagonalP63/mmc\\nto the orthorhombicCmcm phase discussed in the section on\\nStructural Studies. The minimum which indicates the phase\\ntransition toward an orthorhombic phase for both NMO\\nmaterials can be seen neither for the Co-dopedﬂakes nor\\nspheres. This is in line with suppression of the phase transition\\nas concluded in theStructural Studies section. Over the whole\\nP2 phase region both NCOﬂakes and spheres exhibit higher\\ndiﬀusion coeﬃcients than the undoped analogues. This is\\nexplained by enhancement of the Na+ conductivity as a result of\\nCo-doping. This higher conductivity is also reﬂected in the rate\\ncapability, which is better for the Co-doped materials (Figure\\n2c). The reason for the lower conductivity of the undoped\\nmaterial is attributed to the high resistivity induced by the\\nMn3+, which, in its d4 high-spin conﬁguration, is a Jahn−Teller\\nactive ion and has more localized electrons to interact with the\\npositively charged sodium.52,53 For LiMnO2, doping results in a\\nsuppression of the Jahn −Teller e ﬀect, which lowers the\\ndiﬀusion barrier and thus increases ionic conductivity. 54 A\\nsimilar eﬀect is assumed here. Moreover, the suppression of the\\nNa+ ordering may further facilitate the Na+ transport between\\nthe layers.\\nThese ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by EIS (Table S5 and\\nFigure S5) in a three-electrode setup for NMO and NCOﬂakes\\nat various potentials.

In addition,\\ndissolved manganese could not be detected in the electrolyte\\nfor NMO ﬂakes over the course of cycling and is therefore\\nthought to play a negligible role. P2-NaxMnO2 ﬂakes undergo\\npartial phase transition toward an orthorhombic crystal system\\nupon the insertion of Na+, while Co-doping on the order of\\n10% suppresses these structural transformations. The lack of\\nrepeated phase transitions might reduce inhomogeneity in the\\nstructure and, together with the suppression of Na+ ordering\\nprocesses, explain the better cycling stability of the doped\\nmaterial. In addition to the beneﬁcial structural eﬀects, Co-\\ndoping is also shown to have a positive inﬂuence on Na-ion\\ntransport within the structure. This not only explains the better\\nrate capability of doped vs undoped materials but could also\\ncontribute toward improved cycling stability. Superior cycling\\nstability of hollow spheres as compared toﬂakes is attributed to\\nthe reduced volume expansion and contraction for the spheres.\\nThus, increased strain within the structure of the spheres is one\\nexplanation for this diﬀerence.

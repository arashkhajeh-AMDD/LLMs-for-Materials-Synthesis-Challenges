To compare the effect of two improvement strategies for metal oxide cathodes, specifically Codoping and morphology optimization, four representatives of the prominent material class of layered NaxMO2 (M = transition metal) have been studied: hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres of P2− NaxMnO2 and P2−NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2. The better electrochemical performance of the spheres over the flakes and of the Co-doped over the undoped materials are explained on the basis of structural features revealed by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The higher cycling stability of the material doped with ∼10% Co is attributed to three effects: (i) the suppression of a Jahn−Tellerinduced structural transition from the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombic phase that is observed in NaxMnO2; (ii) suppression of ordering processes of Na+; and (iii) enhanced Na+ kinetics as revealed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique measurements and in situ electrochemical impedance measurements. Increased capacity and cycling stability of spheres over flakes may be related to smaller changes of the unit cell volume of spheres and thus to reduced structural stress. Co-doped spheres combine the advantages of both strategies and exhibit the best cycling stability. ■INTRODUCTION Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have received significant attention recently and are considered a viable alternative to the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1−5 NIBs have a cost advantage over LIBs for two main reasons. Na, unlike Li, does not alloy with Al in the anodic potential region. Thus, Cu, which is used as the anodic current collector in LIBs, can be replaced with the cheaper Al for NIBs.6−8 Second, Na resources are more widespread and abundant than Li-based raw materials.1,9 One of the most promising classes of cathode materials is layered oxides, NaxMO2 (M = transition metal).10,11 Within this class, there are several dominant subgroups, which are defined on the basis of the coordination of the Na-ions between the transition metal−oxygen layers. Following the nomenclature introduced by Delmas et al.,12 in O-type materials, Na+ is coordinated by oxygen octahedrally, whereas in P-type materials, the coordination is prismatic. Differences in stacking, i.e., shifts of the layers composed of edge-sharing MO6-octahedra against one another, are indicated by numbers. In a P2-structure, e.g., two layers of MO6octahedra need to be depicted in the unit cell to accurately describe the structure. The first studies on insertion processes into these layered oxides have been conducted in the 1980s.12−17 Recently, particularly P2-type materials have received considerable interest because of their good compromise regarding cycling stability and capacity.18−26 In these Received: November 23, 2015 Revised: March 14, 2016 Published: March 15, 2016 Article pubs.acs.org/cm © 2016 American Chemical Society 2041 DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem.

The variety in terms of composition is immense and is the result of attempts to finetune certain characteristics such as cycling stability, operating potential, capacity, or cost. Thus, understanding the effect of those different transition metals is key to further develop and optimize P2-type layered oxides as cathodes for NIBs. Ni, for example, is employed due to its high redox potential, which elevates the average discharge potential, and thus energy density, of the material.11,24,27 Co in Mn/Co-based layered oxides is an interesting substitution option as Co improves cyclability.28−30 Interestingly, Co is reduced and oxidized in parallel to Mn over the course of cycling.31 Increased cycling stability was also obtained by incorporating Fe.8,11 Fe-doping suppresses minor structural transitions during cycling and concomitant Na+ ordering processes and thus increases capacity retention. Mg both stabilizes the structure by suppressing a structural distortion toward an orthorhombic phase and leads to a smoothening of the charge/discharge curves. However, this is achieved at the expense of capacity. Several combinations of the aforementioned (transition) metals have been reported in attempts to combine the respective advantages.20,32,33 In this report, we focus on better understanding two improvement strategies on the basic P2−NaxMnO2+z structure, namely, substitution of manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% and morphology optimization. It was shown by our group before that substituting 11% of Mn with Co in the P2-NaxMnO2+z structure suppresses Na+ ordering and leads to an increase of cycling stability.29 The underlying structural causes are the focus of this publication. Another influencing factor for NIB performance is the synthetic route. Synthesis conditions affect the amount of defects in the structure,32,34 the morphology,35 and long-range order. We found previously that hollow spheres achieve higher capacity and a better cycling performance than flakes due to less severe morphological degradation over cycling.35 This prompted us to look into the structural aspects of this difference. In this work, the effect of Co-doping and morphology optimization are investigated using operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Manganese dissolution was shown to have a negligible effect on capacity fading using various analytical techniques. It is shown that for P2NaxMnO2+z flakes a two phase region evolves during discharge. Substituting 10% of the Mn with Co suppresses both Na+ ordering processes and the transition of the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombic phase. These effects are identified as possible causes for improved cycling performance. Moreover, it is shown that the enhanced conductivity adds to the positive influence of a minor substitution of Mn with Co. Enhanced cycling performance of the spherical over the flake-like morphology is attributed to smaller changes of the volume of the unit cell during cycling for the spheres. Finally, both approaches were combined in the synthesis of spherical P2Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9MnO2, which shows a significant improvement in cycling stability. Thus, the advantage of a variation of a previously investigated optimization strategy, doping, and a novel promising approach, spherical morphologies, were demonstrated. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis and Coin Cell Preparation. NaxMnO2+z (NMO) and NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2+z (NCO) flakes were synthesized by combustion synthesis as described previously.29,36−38 NaNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and Mn(CH3COO)2 (Alfa Aesar, anhydrous, 98%) were mixed (molar ratio Na:Mn = 0.7) and subsequently dissolved in deionized water. For NCO, additional Co(NO3)2 was added, such that the molar ratio of Na:Co:Mn was 0.7:0.1:0.9. Concentrated HNO3 (≥69%, Honeywell) was added, followed by 1.5 g of gelatin. The solution was heated until spontaneous combustion occurred. The resulting dark brownish powder was annealed at 800 °C for 4 h, followed by another step at 610 °C for 9 h and quenching to room temperature. Elemental composition, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), was Na0.6MnO2+z for the NMO flakes and Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+z for the NCO flakes; “z” in the above-mentioned formula units accounts for Mn-vacancies and is typically between 0.05 and 0.25 for the P2 phase.13 Spherical NMO was synthesized as reported previously, with a slightly modified annealing procedure.35 NH4HCO3 was dissolved in deionized water, followed by a dropwise addition of ethanol (10% volume of the NH4HCO3 solution) and a solution of MnSO4 in deionized water. To form spherical MnCO3, the solution was stirred at room temperature. After filtration and subsequent washing, the product was annealed in air at 400 °C for 5 h to form MnO2. Then, it was dispersed in a solution of NaOH in deionized water and ethanol. Next, both water and ethanol were evaporated, and the residue was first annealed at 320 °C in air for 3 h, followed by an annealing step in air at 800 °C for 4 h and an additional step at 610 °C for 9 h and finally by quenching to room temperature. Chemical composition according to ICP-OES was Na0.7MnO2+z. For NCO spheres the same process was employed; however, CoSO4 was added to the MnSO4 solution to achieve a 10% ratio of cobalt in the final product. Chemical composition according to ICP-OES was Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+z. As shown previously,35 the surface area of flakes and spheres as measured by BET is ∼5 m2 g−1 for both materials. Coin cells (2016) were prepared with metallic sodium as the negative electrode, and a composite cathode made from active material, acetylene black (Alfa Aesar, >99%), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Arkema, Kynar HSV 900) with a weight ratio 6:2:2 coated on aluminum foil. Glass fiber (Whatman) was used as a separator. The electrolyte was a 1 M solution of NaClO4 (SigmaAldrich, ≥98%) in a mixture of propylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.7%) and ethylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) with a weight ratio of 1:1. Synchrotron operando XRD was performed with 2016 coin cells with a 3 mm hole drilled through the casing. Subsequently, they were sealed by Kapton foil with a thickness of 25 μm and epoxy resin. A Na-metal ring was used as anode (Ø = 16 mm, hole = 3 mm in diameter). To ensure a sufficient amount of active material in the beam’s path a pellet was prepared (∼10 mg active material) with teflonized acetylene black as binder and acetylene black (weight ratio 6:2:2), which was then pressed onto aluminum foil. Physical Characterization. Synchrotron XRD measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (beamline 11-3) using an X-ray energy of 12.7 keV (wavelength λ = 0.974 Å) and a MAR345 image plate detector (Rayonix). The sample−detector distance was 166.9 mm, enabling collection of data in the scattering vector (q) range of 0.45−5.00 Å−1, where q = (4π sin θ)/λ, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and θ is the Bragg angle. The 2D diffraction data was reduced to 1D and converted to 2θ° using the GSAS2 software for better comparability.39 In this work, structural developments are depicted for the first discharge (Figures 3 −8). All observed changes of the lattice parameters and structural transitions were found to be reversible in the subsequent charge. All operando measurements were conducted between 3.8−1.5 V vs Na|Na+. A Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (100 mA, 45 kV) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54 Å) was used for laboratory scale powder XRD measurements in reflection mode. The PDXL software (Rigaku) was used for the Rietveld refinement, the whole pattern fit (Pawley fit), and the Debye−Scherrer method. Field emission scanning Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2042 electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed using a Zeiss Supra 55 FESEM. A Dual-view Optima 5300 DV system was used for ICP-OES. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100. For the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) a Varian SpectrAA 220FS spectrometer was used. Electrochemistry. Galvanostatic cycling was performed on a Neware battery tester system in a coin cell setup. Galvanostatic cycling for the operando XRD was conducted on a MTI CT-3008W-5 V1 mAS1 instrument. It should be noted that during the initial charge process for the NCO spheres an interruption in the operando experiment occurred due to technical difficulties. In typical coin cell tests, Codoped and undoped spheres show similar initial capacities (Figure 2). GITT was performed on a Biologic VMP3 potentiostat. A constant current pulse of 50 mA was applied for 200 s, followed by an OCV relaxation period of 5 h. When the voltage changed by less than 2 mV h−1 the next current pulse was applied. The data was analyzed using eq 1 for the diffusion coefficient, π = δ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ( ) ( ) D iV z FS 4 E d E d t m A 2 d d 2 (1) where Vm is the molar volume of the unit cell, I is the applied current, zA is the charge number, F is Faraday’s constant, S is the electrode/ electrolyte contact area (approximated as the geometric surface area of the electrode), δ E d d is the slope of the Coulometric titration curve, and E t d d is the slope of the linearized plot of the potential E during the current pulse. Volume changes during the cycling process were neglected, as the diffusion coefficient changes significantly (several orders of magnitude), whereas the unit cell volume only changes by several percent. In situ EIS was performed at various potentials on a BioLogic VMP 3 with the EC-lab software in a 3-electrode glass cell setup, using Na-metal as counter and reference electrode, and the active material (composite cathode) as working electrode. After charging/discharging to the respective voltage (at 50 mA g−1) the potential was kept for 30 min, followed by a relaxation step of 2 h and the impedance measurement in OCV mode. The impedance fit was conducted using the Z Fit function of the EC-lab software. Manganese Dissolution Analysis. For the manganese dissolution tests a beaker cell (7.5 mL) was constructed. The cathode was the active material composite coated on aluminum foil (50 × 20 mm) covering the complete inner wall of the beaker. Relatively large amounts (∼15 mg) of the active material, specifically NMO flakes, which show the highest capacity fading, were employed to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The anode was an aluminum wire covered with Na-metal, which was fixed in the center of the cell. Two layers of glass fiber separator were placed between anode and cathode to prevent short circuiting. After adding 6.0 mL of electrolyte the cell was sealed and operated between 10 and 40 cycles. Afterward, the metallic sodium was dissolved in pure ethanol and all cell parts were rinsed with ethanol and combined with the extracted electrolyte. For EDS the solution was heated (120 °C) on a copper foil until a dry black powder was obtained. For ICP the solution was acidified and the majority of the organic parts were oxidized under heating. Afterward, the solution was filled to a specific volume with deionized water in a calibrated flask. For AAS the solution could be used as is after further dilution. Assuming all capacity loss is attributed to Mn dissolution, the concentrations should be 22 ppm (ICP) and 10 ppm (AAS) in the analysis sample, respectively. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physical Characterization. The crystal structure of the asprepared NMO flakes and hollow spheres as well as NCO flakes and hollow spheres was identified to have a hexagonal unit cell of the P2-type class (space group P63/mmc, Figure S1). For all materials, the lattice parameters were found to be approximately a = b ≈2.87 Å and c ≈11.1 Å (for exact values see Table S1). The difference in the lattice parameters of the initial NMO and NCO can be explained by a contraction of the lattice induced by cobalt.28 For NMO spheres the differences in the lattice as compared to NMO flakes is due to an initially higher Na+ content of the spheres. The difference of the lattice parameters between NCO flakes and NCO spheres is negligible. The (hkl) reflections of the hollow spheres are broader than the flakes’, as can be seen exemplarily for the most intense reflection (002), which has a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of 2θ° = 0.30 for the NMO spheres and 0.12° for the NMO flakes. Paulsen et al.28 indicated that the employed short annealing time can lead to stacking faults or inhomogeneities of the Na+ distribution, which would explain the breadth of the reflections of the spheres. In addition, the flakes had crystallographic texture and, thus, a thorough Rietveld refinement for the operando data is challenging and beyond the scope of this publication. Phases were identified using the Pawley approach to fit the whole pattern; for powder material of both NMO and NCO flakes a Rietveld refinement was employed (International Crystal Structure Database, ICSD50301). For a comparison of the differences in crystallite size between flakes and spheres the Debye−Scherrer method was applied to both Co-doped versions as they are more crystalline than the undoped analogues. According to the Debye−Scherrer analysis, the NCO flakes have an average crystallite size of 605 nm whereas for the NCO spheres the respective size is 345 nm. As can be seen in Figure 1 the size of the flakes is on the order of micrometers. However, considering the limitations of the Debye−Scherrer equation (e.g., value of the shape factor), it cannot be excluded that the flakes are single crystals. The flakes’ diameter and thickness vary (Figure 1a). The hollow spheres have an outer diameter of approximately 5 μm, and their outer shells are built up of hexagonal layered flakes (Figure 1b). The shell thickness is comparable to the thickness of the synthesized flakes. Electrochemical Studies. For the galvanostatic cycle tests at 20 mA g−1 the cells were first charged to 3.8 V, followed by a discharge which is displayed in Figure 2a. NMO flakes showed a discharge capacity of 147 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 41 mA h g−1, and the NCO flakes exhibited a discharge capacity of 153 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 30 mA h g−1. For NMO spheres, the first discharge capacity was 188 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 106 mA h g−1 and for the NCO spheres the first discharge capacity was 183 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 55 mA h g−1. Potential reasons for the higher capacity of the spheres are stacking faults as mentioned above or an increased amount of defects as a result of the synthetic route. NMO flakes show various minor plateaus during discharge indicating Na+ Figure 1. FESEM pictures of pristine NCO (a) flakes, (b) spheres. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2043 ordering processes.27,29,40−42 For the curve of the NMO spheres, these features are enhanced, whereas neither NCO flakes nor NCO spheres exhibit most of these minor plateaus. The minor plateaus, and the lack thereof for the doped materials, can easily be seen when plotting the derivative of the potential with respect to the capacity (Figure S2). Co-doped spheres, which have not been presented in literature before, show a capacity increase as compared to the NCO flakes, while lacking distinct features in the discharge curve as opposed to NMO spheres. For galvanostatic cycle tests at 50 mA g−1 (Figure 2b), NCO flakes (71% capacity retention over 100 cycles and 65% after 150 cycles) show an improvement in cycling stability over NMO flakes (59%/52%). The same effect of doping is observed for the spherical morphology. While spheres have higher capacity retention than flakes for both doped and undoped material, the Co-doped spheres are more stable than the undoped NMO spheres (75% vs 67% after 100 cycles and 67% vs 58% at 150 cycles). Moreover, Co-doped materials also show better rate capability (Figure 2c). At a current rate of 400 mA g−1 (∼2.2C), the obtained capacity is 120 mA h g−1. Possible reasons for the observed effects are discussed below. Manganese Dissolution. The observed fading prompted us to investigate Mn2+ dissolution from the active materials following a potential disproportionation of Mn3+ into Mn2+ and Mn4+.30,43,44 Calculations on the hypothetical amount of manganese in the electrolyte, assuming that capacity fading is only due to manganese dissolution, show that the respective values (∼10−20 ppm) are significantly above the detection limits for ICP, AAS, and EDS. However, neither ICP, nor AAS, nor EDS measurements of the processed and concentrated electrolyte were able to detect dissolved manganese. The Mn detection limit for these methods is ∼1 ppm, so that the amount of dissolved Mn (if any) is <1 ppm. Consequently, a capacity fading of ≥1% should be detectable by these methods if it were resulting from Mn dissolution. Thus, it can be concluded that manganese dissolution has a negligible effect on capacity fading of the P2-type materials presented in this work and cannot explain the differences between the respective materials. Structural Studies. In the following sections, the structural processes as a further cause of the different cycling performances are investigated. NMO Flakes. During discharge (3.8 V−1.5 V), the Na+ content (x) increased from 0.46 to 0.98. The (002) reflection shifts to a higher angle, reflecting a contraction of the unit cell along the c-lattice parameter (Figure 3a). As Na+ inserts between the MnO6 layers, the negative charges of the oxygen between different layers are screened, which moves the layers closer together. The shift of the (010) reflection to lower angles reflects an expansion of the unit cell along the aand bdirections (Figure 3b). The cause of this is a decrease of the oxidation state of manganese during discharge, which results in an expansion of the MnO6-octahedra and, therefore, an expansion of the aand b-lattice parameters.18,22 Two different phases can be observed during discharge. Initially, the hexagonal P2-type phase of the pristine material is maintained up to a Na+ loading of ∼0.87. Then, new reflections occur in the pattern (at 2θ° = 21.3, 23.6, 26.2, 29.6, 37.8, 38.9, 43.1, 45.0; see Figure 4; minor impurity from hydrated phase45,46) and become more intense until the end of the discharge at 1.5 V. Moreover, an overlap of a reflection from the original pattern with a reflection from the newly emerging phase is detectable (2θ° ≈10.2). These new reflections are in line with an orthorhombic phase. Typically, this phase is called the P′2 phase.13,18,47 In Figure 3a the c-lattice parameter development of the initial P2 and the evolving P′2 phase is displayed (Table S2 shows aand b-lattice parameters of P′2). Figure 5a shows the diffraction pattern of the NMO flakes at 1.5 V, as well as the simulated pattern for both the initial hexagonal phase and of the newly formed orthorhombic phase (Cmcm space group). The new reflections in the pattern fit well with the orthorhombic phase. Other reflections that occur at similar positions for both the new orthorhombic and the initial hexagonal phase show a broadening of the reflections in the diffraction pattern due to an overlap of the reflections from the two phases. This phase transition is attributed to the increased amount of Jahn−Teller active Mn3+ in its d4 high-spin configuration. The resulting distortion leads to a transformation of the hexagonal to the orthorhombic unit cell. In the subsequent charge process, the P′2 phase disappears.47 To check whether the phase change is partially irreversible, the NMO flakes|Na-half cell was cycled offline, and the diffraction Figure 2.

Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2044 patterns at OCV were measured after 5, 10, and 15 cycles. However, no remnant of the P′2 phase could be identified. Thus, it is concluded that the phase transformation is reversible. NCO Flakes. The Na+ content changes from 0.49 to 1.0 during discharge. Developments of the lattice parameters are similar to NMO flakes (Figure 3a,b). The c-lattice parameters decrease by 0.11 Å, and the a/b-lattice parameters increase by 0.08 Å. This is also reflected in the unit cell volume, which, for both materials, increases by ∼4 Å3 (4.5%) over the course of the full discharge (Figure 3c). However, during discharge, no new phase could be detected even though the amount of inserted Na+ was similar to NMO flakes (Figure 6). In contrast to high-spin Mn3+, which distorts the structure, Co3+ is Jahn− Figure 3. First discharge (after an initial charge process).

This suggests that substituting manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% has a stabilizing effect. Moreover, as shown in the Electrochemical Studies, Co suppresses Na+ ordering processes in the structure, which otherwise occur for the undoped material. These two effects eliminate structural heterogeneity that inherently occurs as the result of repeated structural transformations. The suppression of these phase transitions is suggested to be the reason for the enhanced cycling stability of the NCO flakes over the NMO flakes. NCO Spheres. In order to examine whether morphology has an influence on these transitions, spherical NCO, for which no phase transition is anticipated due to the suppression of transitions by Co-doping, is discussed here. During discharge from 3.8−1.5 V, Na+ content was increased over a wider range: from 0.43 to 1.05. As can be seen in Figure 7, similar to NCO flakes, no phase change occurs. Thus, the difference in cycling stability between the flakes and spheres cannot be the consequence of phase transitions. While the change of the clattice parameter is similar to that of the NCO flakes, the blattice parameter, and therefore also the unit cell volume, changes less severely (Figure 3). Thus, the stress on the crystal structure is reduced as compared to the flakes and the volume expansion of the spheres (∼2.3%) while discharging from 3.8− 1.5 V is only half the volume change of the flakes (∼4.8%). The effect on the structure is exacerbated by the anisotropic expansion of the lattice parameters. As the c-lattice parameter decreases during Na+ insertion, the expansion of the unit cell volume is based on an increase of the aand b-lattice parameter, i.e., an expansion within the plane of MnO6-octahedra. This difference might be one contributing factor to the superior cycling stability of spheres over flakes and could be the cause of the difference in the preservation of morphology over the course of cycling described previously.35 Comparison of Strain Distribution. For undoped materials, the phase change giving rise to additional overlapping reflections makes detailed comparison of the structures difficult. However, given there is no phase transition at high Na+ content for Co-doped materials we can directly compare NCO spheres and NCO flakes. As described above, the volume change is greater for the flakes. Despite the ability to accommodate a slightly larger amount of Na+ in the structure of the NCO spheres (1.05 Na+ for NCO spheres compared to 1.00 Na+ for NCO flakes), the shift in the (002) reflection to higher 2θ° angles for NCO spheres is particularly modest. While one may not be able to infer much from the contraction along the cdirection, observable differences in the FWHM are apparent for the (002) and (004) reflection for the NCO spheres as detailed in Table S3. Here we look at the relative ratio of FWHM(004)/ FWHM(002). For the NCO flakes, while there is no appreciable change in the ratio (within the error) when increasing the Na+ content from 0.6 (OCV) to 1.0, there is a modest observable variation at a low sodium content of 0.49 Na+ (FWHM(004)/ FWHM(002) = 1.18). This possibly indicates a larger distribution of strain in the material. The ratio FWHM(004)/FWHM(002) is larger for NCO spheres. While it is ∼1 around OCV (0.5−0.6 Na+), it is >1 when moving away from OCV in either direction, i.e., for Na+ < 0.5 and Na+ > 0.6. This suggests that although there is a lesser volume change for the spheres, a greater degree of strain distribution in the material is present at high and low Na+ loading, implying possible inhomogeneities in the distribution of Na+ concentration throughout the material. While the mechanism by which this takes place is unclear, it is postulated that this ability to accommodate strain rather than release it in the form of lattice expansion may have two effects: (i) protect the material from structural fatigue during successive cycling leading to superior cycling stability and (ii) facilitate the broader range of sodium content. While it is not possible to observe such differences in the FWHM for NMO spheres for the aforementioned reasons, given the similar performance of the materials it is hypothesized that the same strain accommodation ability may also be one of the reasons for superior cycling stability and capacity of NMO spheres as compared to flakes. NMO Spheres. Na+ content increases from 0.35 to 1.02 during discharge. The development of the diffraction patterns of NMO spheres shows three different phases in the course of one discharge (Figure 8). In the charged state, i.e., at Na+ contents between 0.35−0.49, the diffraction pattern shows a two phase region with reflections from a nonhexagonal phase. From a Na+ loading of 0.82, new reflections (2θ° ≈20.8, 36.3, 37.8, 42.3) and a broadening of the (010) reflection at 2θ° ≈ 22.5 are observed. Moreover, a significant broadening of the (002) reflection (2θ° ≈10.3) at the end of the discharge is visible. The reflections at low sodium content are attributed to a so-called “Z” phase, which represents a structure in which, based on the initial P2-type structure, the layers of MnO6octahedra are shifted.18,47 Even though in some publications an OP4 phase is reported,8,21 Talaie et al. modeled this newly emerging phase with an O2 2 × 2 × 10 supercell, in which the position of the respective layers was randomized.18 According Figure 6. Pattern development for NCO flakes (synchrotron radiation: λ = 0.974 Å, * denote aluminum reflections). Figure 7. Pattern development for NCO spheres (synchrotron radiation: λ = 0.974 Å, * denotes aluminum reflections). Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2046 to Mortemard de Boisse et al., this phase with its lack of longrange order for the MO2 constituents is most suitably called “Z” phase.47 This phase, however, disappeared during discharge. From a Na+ content of 0.49, only the initial P2-stacking order is detectable. In Figure S3a the c-lattice of the original P2 and the “Z” phase of the NMO spheres are shown. In the two phase region, i.e., at a low Na+ content, the c-lattice of the P2 phase stays rather constant. With the disappearance of the “Z” phase the c-lattice of the P2 phase increases until the electrostatic interaction between Na+ and the Mn−O layers results in a decrease of the interlayer distance. Over the development of the single P2 phase region, the a/b-lattice parameter does not change significantly, leading to a smaller volume change of the NMO spheres compared to NMO flakes (Figure S3b,c). The occurrence of the P′2 phase is not as clear as for the NMO flakes. The new reflections at 20.8 and 42.3 as well as the broadening around 10.3 2θ° could indicate the P′2 phase. However, a new reflection at 2θ° ≈36.8 is not in line with an emerging P′2 phase, which suggests that another new phase is formed. Moreover, the prominent reflections between 2θ° = 23−30, which are indicative of a unit cell with the Cmcm space group, are absent. This suggests that the contribution from the P′2 phase is small. Occasionally, impurities from differences in the MnO2 stacking can occur during synthesis. Nevertheless, a comparison of the newly emerging reflections with the patterns of the related layered P3, O3, and O′3 phase showed that these phases do not explain the new reflections.33,48 A structure that could explain the unidentified reflection at 36 2θ°, and also the aforementioned reflections at 21 and 42 2θ°, is cubic Na3MnO4 (space group P213). Although this structure is not in line with the layered oxide structure, the precursor for our spherical P2type NMO was amorphous MnO2, which, at synthesis temperature, is converted to Mn2O3 which crystallizes in a cubic structure. Thus, a minor part of the Mn2O3 precursor might not have been transformed to P2-type NMO during the annealing process and has taken up Na+ at potentials of 2.2−1.5 Figure 8.

For the undoped materials the two phase regions are indicated. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2047 V vs Na|Na+, possibly resulting in the detectable presence of this phase. A shoulder at 2θ° = 20.6, where Mn2O3 has its most intense reflection, supports this hypothesis. The mechanism for this transformation and the concomitant change in the Mn:O ratio, however, is still unclear. There may have been unreacted amorphous MnOx that can have crystallized. Figure 5b shows the diffraction pattern of the NMO spheres at OCV and at 1.5 V, as well as simulated patterns of the initial P2 phase, and of the potentially formed P′2 phase and cubic P213 space group. Sharma et al. recently showed that, even for the same material, the formation of the P′2 phase depends on the current rate at which the material is cycled, i.e., on kinetic factors.49 These factors could be influenced by stacking faults or defects in the structure. Different tendencies for NMO flakes and spheres to form the P′2 phase could therefore be attributed to different kinetic behavior, such as nucleation of the new phase. The smaller changes in the unit cell volume of the spheres, in combination with the lower concentration of the P′2 phase throughout cycling, reduce structural stresses and fatigue. These effects are considered to be the leading contributors to the observed higher cycling stability of the materials with spherical morphology. The NCO spheres do not show the impurity attributed to the Mn2O3 precursor. Moreover, the Co-doped materials have a larger average crystallite size than the undoped analogues, as indicated by sharper reflections in the XRD pattern. This is in line with findings by Paulsen et al. that incorporating Co into the structure can facilitate the formation of the P2 phase during synthesis.28 Thus, the Co-doped materials are anticipated to contain a lower degree of amorphous/untransformed material, which can crystallize in the suspected cubic phase. In our measurements, the “Z” phase was not observed for low Na+ contents for the NCO spheres. However, Na+ content during the initial charge might just not have been decreased sufficiently to induce the formation of the “Z” phase. Diffusion and Conductivity Properties. Filling up a given structure with Na+ influences the mobility of these Naions and, thus, affects diffusion properties. As structural changes result in different pathways along which Na+ can move in the structure, phase transitions also have an effect on diffusion. To elucidate these changes, GITT and in situ EIS were performed. Figure 9 shows the development of the effective diffusion coefficients for all materials during the course of one discharge as measured by GITT. Minima of the diffusion coefficient are indicative of the exhaustion of certain processes or structural rearrangements.50 Between a Na+ content of 0.45 and 0.67, i.e., the solid solution region, diffusion coefficients are comparable, and develop in parallel, for all materials. The diffusion coefficient is between 10−9−10−10 cm2 s−1, which is considered to indicate fast diffusion processes for an insertion material. Minor changes (i.e., minima) can be observed in this region for undoped NMO flakes (Figure 9a) and spheres (Figure 9c), which correlate well with small plateaus in the discharge curve that signify Na+ ordering processes (Figure 2a). At a Na+ content of ∼0.67, diffusion coefficients for all materials start decreasing. For Na+ contents beyond that, the values diverge. NMO flakes show a local minimum at a Na+ content of ∼0.77 (DNa+ ≈10−12 cm2 s−1), followed by an increase and, subsequently, another minimum (DNa+ ≈10−13 cm2 s−1). Both the electrochemistry and GITT measurements suggest the start of a first structural transition at a Na+ content of ∼0.7. The diffraction data, however, did not show any phase change in this region (Figure 4). This minimum can be explained by a high concentration overpotential, which results in a rearrangement of the Na-ions between the MnO6-layers and thus in changes of the diffusion properties. The second minimum at x = 0.97 is attributed to the phase transition toward the orthorhombic phase as observed by synchrotron XRD (Figures 4 and 5a). GITT measurements suggest the phase transition takes place at a slightly higher Na+ content than indicated by XRD. This difference can possibly be attributed to the nature of the GITT analysis. For the calculation of the Na+ content, only the Na+ insertion induced by the applied current is considered, while minor deviations from the typical galvanostatic behavior have been observed for this method before.47,50,51 Slower relaxation times during the major plateau at ∼2.2−2.1 V as compared to the solid solution region (e.g., ∼2.9 V) are attributed to a decrease of electric and/or ionic conductivity (Figure S4). Except for this second minimum at high Na+ contents, NCO flakes (Figure 9b) show the same trend as NMO flakes, i.e., the same position for the main minima and maxima, albeit at considerable higher values for the diffusion coefficient (DNa+ ≈ 10−12 cm2 s−1 for the minimum). This increase is attributed to the effect of the Co. For NMO spheres (Figure 9c) the trend is similar to the NMO flakes. However, the structural transition at ∼0.7 starts at a minimum value of DNa+ ≈10−10 cm2 s−1, followed by a decrease to lower values for the diffusion coefficient (DNa+ ≈10−12 cm2 s−1) at a Na+ content of x ≈0.88. Moreover, a third minimum occurs at a Na+ content of ∼1.02. The diffusion coefficient of the last minimum is comparable to the minimum of the NMO flakes which was attributed to the phase transition toward the P′2 phase. This substantiates the hypothesis of a phase transition from the hexagonal P63/mmc to the orthorhombic Cmcm phase discussed in the section on Structural Studies. The minimum which indicates the phase transition toward an orthorhombic phase for both NMO materials can be seen neither for the Co-doped flakes nor spheres. This is in line with suppression of the phase transition as concluded in the Structural Studies section. Over the whole P2 phase region both NCO flakes and spheres exhibit higher diffusion coefficients than the undoped analogues. This is explained by enhancement of the Na+ conductivity as a result of Co-doping. This higher conductivity is also reflected in the rate capability, which is better for the Co-doped materials (Figure 2c). The reason for the lower conductivity of the undoped material is attributed to the high resistivity induced by the Mn3+, which, in its d4 high-spin configuration, is a Jahn−Teller active ion and has more localized electrons to interact with the positively charged sodium.52,53 For LiMnO2, doping results in a suppression of the Jahn−Teller effect, which lowers the diffusion barrier and thus increases ionic conductivity.54 A similar effect is assumed here. Moreover, the suppression of the Na+ ordering may further facilitate the Na+ transport between the layers. These findings have been confirmed by EIS (Table S5 and Figure S5) in a three-electrode setup for NMO and NCO flakes at various potentials. Even though the trend for the chargetransfer resistance is similar in the beginning, i.e., in the first charge and the first part of the subsequent discharge, the values for NMO flakes and NCO flakes diverge at approximately 2.5 V, shortly before the onset of the pronounced plateau. In the plateau, while there are no phase transitions osidbserved in the XRD, the increase of charge transfer resistance of NMO is one order of magnitude larger than the respective value for NCO flakes. This provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that the stabilizing effect of Co is not limited to Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2048 structural stabilization but can also improve cycling stability through enhanced ionic conductivity in the electrode. ■CONCLUSION P2-type NaxMnO2 and NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2 were synthesized in two different morphologies, hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres. Their structural and diffusion properties in the context of sodium-ion battery cathodes were investigated using in operando synchrotron XRD, GITT, and in situ EIS. In addition, dissolved manganese could not be detected in the electrolyte for NMO flakes over the course of cycling and is therefore thought to play a negligible role. P2-NaxMnO2 flakes undergo partial phase transition toward an orthorhombic crystal system upon the insertion of Na+, while Co-doping on the order of 10% suppresses these structural transformations. The lack of repeated phase transitions might reduce inhomogeneity in the structure and, together with the suppression of Na+ ordering processes, explain the better cycling stability of the doped material. In addition to the beneficial structural effects, Codoping is also shown to have a positive influence on Na-ion transport within the structure. This not only explains the better rate capability of doped vs undoped materials but could also contribute toward improved cycling stability. Superior cycling stability of hollow spheres as compared to flakes is attributed to the reduced volume expansion and contraction for the spheres. Thus, increased strain within the structure of the spheres is one explanation for this difference. Moreover, the spherical material shows a higher capacity, which is attributed to structural defects. The effects of Co-doping are different from the intended effect for other transition metals. Incorporating elements such as Ni or Fe into the structure aims at increasing energy density by exploiting the high potential of their respective redox reactions. In addition, Yabuuchi et al. showed that incorporating 50% of Fe into the structure increases cycling stability by suppressing Na+ ordering processes;8 however, Fe does not prevent phase transformation in the lower voltage region.18,22,47 Ni-substitution, on the other hand, does not eliminate Na+ ordering processes but enhances structural stability by alleviating the Jahn−Teller distortion and delaying the phase transitions between 2.1−1.5 V.21,24,27,46 Incorporating a relatively small amount of Co\\ue0d5as low as 10%\\ue0d5into the structure enhances Na+ conductivity, suppresses Na+ ordering, and prevents phase transformation between 2.1− 1.5 V and thus allows a more reversible exploitation of the capacity that can be obtained in this voltage region. A combined approach of the two presented material optimization routes, i.e., doping and morphology optimization, has been shown to be most successful in attaining superior capacity and cycling stability for the investigated materials. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557.

    "Good preservation of logical document structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure and section headers are mostly correctly placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superscripts, subscripts, and special characters are normalized nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally introduces artifacts like \"ﬁ\" instead of \"fi\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Some minor layout inconsistencies in highly formatted sections (e.g., tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "🟡 2. **pdfplumber (file: Na-Mn-O-pdfplumber.txt) — Score: 77/100\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Very good at preserving line-by-line formatting, particularly for figures/tables.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Excessive line breaks disrupt paragraph-level cohesion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes breaks mid-sentence due to hard carriage returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Header/footer text sometimes intermingles with body content.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 3. **PyPDF (file: Na-Mn-O-pypdf.txt) — Score: 54/100\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts raw text with some semantic boundaries preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",

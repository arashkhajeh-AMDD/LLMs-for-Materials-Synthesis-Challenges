To compare the effect of two improvement strategies for metal oxide cathodes, specifically Codoping and morphology optimization, four representatives of the prominent material class of layered NaxMO2 (M = transition metal) have been studied: hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres of P2− NaxMnO2 and P2−NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2. The better electrochemical performance of the spheres over the flakes and of the Co-doped over the undoped materials are explained on the basis of structural features revealed by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The higher cycling stability of the material doped with ∼10% Co is attributed to three effects: (i) the suppression of a Jahn−Tellerinduced structural transition from the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombic phase that is observed in NaxMnO2; (ii) suppression of ordering processes of Na+; and (iii) enhanced Na+ kinetics as revealed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique measurements and in situ electrochemical impedance measurements. Increased capacity and cycling stability of spheres over flakes may be related to smaller changes of the unit cell volume of spheres and thus to reduced structural stress. Co-doped spheres combine the advantages of both strategies and exhibit the best cycling stability. ■INTRODUCTION Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have received significant attention recently and are considered a viable alternative to the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1−5 NIBs have a cost advantage over LIBs for two main reasons. Na, unlike Li, does not alloy with Al in the anodic potential region. Thus, Cu, which is used as the anodic current collector in LIBs, can be replaced with the cheaper Al for NIBs.6−8 Second, Na resources are more widespread and abundant than Li-based raw materials.1,9 One of the most promising classes of cathode materials is layered oxides, NaxMO2 (M = transition metal).10,11 Within this class, there are several dominant subgroups, which are defined on the basis of the coordination of the Na-ions between the transition metal−oxygen layers. Following the nomenclature introduced by Delmas et al.,12 in O-type materials, Na+ is coordinated by oxygen octahedrally, whereas in P-type materials, the coordination is prismatic. Differences in stacking, i.e., shifts of the layers composed of edge-sharing MO6-octahedra against one another, are indicated by numbers. In a P2-structure, e.g., two layers of MO6octahedra need to be depicted in the unit cell to accurately describe the structure. The first studies on insertion processes into these layered oxides have been conducted in the 1980s.12−17 Recently, particularly P2-type materials have received considerable interest because of their good compromise regarding cycling stability and capacity.18−26 In these Received: November 23, 2015 Revised: March 14, 2016 Published: March 15, 2016 Article pubs.acs.org/cm © 2016 American Chemical Society 2041 DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem.

The variety in terms of composition is immense and is the result of attempts to finetune certain characteristics such as cycling stability, operating potential, capacity, or cost. Thus, understanding the effect of those different transition metals is key to further develop and optimize P2-type layered oxides as cathodes for NIBs. Ni, for example, is employed due to its high redox potential, which elevates the average discharge potential, and thus energy density, of the material.11,24,27 Co in Mn/Co-based layered oxides is an interesting substitution option as Co improves cyclability.28−30 Interestingly, Co is reduced and oxidized in parallel to Mn over the course of cycling.31 Increased cycling stability was also obtained by incorporating Fe.8,11 Fe-doping suppresses minor structural transitions during cycling and concomitant Na+ ordering processes and thus increases capacity retention. Mg both stabilizes the structure by suppressing a structural distortion toward an orthorhombic phase and leads to a smoothening of the charge/discharge curves. However, this is achieved at the expense of capacity. Several combinations of the aforementioned (transition) metals have been reported in attempts to combine the respective advantages.20,32,33 In this report, we focus on better understanding two improvement strategies on the basic P2−NaxMnO2+z structure, namely, substitution of manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% and morphology optimization. It was shown by our group before that substituting 11% of Mn with Co in the P2-NaxMnO2+z structure suppresses Na+ ordering and leads to an increase of cycling stability.29 The underlying structural causes are the focus of this publication. Another influencing factor for NIB performance is the synthetic route. Synthesis conditions affect the amount of defects in the structure,32,34 the morphology,35 and long-range order. We found previously that hollow spheres achieve higher capacity and a better cycling performance than flakes due to less severe morphological degradation over cycling.35 This prompted us to look into the structural aspects of this difference. In this work, the effect of Co-doping and morphology optimization are investigated using operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Manganese dissolution was shown to have a negligible effect on capacity fading using various analytical techniques. It is shown that for P2NaxMnO2+z flakes a two phase region evolves during discharge. Substituting 10% of the Mn with Co suppresses both Na+ ordering processes and the transition of the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombic phase. These effects are identified as possible causes for improved cycling performance. Moreover, it is shown that the enhanced conductivity adds to the positive influence of a minor substitution of Mn with Co. Enhanced cycling performance of the spherical over the flake-like morphology is attributed to smaller changes of the volume of the unit cell during cycling for the spheres. Finally, both approaches were combined in the synthesis of spherical P2Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9MnO2, which shows a significant improvement in cycling stability. Thus, the advantage of a variation of a previously investigated optimization strategy, doping, and a novel promising approach, spherical morphologies, were demonstrated. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis and Coin Cell Preparation. NaxMnO2+z (NMO) and NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2+z (NCO) flakes were synthesized by combustion synthesis as described previously.29,36−38 NaNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and Mn(CH3COO)2 (Alfa Aesar, anhydrous, 98%) were mixed (molar ratio Na:Mn = 0.7) and subsequently dissolved in deionized water. For NCO, additional Co(NO3)2 was added, such that the molar ratio of Na:Co:Mn was 0.7:0.1:0.9. Concentrated HNO3 (≥69%, Honeywell) was added, followed by 1.5 g of gelatin. The solution was heated until spontaneous combustion occurred. The resulting dark brownish powder was annealed at 800 °C for 4 h, followed by another step at 610 °C for 9 h and quenching to room temperature. Elemental composition, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), was Na0.6MnO2+z for the NMO flakes and Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+z for the NCO flakes; “z” in the above-mentioned formula units accounts for Mn-vacancies and is typically between 0.05 and 0.25 for the P2 phase.13 Spherical NMO was synthesized as reported previously, with a slightly modified annealing procedure.35 NH4HCO3 was dissolved in deionized water, followed by a dropwise addition of ethanol (10% volume of the NH4HCO3 solution) and a solution of MnSO4 in deionized water. To form spherical MnCO3, the solution was stirred at room temperature. After filtration and subsequent washing, the product was annealed in air at 400 °C for 5 h to form MnO2. Then, it was dispersed in a solution of NaOH in deionized water and ethanol. Next, both water and ethanol were evaporated, and the residue was first annealed at 320 °C in air for 3 h, followed by an annealing step in air at 800 °C for 4 h and an additional step at 610 °C for 9 h and finally by quenching to room temperature. Chemical composition according to ICP-OES was Na0.7MnO2+z. For NCO spheres the same process was employed; however, CoSO4 was added to the MnSO4 solution to achieve a 10% ratio of cobalt in the final product. Chemical composition according to ICP-OES was Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+z. As shown previously,35 the surface area of flakes and spheres as measured by BET is ∼5 m2 g−1 for both materials. Coin cells (2016) were prepared with metallic sodium as the negative electrode, and a composite cathode made from active material, acetylene black (Alfa Aesar, >99%), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Arkema, Kynar HSV 900) with a weight ratio 6:2:2 coated on aluminum foil. Glass fiber (Whatman) was used as a separator. The electrolyte was a 1 M solution of NaClO4 (SigmaAldrich, ≥98%) in a mixture of propylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.7%) and ethylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) with a weight ratio of 1:1. Synchrotron operando XRD was performed with 2016 coin cells with a 3 mm hole drilled through the casing. Subsequently, they were sealed by Kapton foil with a thickness of 25 μm and epoxy resin. A Na-metal ring was used as anode (Ø = 16 mm, hole = 3 mm in diameter). To ensure a sufficient amount of active material in the beam’s path a pellet was prepared (∼10 mg active material) with teflonized acetylene black as binder and acetylene black (weight ratio 6:2:2), which was then pressed onto aluminum foil. Physical Characterization. Synchrotron XRD measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (beamline 11-3) using an X-ray energy of 12.7 keV (wavelength λ = 0.974 Å) and a MAR345 image plate detector (Rayonix). The sample−detector distance was 166.9 mm, enabling collection of data in the scattering vector (q) range of 0.45−5.00 Å−1, where q = (4π sin θ)/λ, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and θ is the Bragg angle. The 2D diffraction data was reduced to 1D and converted to 2θ° using the GSAS2 software for better comparability.39 In this work, structural developments are depicted for the first discharge (Figures 3 −8). All observed changes of the lattice parameters and structural transitions were found to be reversible in the subsequent charge. All operando measurements were conducted between 3.8−1.5 V vs Na|Na+. A Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (100 mA, 45 kV) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54 Å) was used for laboratory scale powder XRD measurements in reflection mode. The PDXL software (Rigaku) was used for the Rietveld refinement, the whole pattern fit (Pawley fit), and the Debye−Scherrer method. Field emission scanning Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2042 electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed using a Zeiss Supra 55 FESEM. A Dual-view Optima 5300 DV system was used for ICP-OES. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100. For the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) a Varian SpectrAA 220FS spectrometer was used. Electrochemistry. Galvanostatic cycling was performed on a Neware battery tester system in a coin cell setup. Galvanostatic cycling for the operando XRD was conducted on a MTI CT-3008W-5 V1 mAS1 instrument. It should be noted that during the initial charge process for the NCO spheres an interruption in the operando experiment occurred due to technical difficulties. In typical coin cell tests, Codoped and undoped spheres show similar initial capacities (Figure 2). GITT was performed on a Biologic VMP3 potentiostat. A constant current pulse of 50 mA was applied for 200 s, followed by an OCV relaxation period of 5 h. When the voltage changed by less than 2 mV h−1 the next current pulse was applied. The data was analyzed using eq 1 for the diffusion coefficient, π = δ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ( ) ( ) D iV z FS 4 E d E d t m A 2 d d 2 (1) where Vm is the molar volume of the unit cell, I is the applied current, zA is the charge number, F is Faraday’s constant, S is the electrode/ electrolyte contact area (approximated as the geometric surface area of the electrode), δ E d d is the slope of the Coulometric titration curve, and E t d d is the slope of the linearized plot of the potential E during the current pulse. Volume changes during the cycling process were neglected, as the diffusion coefficient changes significantly (several orders of magnitude), whereas the unit cell volume only changes by several percent. In situ EIS was performed at various potentials on a BioLogic VMP 3 with the EC-lab software in a 3-electrode glass cell setup, using Na-metal as counter and reference electrode, and the active material (composite cathode) as working electrode. After charging/discharging to the respective voltage (at 50 mA g−1) the potential was kept for 30 min, followed by a relaxation step of 2 h and the impedance measurement in OCV mode. The impedance fit was conducted using the Z Fit function of the EC-lab software. Manganese Dissolution Analysis. For the manganese dissolution tests a beaker cell (7.5 mL) was constructed. The cathode was the active material composite coated on aluminum foil (50 × 20 mm) covering the complete inner wall of the beaker. Relatively large amounts (∼15 mg) of the active material, specifically NMO flakes, which show the highest capacity fading, were employed to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The anode was an aluminum wire covered with Na-metal, which was fixed in the center of the cell. Two layers of glass fiber separator were placed between anode and cathode to prevent short circuiting. After adding 6.0 mL of electrolyte the cell was sealed and operated between 10 and 40 cycles. Afterward, the metallic sodium was dissolved in pure ethanol and all cell parts were rinsed with ethanol and combined with the extracted electrolyte. For EDS the solution was heated (120 °C) on a copper foil until a dry black powder was obtained. For ICP the solution was acidified and the majority of the organic parts were oxidized under heating. Afterward, the solution was filled to a specific volume with deionized water in a calibrated flask. For AAS the solution could be used as is after further dilution. Assuming all capacity loss is attributed to Mn dissolution, the concentrations should be 22 ppm (ICP) and 10 ppm (AAS) in the analysis sample, respectively. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physical Characterization. The crystal structure of the asprepared NMO flakes and hollow spheres as well as NCO flakes and hollow spheres was identified to have a hexagonal unit cell of the P2-type class (space group P63/mmc, Figure S1). For all materials, the lattice parameters were found to be approximately a = b ≈2.87 Å and c ≈11.1 Å (for exact values see Table S1). The difference in the lattice parameters of the initial NMO and NCO can be explained by a contraction of the lattice induced by cobalt.28 For NMO spheres the differences in the lattice as compared to NMO flakes is due to an initially higher Na+ content of the spheres. The difference of the lattice parameters between NCO flakes and NCO spheres is negligible. The (hkl) reflections of the hollow spheres are broader than the flakes’, as can be seen exemplarily for the most intense reflection (002), which has a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of 2θ° = 0.30 for the NMO spheres and 0.12° for the NMO flakes. Paulsen et al.28 indicated that the employed short annealing time can lead to stacking faults or inhomogeneities of the Na+ distribution, which would explain the breadth of the reflections of the spheres. In addition, the flakes had crystallographic texture and, thus, a thorough Rietveld refinement for the operando data is challenging and beyond the scope of this publication. Phases were identified using the Pawley approach to fit the whole pattern; for powder material of both NMO and NCO flakes a Rietveld refinement was employed (International Crystal Structure Database, ICSD50301). For a comparison of the differences in crystallite size between flakes and spheres the Debye−Scherrer method was applied to both Co-doped versions as they are more crystalline than the undoped analogues. According to the Debye−Scherrer analysis, the NCO flakes have an average crystallite size of 605 nm whereas for the NCO spheres the respective size is 345 nm. As can be seen in Figure 1 the size of the flakes is on the order of micrometers. However, considering the limitations of the Debye−Scherrer equation (e.g., value of the shape factor), it cannot be excluded that the flakes are single crystals. The flakes’ diameter and thickness vary (Figure 1a). The hollow spheres have an outer diameter of approximately 5 μm, and their outer shells are built up of hexagonal layered flakes (Figure 1b). The shell thickness is comparable to the thickness of the synthesized flakes. Electrochemical Studies. For the galvanostatic cycle tests at 20 mA g−1 the cells were first charged to 3.8 V, followed by a discharge which is displayed in Figure 2a. NMO flakes showed a discharge capacity of 147 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 41 mA h g−1, and the NCO flakes exhibited a discharge capacity of 153 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 30 mA h g−1. For NMO spheres, the first discharge capacity was 188 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 106 mA h g−1 and for the NCO spheres the first discharge capacity was 183 mA h g−1 after an initial charge capacity of 55 mA h g−1. Potential reasons for the higher capacity of the spheres are stacking faults as mentioned above or an increased amount of defects as a result of the synthetic route. NMO flakes show various minor plateaus during discharge indicating Na+ Figure 1. FESEM pictures of pristine NCO (a) flakes, (b) spheres. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2043 ordering processes.27,29,40−42 For the curve of the NMO spheres, these features are enhanced, whereas neither NCO flakes nor NCO spheres exhibit most of these minor plateaus. The minor plateaus, and the lack thereof for the doped materials, can easily be seen when plotting the derivative of the potential with respect to the capacity (Figure S2). Co-doped spheres, which have not been presented in literature before, show a capacity increase as compared to the NCO flakes, while lacking distinct features in the discharge curve as opposed to NMO spheres. For galvanostatic cycle tests at 50 mA g−1 (Figure 2b), NCO flakes (71% capacity retention over 100 cycles and 65% after 150 cycles) show an improvement in cycling stability over NMO flakes (59%/52%). The same effect of doping is observed for the spherical morphology. While spheres have higher capacity retention than flakes for both doped and undoped material, the Co-doped spheres are more stable than the undoped NMO spheres (75% vs 67% after 100 cycles and 67% vs 58% at 150 cycles). Moreover, Co-doped materials also show better rate capability (Figure 2c). At a current rate of 400 mA g−1 (∼2.2C), the obtained capacity is 120 mA h g−1. Possible reasons for the observed effects are discussed below. Manganese Dissolution. The observed fading prompted us to investigate Mn2+ dissolution from the active materials following a potential disproportionation of Mn3+ into Mn2+ and Mn4+.30,43,44 Calculations on the hypothetical amount of manganese in the electrolyte, assuming that capacity fading is only due to manganese dissolution, show that the respective values (∼10−20 ppm) are significantly above the detection limits for ICP, AAS, and EDS. However, neither ICP, nor AAS, nor EDS measurements of the processed and concentrated electrolyte were able to detect dissolved manganese. The Mn detection limit for these methods is ∼1 ppm, so that the amount of dissolved Mn (if any) is <1 ppm. Consequently, a capacity fading of ≥1% should be detectable by these methods if it were resulting from Mn dissolution. Thus, it can be concluded that manganese dissolution has a negligible effect on capacity fading of the P2-type materials presented in this work and cannot explain the differences between the respective materials. Structural Studies. In the following sections, the structural processes as a further cause of the different cycling performances are investigated. NMO Flakes. During discharge (3.8 V−1.5 V), the Na+ content (x) increased from 0.46 to 0.98. The (002) reflection shifts to a higher angle, reflecting a contraction of the unit cell along the c-lattice parameter (Figure 3a). As Na+ inserts between the MnO6 layers, the negative charges of the oxygen between different layers are screened, which moves the layers closer together. The shift of the (010) reflection to lower angles reflects an expansion of the unit cell along the aand bdirections (Figure 3b). The cause of this is a decrease of the oxidation state of manganese during discharge, which results in an expansion of the MnO6-octahedra and, therefore, an expansion of the aand b-lattice parameters.18,22 Two different phases can be observed during discharge. Initially, the hexagonal P2-type phase of the pristine material is maintained up to a Na+ loading of ∼0.87. Then, new reflections occur in the pattern (at 2θ° = 21.3, 23.6, 26.2, 29.6, 37.8, 38.9, 43.1, 45.0; see Figure 4; minor impurity from hydrated phase45,46) and become more intense until the end of the discharge at 1.5 V. Moreover, an overlap of a reflection from the original pattern with a reflection from the newly emerging phase is detectable (2θ° ≈10.2). These new reflections are in line with an orthorhombic phase. Typically, this phase is called the P′2 phase.13,18,47 In Figure 3a the c-lattice parameter development of the initial P2 and the evolving P′2 phase is displayed (Table S2 shows aand b-lattice parameters of P′2). Figure 5a shows the diffraction pattern of the NMO flakes at 1.5 V, as well as the simulated pattern for both the initial hexagonal phase and of the newly formed orthorhombic phase (Cmcm space group). The new reflections in the pattern fit well with the orthorhombic phase. Other reflections that occur at similar positions for both the new orthorhombic and the initial hexagonal phase show a broadening of the reflections in the diffraction pattern due to an overlap of the reflections from the two phases. This phase transition is attributed to the increased amount of Jahn−Teller active Mn3+ in its d4 high-spin configuration. The resulting distortion leads to a transformation of the hexagonal to the orthorhombic unit cell. In the subsequent charge process, the P′2 phase disappears.47 To check whether the phase change is partially irreversible, the NMO flakes|Na-half cell was cycled offline, and the diffraction Figure 2. (a) Discharge profiles of NMO flakes and spheres and NCO flakes and spheres for galvanostatic cycling at 20 mA g−1, (b) cycling stability for cycling at 50 mA g−1, (c) rate test (current rates in mA g−1). Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2044 patterns at OCV were measured after 5, 10, and 15 cycles. However, no remnant of the P′2 phase could be identified. Thus, it is concluded that the phase transformation is reversible. NCO Flakes. The Na+ content changes from 0.49 to 1.0 during discharge. Developments of the lattice parameters are similar to NMO flakes (Figure 3a,b). The c-lattice parameters decrease by 0.11 Å, and the a/b-lattice parameters increase by 0.08 Å. This is also reflected in the unit cell volume, which, for both materials, increases by ∼4 Å3 (4.5%) over the course of the full discharge (Figure 3c). However, during discharge, no new phase could be detected even though the amount of inserted Na+ was similar to NMO flakes (Figure 6). In contrast to high-spin Mn3+, which distorts the structure, Co3+ is Jahn− Figure 3. First discharge (after an initial charge process). Development of the (a) c-lattice parameter of NMO flakes, the evolving P′2 phase for NMO flakes, NCO flakes, and NCO spheres; (b) development of the a/b-lattice parameter of NMO and NCO flakes and NCO spheres; (c) development of the unit cell volume of NMO and NCO flakes and NCO spheres. The two-phase region for the NMO flakes is indicated. In this two-phase region lattice parameters are only shown when they could be clearly distinguished. Figure 4.

This suggests that substituting manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% has a stabilizing effect. Moreover, as shown in the Electrochemical Studies, Co suppresses Na+ ordering processes in the structure, which otherwise occur for the undoped material. These two effects eliminate structural heterogeneity that inherently occurs as the result of repeated structural transformations. The suppression of these phase transitions is suggested to be the reason for the enhanced cycling stability of the NCO flakes over the NMO flakes. NCO Spheres. In order to examine whether morphology has an influence on these transitions, spherical NCO, for which no phase transition is anticipated due to the suppression of transitions by Co-doping, is discussed here. During discharge from 3.8−1.5 V, Na+ content was increased over a wider range: from 0.43 to 1.05. As can be seen in Figure 7, similar to NCO flakes, no phase change occurs. Thus, the difference in cycling stability between the flakes and spheres cannot be the consequence of phase transitions. While the change of the clattice parameter is similar to that of the NCO flakes, the blattice parameter, and therefore also the unit cell volume, changes less severely (Figure 3). Thus, the stress on the crystal structure is reduced as compared to the flakes and the volume expansion of the spheres (∼2.3%) while discharging from 3.8− 1.5 V is only half the volume change of the flakes (∼4.8%). The effect on the structure is exacerbated by the anisotropic expansion of the lattice parameters. As the c-lattice parameter decreases during Na+ insertion, the expansion of the unit cell volume is based on an increase of the aand b-lattice parameter, i.e., an expansion within the plane of MnO6-octahedra. This difference might be one contributing factor to the superior cycling stability of spheres over flakes and could be the cause of the difference in the preservation of morphology over the course of cycling described previously.35 Comparison of Strain Distribution. For undoped materials, the phase change giving rise to additional overlapping reflections makes detailed comparison of the structures difficult. However, given there is no phase transition at high Na+ content for Co-doped materials we can directly compare NCO spheres and NCO flakes. As described above, the volume change is greater for the flakes. Despite the ability to accommodate a slightly larger amount of Na+ in the structure of the NCO spheres (1.05 Na+ for NCO spheres compared to 1.00 Na+ for NCO flakes), the shift in the (002) reflection to higher 2θ° angles for NCO spheres is particularly modest. While one may not be able to infer much from the contraction along the cdirection, observable differences in the FWHM are apparent for the (002) and (004) reflection for the NCO spheres as detailed in Table S3. Here we look at the relative ratio of FWHM(004)/ FWHM(002). For the NCO flakes, while there is no appreciable change in the ratio (within the error) when increasing the Na+ content from 0.6 (OCV) to 1.0, there is a modest observable variation at a low sodium content of 0.49 Na+ (FWHM(004)/ FWHM(002) = 1.18). This possibly indicates a larger distribution of strain in the material. The ratio FWHM(004)/FWHM(002) is larger for NCO spheres. While it is ∼1 around OCV (0.5−0.6 Na+), it is >1 when moving away from OCV in either direction, i.e., for Na+ < 0.5 and Na+ > 0.6. This suggests that although there is a lesser volume change for the spheres, a greater degree of strain distribution in the material is present at high and low Na+ loading, implying possible inhomogeneities in the distribution of Na+ concentration throughout the material. While the mechanism by which this takes place is unclear, it is postulated that this ability to accommodate strain rather than release it in the form of lattice expansion may have two effects: (i) protect the material from structural fatigue during successive cycling leading to superior cycling stability and (ii) facilitate the broader range of sodium content. While it is not possible to observe such differences in the FWHM for NMO spheres for the aforementioned reasons, given the similar performance of the materials it is hypothesized that the same strain accommodation ability may also be one of the reasons for superior cycling stability and capacity of NMO spheres as compared to flakes. NMO Spheres. Na+ content increases from 0.35 to 1.02 during discharge. The development of the diffraction patterns of NMO spheres shows three different phases in the course of one discharge (Figure 8). In the charged state, i.e., at Na+ contents between 0.35−0.49, the diffraction pattern shows a two phase region with reflections from a nonhexagonal phase. From a Na+ loading of 0.82, new reflections (2θ° ≈20.8, 36.3, 37.8, 42.3) and a broadening of the (010) reflection at 2θ° ≈ 22.5 are observed. Moreover, a significant broadening of the (002) reflection (2θ° ≈10.3) at the end of the discharge is visible. The reflections at low sodium content are attributed to a so-called “Z” phase, which represents a structure in which, based on the initial P2-type structure, the layers of MnO6octahedra are shifted.18,47 Even though in some publications an OP4 phase is reported,8,21 Talaie et al. modeled this newly emerging phase with an O2 2 × 2 × 10 supercell, in which the position of the respective layers was randomized.18 According Figure 6. Pattern development for NCO flakes (synchrotron radiation: λ = 0.974 Å, * denote aluminum reflections). Figure 7. Pattern development for NCO spheres (synchrotron radiation: λ = 0.974 Å, * denotes aluminum reflections). Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2046 to Mortemard de Boisse et al., this phase with its lack of longrange order for the MO2 constituents is most suitably called “Z” phase.47 This phase, however, disappeared during discharge. From a Na+ content of 0.49, only the initial P2-stacking order is detectable. In Figure S3a the c-lattice of the original P2 and the “Z” phase of the NMO spheres are shown. In the two phase region, i.e., at a low Na+ content, the c-lattice of the P2 phase stays rather constant. With the disappearance of the “Z” phase the c-lattice of the P2 phase increases until the electrostatic interaction between Na+ and the Mn−O layers results in a decrease of the interlayer distance. Over the development of the single P2 phase region, the a/b-lattice parameter does not change significantly, leading to a smaller volume change of the NMO spheres compared to NMO flakes (Figure S3b,c). The occurrence of the P′2 phase is not as clear as for the NMO flakes. The new reflections at 20.8 and 42.3 as well as the broadening around 10.3 2θ° could indicate the P′2 phase. However, a new reflection at 2θ° ≈36.8 is not in line with an emerging P′2 phase, which suggests that another new phase is formed. Moreover, the prominent reflections between 2θ° = 23−30, which are indicative of a unit cell with the Cmcm space group, are absent. This suggests that the contribution from the P′2 phase is small. Occasionally, impurities from differences in the MnO2 stacking can occur during synthesis. Nevertheless, a comparison of the newly emerging reflections with the patterns of the related layered P3, O3, and O′3 phase showed that these phases do not explain the new reflections.33,48 A structure that could explain the unidentified reflection at 36 2θ°, and also the aforementioned reflections at 21 and 42 2θ°, is cubic Na3MnO4 (space group P213). Although this structure is not in line with the layered oxide structure, the precursor for our spherical P2type NMO was amorphous MnO2, which, at synthesis temperature, is converted to Mn2O3 which crystallizes in a cubic structure. Thus, a minor part of the Mn2O3 precursor might not have been transformed to P2-type NMO during the annealing process and has taken up Na+ at potentials of 2.2−1.5 Figure 8.

For the undoped materials the two phase regions are indicated. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2047 V vs Na|Na+, possibly resulting in the detectable presence of this phase. A shoulder at 2θ° = 20.6, where Mn2O3 has its most intense reflection, supports this hypothesis. The mechanism for this transformation and the concomitant change in the Mn:O ratio, however, is still unclear. There may have been unreacted amorphous MnOx that can have crystallized. Figure 5b shows the diffraction pattern of the NMO spheres at OCV and at 1.5 V, as well as simulated patterns of the initial P2 phase, and of the potentially formed P′2 phase and cubic P213 space group. Sharma et al. recently showed that, even for the same material, the formation of the P′2 phase depends on the current rate at which the material is cycled, i.e., on kinetic factors.49 These factors could be influenced by stacking faults or defects in the structure. Different tendencies for NMO flakes and spheres to form the P′2 phase could therefore be attributed to different kinetic behavior, such as nucleation of the new phase. The smaller changes in the unit cell volume of the spheres, in combination with the lower concentration of the P′2 phase throughout cycling, reduce structural stresses and fatigue. These effects are considered to be the leading contributors to the observed higher cycling stability of the materials with spherical morphology. The NCO spheres do not show the impurity attributed to the Mn2O3 precursor. Moreover, the Co-doped materials have a larger average crystallite size than the undoped analogues, as indicated by sharper reflections in the XRD pattern. This is in line with findings by Paulsen et al. that incorporating Co into the structure can facilitate the formation of the P2 phase during synthesis.28 Thus, the Co-doped materials are anticipated to contain a lower degree of amorphous/untransformed material, which can crystallize in the suspected cubic phase. In our measurements, the “Z” phase was not observed for low Na+ contents for the NCO spheres. However, Na+ content during the initial charge might just not have been decreased sufficiently to induce the formation of the “Z” phase. Diffusion and Conductivity Properties. Filling up a given structure with Na+ influences the mobility of these Naions and, thus, affects diffusion properties. As structural changes result in different pathways along which Na+ can move in the structure, phase transitions also have an effect on diffusion. To elucidate these changes, GITT and in situ EIS were performed. Figure 9 shows the development of the effective diffusion coefficients for all materials during the course of one discharge as measured by GITT. Minima of the diffusion coefficient are indicative of the exhaustion of certain processes or structural rearrangements.50 Between a Na+ content of 0.45 and 0.67, i.e., the solid solution region, diffusion coefficients are comparable, and develop in parallel, for all materials. The diffusion coefficient is between 10−9−10−10 cm2 s−1, which is considered to indicate fast diffusion processes for an insertion material. Minor changes (i.e., minima) can be observed in this region for undoped NMO flakes (Figure 9a) and spheres (Figure 9c), which correlate well with small plateaus in the discharge curve that signify Na+ ordering processes (Figure 2a). At a Na+ content of ∼0.67, diffusion coefficients for all materials start decreasing. For Na+ contents beyond that, the values diverge. NMO flakes show a local minimum at a Na+ content of ∼0.77 (DNa+ ≈10−12 cm2 s−1), followed by an increase and, subsequently, another minimum (DNa+ ≈10−13 cm2 s−1). Both the electrochemistry and GITT measurements suggest the start of a first structural transition at a Na+ content of ∼0.7. The diffraction data, however, did not show any phase change in this region (Figure 4). This minimum can be explained by a high concentration overpotential, which results in a rearrangement of the Na-ions between the MnO6-layers and thus in changes of the diffusion properties. The second minimum at x = 0.97 is attributed to the phase transition toward the orthorhombic phase as observed by synchrotron XRD (Figures 4 and 5a). GITT measurements suggest the phase transition takes place at a slightly higher Na+ content than indicated by XRD. This difference can possibly be attributed to the nature of the GITT analysis. For the calculation of the Na+ content, only the Na+ insertion induced by the applied current is considered, while minor deviations from the typical galvanostatic behavior have been observed for this method before.47,50,51 Slower relaxation times during the major plateau at ∼2.2−2.1 V as compared to the solid solution region (e.g., ∼2.9 V) are attributed to a decrease of electric and/or ionic conductivity (Figure S4). Except for this second minimum at high Na+ contents, NCO flakes (Figure 9b) show the same trend as NMO flakes, i.e., the same position for the main minima and maxima, albeit at considerable higher values for the diffusion coefficient (DNa+ ≈ 10−12 cm2 s−1 for the minimum). This increase is attributed to the effect of the Co. For NMO spheres (Figure 9c) the trend is similar to the NMO flakes. However, the structural transition at ∼0.7 starts at a minimum value of DNa+ ≈10−10 cm2 s−1, followed by a decrease to lower values for the diffusion coefficient (DNa+ ≈10−12 cm2 s−1) at a Na+ content of x ≈0.88. Moreover, a third minimum occurs at a Na+ content of ∼1.02. The diffusion coefficient of the last minimum is comparable to the minimum of the NMO flakes which was attributed to the phase transition toward the P′2 phase. This substantiates the hypothesis of a phase transition from the hexagonal P63/mmc to the orthorhombic Cmcm phase discussed in the section on Structural Studies. The minimum which indicates the phase transition toward an orthorhombic phase for both NMO materials can be seen neither for the Co-doped flakes nor spheres. This is in line with suppression of the phase transition as concluded in the Structural Studies section. Over the whole P2 phase region both NCO flakes and spheres exhibit higher diffusion coefficients than the undoped analogues. This is explained by enhancement of the Na+ conductivity as a result of Co-doping. This higher conductivity is also reflected in the rate capability, which is better for the Co-doped materials (Figure 2c). The reason for the lower conductivity of the undoped material is attributed to the high resistivity induced by the Mn3+, which, in its d4 high-spin configuration, is a Jahn−Teller active ion and has more localized electrons to interact with the positively charged sodium.52,53 For LiMnO2, doping results in a suppression of the Jahn−Teller effect, which lowers the diffusion barrier and thus increases ionic conductivity.54 A similar effect is assumed here. Moreover, the suppression of the Na+ ordering may further facilitate the Na+ transport between the layers. These findings have been confirmed by EIS (Table S5 and Figure S5) in a three-electrode setup for NMO and NCO flakes at various potentials. Even though the trend for the chargetransfer resistance is similar in the beginning, i.e., in the first charge and the first part of the subsequent discharge, the values for NMO flakes and NCO flakes diverge at approximately 2.5 V, shortly before the onset of the pronounced plateau. In the plateau, while there are no phase transitions osidbserved in the XRD, the increase of charge transfer resistance of NMO is one order of magnitude larger than the respective value for NCO flakes. This provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that the stabilizing effect of Co is not limited to Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041−2051 2048 structural stabilization but can also improve cycling stability through enhanced ionic conductivity in the electrode. ■CONCLUSION P2-type NaxMnO2 and NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2 were synthesized in two different morphologies, hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres. Their structural and diffusion properties in the context of sodium-ion battery cathodes were investigated using in operando synchrotron XRD, GITT, and in situ EIS. In addition, dissolved manganese could not be detected in the electrolyte for NMO flakes over the course of cycling and is therefore thought to play a negligible role. P2-NaxMnO2 flakes undergo partial phase transition toward an orthorhombic crystal system upon the insertion of Na+, while Co-doping on the order of 10% suppresses these structural transformations. The lack of repeated phase transitions might reduce inhomogeneity in the structure and, together with the suppression of Na+ ordering processes, explain the better cycling stability of the doped material. In addition to the beneficial structural effects, Codoping is also shown to have a positive influence on Na-ion transport within the structure. This not only explains the better rate capability of doped vs undoped materials but could also contribute toward improved cycling stability. Superior cycling stability of hollow spheres as compared to flakes is attributed to the reduced volume expansion and contraction for the spheres. Thus, increased strain within the structure of the spheres is one explanation for this difference. Moreover, the spherical material shows a higher capacity, which is attributed to structural defects. The effects of Co-doping are different from the intended effect for other transition metals. Incorporating elements such as Ni or Fe into the structure aims at increasing energy density by exploiting the high potential of their respective redox reactions. In addition, Yabuuchi et al. showed that incorporating 50% of Fe into the structure increases cycling stability by suppressing Na+ ordering processes;8 however, Fe does not prevent phase transformation in the lower voltage region.18,22,47 Ni-substitution, on the other hand, does not eliminate Na+ ordering processes but enhances structural stability by alleviating the Jahn−Teller distortion and delaying the phase transitions between 2.1−1.5 V.21,24,27,46 Incorporating a relatively small amount of Coas low as 10%into the structure enhances Na+ conductivity, suppresses Na+ ordering, and prevents phase transformation between 2.1− 1.5 V and thus allows a more reversible exploitation of the capacity that can be obtained in this voltage region. A combined approach of the two presented material optimization routes, i.e., doping and morphology optimization, has been shown to be most successful in attaining superior capacity and cycling stability for the investigated materials. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557.

By electrochemically extracting Li from a monoclinic layered Li2MnO3, we prepared Li2−xMnO3 (x = 1.6-1.8) of which the Li-extracted domain has a cubic spinel structure. The reversible discharge and charge capacity of Li2−xMnO3 versus the Na negative electrode initially exceeded 200 mA · h · g−1, suggesting that close to one molar equivalent of Na is inserted in and extracted from the formula unit, Li2−xMnO3. The electrode retains the capacity of 160 mA · h · g−1 after 50 cycles. On the other hand, the Li2−xMnO3 electrode versus the Li negative electrode significantly degrades upon cycling. The ex-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the spinel domain of Li2−xMnO3 retains its crystallographic structure during the Na insertion and extraction, although the crystal significantly loses its periodicity when Na is inserted. A numerical simulation of the SR-XRD profile suggests that the Na-inserted Li2−xMnO3 has the periodicity of only one to two unit cells while retaining the spinel structure. XAS revealed that the reversible capacity is found to be dominated by the redox between Mn(III) and Mn(IV) and the Mn-Mn distance significantly loses its correlation upon Na-insertion, which is consistent with the broad SR-XRD profile. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Sodium containing Mn-based oxides have become the focus of attraction as a positive electrode material for the sodium ion battery since manganese is an abundant resource and can be considered a low-cost material [1–4]. For example, ̨-NaMnO2 with the monoclinic structure and P2-type Na0.6MnO2 with the hexagonal layered structure, have high initial reversible capacities of more than 180 and 150 mA · h · g−1, respectively [5,6]. With the reversible capacity of only 90 mA · h · g−1 notwithstanding, Na0.44MnO2 with a tunneltype structure undergoes many cycles [7]. When Li is inserted in and extracted from lithium manganese oxides (e.g., LiMn2O4, LiMnO2, etc.), the Mn3+ ⇌Mn4+ redox is often accompanied by a crystallographic phase transition, resulting in a poor cycle stability [8]. A monoclinic layered oxide, Li2MnO3, is not an exception; namely, although the initial discharge capacity exceeds 250 mA · h · g−1, the material suffers from a significant degradation upon cycling caused by the transition into a cubic ∗Corresponding author.

On the other hand, the energetic barrier for such a transition is said to be much higher in the case of Na insertion and extraction [10]. If we can reversibly sodiate and desodiate Li2−xMnO3 suppressing its crystallographic transition, we would be able to achieve a high capacity and long cycle-life electrode material for the sodium ion battery. The reaction mechanism and stoichiometry of Li2MnO3 to explain its high reversible capacity is not yet clear and still a controversy. For the discussion below, we now mention some presumable reactions, where A typically stands for Li or an alkaline metal, in general. The initial oxidation reaction is allegedly accompanied by oxygen release [11–13], which could be written as, in a complete hypothetical stoichiometry, A2MnIVO3 −→A+ + e−+ MnIVO2 + 1 2 O2. (1) During the subsequent A-reinsertion, the released oxygen is considered to be hardly resumed. The following redox of Mn would be dominant: MnIVO2 + A+ + e−←−AMnIIIO2.

Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 459 In the present study, we prepared Li2−xMnO3 by electrochemically extracting Li from Li2MnO3. The electrochemical properties of Li2−xMnO3 were evaluated in a half-cell setup in which Na metal was used as the counter electrode. The crystallographic structure was investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an electron energy-loss spectrometer (EELS). The chemical state and local structure were examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Broad humps in the SR-XRD profile of the sodiated Li2−xMnO3 were numerically simulated to confirm its spinel structure. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Sample preparation A layered manganese oxide, Li2MnO3, as the starting material in this study was prepared by the solid-state reaction between Li2CO3 (Kishida Chemical, purity 98%) and Mn2O3 (Aldrich, purity 99.9%). Li2CO3 and Mn2O3 were mixed by ball-milling in air at the molar ratio of 2:1 for the target composition to be Li:Mn = 2:1. The mixture was calcined in a gold crucible in air for 10 h at 800 ◦C at which we obtained the best qualified Li2MnO3 sample in the examined temperature range from 400 to 1000 ◦C. The Li-extracted sample, Li2−xMnO3, was prepared by electrochemically extracting lithium from the Li2MnO3 as follows (see the next subsection for the electrochemical cell assembly). A Li2MnO3/Li cell was first galvanostatically charged (i.e., Li extracted or delithiated) to 4.95 V vs. Li+/Li at the current density of 10 mA · g−1, then potentiostatically charged until the total amount of the charge reached 460 mA · h · g−1. The Li2−xMnO3 electrode, removed from the cell, was rinsed several times with dimethyl carbonate and then reassembled into a Li2−xMnO3/Na cell. The cell was galvanostatically discharged (i.e., Na inserted or sodiated) to 1.5 V vs. Na+/Na at the current density of 10 mA · g−1. 2.2. Electrochemical properties The electrode was prepared by attaching a mixture of the active material (84 wt.%), acetylene black (AB; 8 wt.%) as the conductive additive and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; 8 wt.%) as the binder to an aluminum mesh. The total mass of the active material per electrode was about 7-8 mg. Throughout the present study, the electrochemical capacity was expressed in terms of per initial mass of Li2MnO3. The electrode was tested in an IEC R2032 coin-type cell assembled with a sodium or lithium foil counter electrode, a separator (Celgard 2400) and the electrolyte (1 mol · L−1 of LiPF6 or NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate, EC/DEC (1:1 volume ratio). On initial sodiation process, the cell was galvanostatically discharged (i.e., Na inserted or sodiated) at the current density of 10 mA · g−1, until the potential reached 1.5 V vs. Na+/Na, at which it was then potentiostatically discharged until the current density dropped to 1 mA · g−1. Following process, the cell was galvanostatically charged and discharged at the current density of 10mA · g−1. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were evaluated using a battery testing system (BLS series, Keisokuki Center). 2.3. Material characterization The crystallographic structures of the samples were characterized by a laboratory X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku RINT Cu K ̨) and by synchrotron radiation XRD (SR-XRD, SPring-8, BL19B2). For the SR-XRD, the samples were placed in a glass capillary with a 0.5 mm outer diameter. The data were collected using a DebyeScherrer camera with an imaging plate. The wavelength of the X-ray was calibrated to \u0002/nm = 0.06995 using CeO2 as the standard material. The diffraction angle, 2\u0003, ranged from 5.00 to 78.00◦, for which one scan took 300 s. The precise crystallographic structures of the samples were determined by the Rietveld refinements of the SR-XRD data using the RIETAN-FP program [14]. The molar ratio of Na to Mn (Na/Mn) was evaluated by an inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. The local structure and valence shift of the Mn ion were evaluated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, Rits, BL3). The morphology of the sample powders was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6390 JEOL) and the distribution of the constituent elements was detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The nano structure of the sample powders was observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, 3000F, JEOL) equipped with an electron energy-loss spectrometer (EELS), by which the chemical state of the elements was measured. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Precursor Li2MnO3 The XRD profile of the precursor, Fig. 1, is quite consistent with that simulated for the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase (PDF #01-0841634, space group C2/m). The profile is free of impurity signals, evidence for a successful synthesis. One finds from the SEM image inset in Fig. 1 that the Li2MnO3 sample is comprised of a mixture of spherical and hexagonal particles of ∼300 nm diameter. 3.2. Sodiation of Li2−xMnO3 Fig. 2 shows the electrochemical potential profiles during the initial charge (i.e., delithiation) process of the Li2MnO3/Li cell and during the subsequent discharge (i.e., sodiation) of the Li2−xMnO3/Na cell. This result is compared to that during the discharge process of the Li2−xMnO3/Li cell (i.e., lithiation). The lower abscissa indicates the electrochemical capacity in terms of mA · h · g−1 and the upper one is converted to the molar equivalent (mol eq) of Li or Na in the Li2−xMnO3 by assuming that the observed capacity would purely result from the alkali metal extraction and insertion; namely, 460 mA · h · g−1 corresponds to 2.0 mol eq. The left hand-side ordinate indicates the potential difference referenced to Li metal and the right hand-side one to Na metal, in which the numerals of the latter are shifted +0.3 from the former in order to reflect the difference in the standard redox potentials of these metals; i.e., −3.0 and −2.7 V vs. NHE for Li and Na, respectively. During the initial delithiation, a potential plateau is observed at around 4.5 V vs. Li+/Li which corresponds to the oxygen release [12]. When the charge capacity of Li2MnO3 reaches 460 mA · h · g−1, Fig. 1. XRD profile and a SEM image of the as-prepared Li2MnO3 precursor. (X-ray: Cu K ̨) 460 R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 Fig. 2. Electrochemical potential profiles of the Li2MnO3 electrode during the initial delithiation (solid line) and the subsequent sodiation (dashed line) or lithiation (solid line). the electrode potential rises to 4.9 V vs. Li+/Li. During the subsequent sodiation, Li2−xMnO3 is capable of inserting 0.99 mol eq of Na ions (or 238 mA · h · g−1). The fact that the capacity of the lithiation exceeds that of the sodiation and the potential of the former is higher than that of the latter even if taking into account the 0.3 V difference in the redox potentials of Li and Na implies that Li+ is more easily inserted into Li2−xMnO3 than Na+, probably due to the smaller ionic radius of the former (0.076 nm) than the latter (0.102 nm). The ICP measurement suggests that 0.96 mol eq of Na is contained in the sodiated Li2−xMnO3, which is consistent with the electrochemical capacity observed during the sodiation. However, the ICP measurement also detected 0.2-0.4 mol eq of Li residing in the Li2−xMnO3 both before and after the sodiation (i.e., x = 1.6 −1.8), which is at odds with the initial delithiation capacity. We suspect that certain side reactions, such as the decomposition of the electrolyte at a higher potential, may be involved in the initial delithiation process. The residual Li-containing phase is also detected by TEM and SR-XRD as shown below. As for the structure of the sodiated Li2−xMnO3, see the “TEM and EELS observation” and its subsequent sections. 3.3. Electrode performance Fig. 3 compares the charge and discharge profiles of the cells, Li2−xMnO3/Li (LMO) and Li2−xMnO3/Na (NMO). Initially, the reversible capacity of the LMO exceeds that of the NMO. However, after more than 30 cycles, the capacity of the NMO surpasses that of the LMO. The slope of the charge and discharge profiles of the LMO becomes steeper than that of the NMO upon cycling, especially above 3.5 V vs. Li+/Li or 3.2 V vs. Na+/Na, implying more serious damage in the LMO than in the NMO. The cycle trends in the discharge capacity of the LMO and NMO are compared in Fig. 4. The potential range of the cycle test was set to 2.5-4.5 V vs. Li+/Li for the LMO and 1.5-4.2 V vs. Na+/Na for the NMO, so that the first discharge capacities of both the LMO and NMO are around 250 mA · h · g−1. Although the LMO enjoys a higher capacity than the NMO during the initial ten cycles, its capacity significantly decays to less than 100 mA · h · g−1 in the following ten cycles. On the other hand, the NMO retains about 85% of the second discharge capacity observed during the second cycle after 50cycles, i.e.„ 160 mA · h · g−1. Fig. 3. Charge and discharge profiles of the Li2−xMnO3-electrodes versus (a) Li (LMO) and (b) Na (NMO). The coulombic efficiency of the NMO maintains more than 9899% after a few initial cycles, while that of the LMO drops to less than 90%. This suggests that the large structural distortion due to the Mn migration during the cycling is severer for Li insertion and extraction than for Na. 3.4. TEM and EELS analyses Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) Li2−xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2−xMnO3. The high crystallinity of the Fig. 4. Cycle trends in the discharge capacity of the Li2−xMnO3-electrodes using Li (LMO) and Na (NMO) as the counter electrode. R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 461 Fig. 5. TEM observation of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) Li2−xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2−xMnO3. Top: real-space images, Middle: diffraction patterns from a domain in which residual Li was observed after delithiation and Bottom: diffraction patterns from a domain which was completely delithiated. as-prepared Li2MnO3 is reflected in its fine diffraction spots, which are well assigned to the space group C2/m, consistent with Fig. 1. In the particles after the delithiation, Li2−xMnO3, Fig. 5(b), we found two domains distinguishable by their diffraction patterns, one of which is attributable to the zone axis [112] of the spinel structure (space group Fd ̄3m), Fig. 5(b-1), and the other to [001] of C2/m, Fig. 5(b-2). The spinel domain should be the unreacted Li2MnO3 since the inter-planar spacing calculated from the diffraction spots coincides with that from the electron diffraction simulated from the structural model of Li2MnO3 [15]. The Fd ̄3m domain is considered to be the reacted (i.e., delithiated) phase which has a spinel structure, i.e., \u0002-MnO2. The presence of the Li residue is consistent with the ICP measurement mentioned in the section “Sodiation of Li2−xMnO3”. The arrangement of the oxygen atoms in the [112] plane of Fd ̄3m resembles that in the [001] plane of C2/m, suggesting that the interface between these two phases is coherent [16]. After the sodiation, Fig. 5(c), while the unreacted C2/m phase retains its space group and lattice constant intact, the diffraction spots from the Fd ̄3m domain significantly change. The following detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that this sodiated domain is not a layered structure, but remains to be a spinel structure, although it may be tetragonally distorted. The six diffraction spots marked with circles in Fig. 5(c-2) nearly form a regular hexagon, giving the inter-planar distance (d-spacing) of 0.149-0.152 nm. Were the sodiated domain the layered structure of C2/m space group, i.e., layered ̨-NaMnO2, Fig. 5(c-2) should be along the zone axis [001] and the six spots should correspond to the Miller indices of ± 2 ±2 0 and ±4 0 0, respectively. However, the experimentally observed d-spacing of layered ̨-NaMnO2 of these planes is 0.13 nm [22], which is inconsistent with the present result. In other words, in order for the corresponding d-spacing of the layered structure to be 0.149-0.152 nm, the Mn-O distance should be 0.22-0.26 nm, which is unlikely long by considering their Shannon radii. Another possibility is that the sodiated domain remains to be a spinel. If the six spots precisely form a regular hexagon, the phase is a cubic spinel (e.g., Fd ̄3m), while if it is irregular, the phase is considered tetragonally distorted (e.g., I41/amd). The blur spots, however, do not allow us to decisively state that the 3% difference between 0.149 and 0.152 nm is significant. We proceed the analysis by adopting the lower-symmetry space group of I41/amd, which is consistent with the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn(III). In this interpretation, Fig. 5(c-2) is considered along the zone axis [201] of I41/amd and the Miller indices of the six spots correspond to 040, 0 ̄40, 22 ̄4, ̄2 ̄24, 2 ̄2 ̄4 and ̄224 respectively, yielding the lattice constants a/nm=0.595 and c/nm = 0.8671. Incidentally, the 3% of distortion of the present material, if any, is smaller than that of Li2MnIII 2 O4 (7%), for which we suspect the reason is that the defects in the Mn site observed by EELS below absorb the Jahn-Teller distortion. By the sodiation, the lattice of the spinel phase expands by 18% in the volume which is much larger than that of other Na inserting materials with layered structures [17]. Therefore, we consider that the spinel to layer transition of \u0002-MnO2 has not occurred during sodiation in this study. Fig. 6 shows the electron energy loss spectra (EELS) of (a) the delithiated (reacted) domain in Li2−xMnO3 and (b) the sodiated domain after the sodiation of Li2−xMnO3. The spectra from the unreacted Li-residing domains (not shown) were used as a reference of Li2MnO3. The binding energy of the Na L-edge, ca. 38 eV, is reflected in the increase in the shoulder over the background after the sodiation. A small peak at around ca. 38 eV in Fig. 6(b), which corresponds 462 R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 Fig. 6. EELS spectra of (a) delithiated domain in Li2−xMnO3 and (b) sodiated domain after sodiation of Li2−xMnO3. to the binding energy of the Li L-edge, may imply the presence of Li in the sodiated domain as well. However, EELS detects the signal from several tens nanometers region, so that the profile may contain the signal from the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain. While no shift was observed in the oxygen K-edge, the manganese L-edge shifted to a lower binding energy after the sodiation, reflecting the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ as in reaction (2). The molar ratios of oxygen to manganese (O/Mn) was semiquantitatively evaluated by comparing the peak areas of the O K-edge and Mn L-edge for each of which the integration ranges were from 550 to 555 eV and from 635 to 670 eV, respectively. To cancel out the intensity drift, the two signals (O K and Mn L) were simultaneously recorded. Normalizing the peak area ratio observed in the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain to 3.0, we found O/Mn to be 2.4-2.5 in the delithiated domain of Li2−xMnO3; i.e., the initial delithiation is accompanied by 0.5-0.6 mol eq of the release oxygen (cf. the reaction (1)) [16]. The O/Mn ratio after sodiation is 2.5-2.7 in the reacted domain, which barely shifted from that before the sodiation. The oxygen uptake reported by Tabuchi et al. [21] during the lithiation of Li1+x(Fe0.25Mn0.75)O2 was not observed1. The fact that O/Mn ratio exceeds 2.0 suggests the Mn sites in the reacting domain abound in defects. These Mn defects might have prohibited the spinel phase from returning to the layered structure in contrast to what is observed by Yabuuchi et al. [23] in which a partial transition from spinel to layer is reported in a Na cell using LiMn2O4. 3.5. Synchrotron XRD The crystallographic change before and after the sodiation was investigated using ex-situ SR-XRD. Fig. 7 shows the SR-XRD patterns of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) delithiated Li2−xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2−xMnO3. The initial sharp peaks of the as-prepared Li2MnO3 belong to the C2/m transitions to the Fd ̄3m spinel structure, so called \u0002-MnO2, with a slight broadening of the peaks after the delithiation. The peak broadening would ascribed to the structural distortion of \u0002-MnO2 since the O/Mn ratio of Li2−xMnO3 is estimated to be more than 2.0 indicating that there has some defects in the Mn site of \u0002-MnO2 structure. One also notices that a small amount of unreacted Li2MnO3 remains after the delithiation. These results agree with our TEM observation. Yan et al. observe a gradual structural change from C2/m to Fd ̄3m during the lithium 1 Strictly speaking, this result stipulates that the chemical formula of Li2−xMnO3 be written as “Li2−xMnOy where y = 2.4 ∼2.6”, etc., which we avoid for simplicity. Fig. 7. SR-XRD patterns of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) delithiated Li2−xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2−xMnO3. (\u0002/nm = 0.06995) extraction and insertion cycling of LiMnO2 [16], which is in contrast to our result of one-step transition to Fd ̄3m through the Li extraction. We speculate that the greater amount of Li extraction during the first charge process in our study than Yan’s (i.e., 460 vs. about 100 mA · h · g−1) invokes the more drastical phase change in the former than in the latter. No peak shift was observed between the as-prepared Li2MnO3 and the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain of Li2−xMnO3, suggesting that the delithiation is biphasic as Yu et al. reported [11]. The mass fraction of the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase in Li2−xMnO3 is evaluated to be about 30 wt.% by the Rietveld refinement of the SR-XRD profile. Assuming the spinel phase to be MnO2, one finds from this mass fraction that the molar ratio of Li to Mn in the entire delithiated sample to be 0.38, which is in good agreement with the ICP measurement (Li / Mn = 0.45). After the sodiation of Li2−xMnO3, very broad humps show up, with the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase remaining. The TEM diffraction spots from the reacted domain (Fig. 5(c)) suggest that the humps stem from the completely sodiated phase, NaMnO2, having the spinel structure, yet its crystalline periodicity is considerably lost. In general, the crystallite size is estimated from the peak widths of the XRD based on the Scherrer equation. However, the humps in Fig. 7(c) are so broad that the equation does not exactly apply. We then directly calculated in the real spaces from the diffraction profile of one crystallite particle without any periodic condition as follows. The intensity, I, of the X-ray (wavelength = \u0002) diffracted at the angle \u0003 from the atoms situated at ⃗ri and ⃗rj is: |I(\u0003)|2 ∝ \u0002 i \u0002 j>i fj(\u0003) exp\u0003 2\u0004i⃗K · \u0004 ⃗rj −⃗ri \u0005\u0006 (3) where fj is the atomic scattering factor of the atom j, and ⃗K is the scattering vector of which the magnitude is: |⃗K| = 2 sin \u0003 \u0002 . (4) Fig. 9 shows the simulated pattern in which superimposed are two profiles of the spinel NaMnO2 with 0.4 and 1.6 nm sizes, or several unit cells. The structure model is given in Fig. 8 and Table 1 with the lattice constant a/nm=0.595 and c/nm = 0.8671 based on the TEM diffraction described above. Note that we don’t consider the presence of the Li ion in the structure. The coordinates of the oxygen atom are fixed based on the EXAFS result (see the next section). The simulated profile well reproduces the experimental result. The delithiated domain of Li2−xMnO3 retains its spinel structure after sodiation, but loses its crystallinity R.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Figs. 10(b) and (c) show the XANES and EXAFS spectra of the Mn K-edge, respectively, taken at the states indicated by the numbers 1-4 in the potential profile, Fig. 10(a). Each state corresponds to (1) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (2) delithiated Li2−xMnO3, (3) sodiated Li2−xMnO3, i.e., NMO and (4) desodiated NMO. The inset in (b) magnifies the pre-edge region, 6530-6546 eV, which reflects the 1s→3d transition. The pre-edge signal of the reduced sample, (3), is observed at (B) 6537 eV, which is lower than the other oxidized samples, i.e., (1), (2) and (3) at (A) 6539 eV. In the case of lithium manganese oxide in general, the shift to the lower binding energy of the Mn pre-edge indicates the reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(III), which Fig. 10.

Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 distorts the initially centro-symmetric MnO6 octahedron due to the Jahn-Teller effect [18,19]. In the present material, the sodiation triggers a similar distortion in the structure, resulting in the broad humps in the SR-XRD profile. Fig 10 (c) shows the radial correlation, \u0005, as a function of the distance from Mn, R, derived from the EXAFS spectra taken at points (2), (3) and (4) in Fig 10(a). The first peak in \u0005 centering at R/nm = 0.15 is attributed to the Mn-O distance. The peak shape does not apparently change after sodiation. The distortion in the MnO6 octahedron after the sodiation inferred from the XANES spectrum may be too subtle to be reflected in the peak shape of \u00052. The second peak in \u0005 at R/nm = 0.2-0.3 corresponds to the Mn-Mn distance. The intensity of this peak significantly decreases during the sodiation, suggesting a significant loss in the crystallographic regularity. This observation is also consistent with the analysis described in the section “SR-XRD”. The Mn-Mn peak intensity increases when the sodiated sample is desodiated again, implying that the regularity is reinstated to some extent. 3.7. Structural change and cycle-life stability When Li2−xMnO3 is cycled in the Li-system, its structure shuttles between the spineland layer-type. During this transition, Mn is prone to migrate from the initial octahedral site to the tetrahedral site, which clogs the Li diffusion in the electrode, resulting in the poor cycle-stability [9]. On the other hand, the present study proved that Li2−xMnO3 retains the spinel structure in the Na-system, although its crystallographic regularity is significantly lost when sodiated. In case of AMnO2, the layer structure is retained during the redox reaction when A = Na, resulting in a good cycle stability [5], whereas a quick degradation is observed when A = Li [20]. Whether the spinelor layer-structure, the poor stability results from the Mn-migration triggered by the structural phase transition. A computational study by Reed et al. indeed suggests that the Mn-migration to the tetrahedral sites is energetically unfavorable compared to the Li counterpart due to the difference in the ionic sizes [10]. The better cycle stability of Li2−xMnO3 in Na than in Li is presumably achieved by preventing the Mn-migration. 4. Conclusion A spinel manganese oxide, Li2−xMnO3, was synthesized by electrochemically extracting Li from Li2MnO3, intending to use it as a positive electrode material for the Na-ion battery. The initial discharge capacity of Li2−xMnO3 exceeded 230 mA · h · g−1, corresponding to more than 1.0 mol eq of Na insertion. The discharge capacity remained more than 80% of that observed for the second cycle after 50 cycles. This cycle-stability is superior to the case when Li2−xMnO3 was used in the Li-system. The TEM observation and SRXRD analysis revealed that the material retained its initial spinel structure during the sodiation and desodiation, although the crystallographic regularity was significantly lost during the sodiation. Whether the structural phase transition takes place or not during the redox reaction can be a key for the long cycle-life.

In this work, we propose an effective strategy by a combination of liquid N2 quenching and aliovalent doping to get new layered cathode materials. As evidenced by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction and solid-state 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the proposed synthesis methods allow tuning the transition metal ions vacancies and enhance Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center of P2-type Mnbased materials. Our results demonstrate that such an optimized structure significantly enhances the deliverable capacity, Naþ mobility and electronic conductivity of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of aliovalent doping elements and different cooling approaches on the long-range structure, local environment and electrochemical performance are comprehensively studied by comparing a wide range of doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4 Li, Mg, Al, Fe) materials. The optimized Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 material exhibits a remarkably high initial capacity of 202 mAh g\u0000 1 among ever reported P2-type layered oxides within 2–4 V, a stable capacity retention of 81% after 600 cycles and outstanding rate capability of the specific capacity up to 122 mAh g\u0000 1 at 1200 mA g\u0000 1. 1. Introduction The rapid development of intelligent and environmental-friendly industrial technology, including smart mobile phone and green elec­ tric vehicles, has made rechargeable batteries an indispensable part of our modern society [1,2]. Among various energy storage systems, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with superior high energy and power den­ sities performance have accounted for the key position [3]. Neverthe­ less, the low reserve and uneven distribution of Li resources, and the use of high-cost and toxicity of Co and Ni as redox center for mostly LIBs cathode materials fail to fulfill demands of sustainable development [4]. Recently, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted many interests and are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact that sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural abundance than lithium [5,6]. In the development of NIBs, cathode is the most critical component that restricts cost and energy density in the full batteries [7,8]. Comparing to polyanionic and tunnel-type cathodes materials for NIBs, layered transition metal oxides (NaxMO2, M 1⁄4 transition metal) are extensively studied because of their high theoretical specific capacity * Corresponding author.

Among them, the low-cost Mn-based layered materials are deemed as ideal cathodes for large-scale energy storage. Two types of stacking structures, O3(ABCABC stacking) and P2(AABB stacking) are frequently observed in most of as-synthesized NaxMnO2 materials within layered structure materials [10]. In comparison to the (de)sodiation of O3-type materials via the interstitial tetrahedral sites with relatively higher hopping energy from one octahedral site to another, the P2-type phase allows a direct migration between adjacent prismatic sites, thus enabling rapid Naþ transport and showing better applicability [11]. However, the available capacities of P2-type cathode materials are still insufficient yet [12,13]. To address this issue, anionic redox reaction is introduced as its Li counterpart, which can be triggered to get extra capacity by charging the cells to a higher voltage range of 4.0–4.5 V vs. Naþ/Na (4.3–4.8 V vs. Liþ/Li). Unfortunately, the cathode materials inevitably suffer from electrolyte decomposition, multiple phase transition and even oxygen loss at such a high voltage, resulting in obvious voltage hysteresis and rapid capacity fade [14–17]. In contrast, controlling the cut-off voltage lower than 4 V for P2-type cathode can effectively eliminate aforementioned shortages and yield a much better cyclability, but the reversible capacity is hardly higher than 175 mAh g\u0000 1 [18–22]. Recent investigations have focused on the optimization of the crys­ talline/local structures and morphology engineering of NaxMnO2 by adjusting the Na/Mn ratio, sintering temperature, cooling rate and aliovalent doping [20–25], which further determine the electrochemical performance. However, the overall performance of the materials is far below our expectation. The understanding of underlying structure-property relationship of the materials, especially the local environment including Mn vacancies, is insufficient for obtaining the material with high capacity and long cycle performance. The formation of Mn vacancies in the transition metal (TM) layers have been observed over 40 years [26–29]. Parant et al. proposed that Na0.67MnO2 is able to uptake oxygen during the cooling process [27], resulting in the lift of Mn ions oxidation state and the formation of manganese deficient phases (denoted as □): Na0.67MnO2 þ y/2 O2 → Na0.67MnO2þy (Na0.67/(1þy/2)Mn1/(1þy/2)□(y/2)/(1þy/ 2)O2) The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of Dahn’s group showed a reversible mass gain and decline which are related to the oxygen uptake and release during cooling and heating, respectively [29]. The above works demonstrated that Mn vacancies are inclined to form during cooling process and then adjust the valence of Mn ions. Moreover, previous work has implied that a high-temperature quench­ ing treatment is possibly conducive to eliminate the Mn vacancies, which was reported by Komaba’s group designing distorted P20-Na0.67MnO2 with higher capacity than undistorted P2–Na0.67MnO2 [30], which represent a reasonable approach to synthesize a high-capacity Mn-based cathode material for NIBs [31–33]. However, such quenched samples still contain high content of Mn3þ ions entailing the notorious Jahn-Teller effect and thus multiphase transition during cycling and the enhanced long cycle performance of the material is missing in the work. Besides, a comprehensive study of the correlation between the cooling treatment and the structure of the material is also lacking. In this work, we propose a new approach to prepare Mn vacanciesfree Mn-based layered oxides cathode materials through a liquid N2 treatment. The rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (\u0000 196 \u000eC) of liquid N2 take the thermal energy away and freeze the material immediately, providing a superior quenching method to affect the inherent properties/structure of Mn-based layered oxides materials and further improve the specific capacity. Besides, an efficient strategy through low-cost Al and Fe co-doping is introduced to adjust the average valence of Mn ions and suppress biphasic structural transformations during Naþ (de)intercalation [33,35]. The stronger Al–O bonding is beneficial to enlarging the spacing between the Naþ layers and stabilize the Na0.67MnO2 structure as demonstrated in our previous work [35]. And a small amount of Fe-doping is confirmed to disrupt cations ordering and moderate the transition of P2–O2 phases at high voltage, thus significantly enhancing cyclability of materials [33,35]. Accord­ ingly, an optimized low-cost Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.9O2 material with both superior capacity and cycle performance is successfully prepared through this synergetic strategy including liquid N2 quenching and aliovalent doping. Moreover, a systematic study on the correlation between the elec­ trochemical properties, long-range structure and local environment including the Mn ions average valence and structural distortion of the Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4 Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ) materials via doping and different cooling processes (natural cooling, normal quenching and liquid N2 quenching) is further understood by employing exand in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic reso­ nance (ss-NMR) and time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND). The results clearly reveal the superiority of the liquid N2 quenching treatment, which can totally avoid the formation of TM va­ cancies and increase the atomic occupancy of Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center, thus leading to the highest specific capacity, Naþ mobility and electronic conductivity among the prepared samples. Furthermore, the influence of doping on the Mn ions average valence, degree of structural distortion and electrochemical properties is discussed in depth. As a result, our work poses the most fertile directions in the development of high energy and stable cycling NIBs cathode materials based on sustainable Mn element, and provides an ultrahigh performance and low-cost cathode material for NIBs. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Synthesis of materials The Na0.67MnO2, Na0.67M0.1Mn0.9O2 (M 1⁄4 Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ) and Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 samples were prepared via a simple citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. A stoichiometric amount of NaNO3 (with 3% excess of sodium, AR, \u0015 99%), Mn(CH3COO)2\u000f4H2O (AR, \u0015 99%) and doped ions source were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water, and LiNO3 (AR, \u0015 99%), Mg(NO3)2\u000f6H2O (AR, \u0015 99%), Al(NO3)3\u000f9H2O (AR, \u0015 99%) and Fe(NO3)3\u000f9H2O (AR, \u0015 99%) were used as Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ source, respectively. Then the mixed solution was added dropwise into a citric acid solution, and NH3⋅H2O (28%) was used to adjust the pH value to 7–8. The mixed solution was heated to 80 \u000eC and stirred for 12 h to obtain a sol, then dried at 120 \u000eC for 12 h to obtain a gel. The mixture was ground and heated at 450 \u000eC for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the powder was ground again and pressed into pellet, which was calcined at 900 \u000eC for 15 h in air, and then sub­ jected to natural cooling (NC, average cooling rate: 0.8 \u000eC min\u0000 1), quenching (QU, average cooling rate: 79.5 \u000eC min\u0000 1) or liquid N2 quenching (LN) to room temperature and finally stored in Ar-filled glove box. 2.2. Electrochemical tests Electrochemical experiments were carried out in 2032 coin-type cells. The working electrode was prepared by coating the slurry of the active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride in the weight ratio of 8:1:1 using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent onto an Al foil substrate and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 \u000eC. The Na disks were made by rolling sodium chunks into thin sheets, which were then cut into circular plates and used as the counter electrode, and a glass fiber was used as the separator. The electrolyte was composed of a solution of 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) and fluoro­ ethylene carbonate (FEC) (95:5 by volume). The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged on a Neware CT-4008 battery test system at variable current X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 3 rates from 12 to 1200 mA g\u0000 1 (1200 mA g\u0000 1 1⁄4 5C). Rate capabilities tested by charging at 12 mA g\u0000 1 and discharging at the current densities ranging from 12 to 1200 mA g\u0000 1. For galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analyses, the cells were cycled at 24 mA g\u0000 1. The duration time for each applied galvanostatic current and rest was 5 and 50 min, respectively. 2.3. Material characterizations Rigaku Ultima IV and SmartLab-SE X-ray diffractometer were used to collect powder XRD and variable temperature XRD patterns, respec­ tively, using Cu Kα radiation (λ 1⁄4 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA from 10 to 80\u000e (2θ) at a scan speed of 2\u000e min\u0000 1 or 10\u000e min\u0000 1. Timeof-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND) was measured at the VULCAN instrument at the Spallation Neutron Sources (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The diffraction pattern was measured at the detector banks at 2θ 1⁄4 \u0006 90\u000e, equipped 5 mm receiving collimators. Neutron powder diffraction patterns were collected in the high intensity mode (Δd/d ~0.45%) for a duration of 2 h under the nominal 1.4 MW SNS operation, and then processed using VDRIVE software. Rietveld refinement of the XRD and ND patterns were performed using a General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program [36]. In-situ synchrotron XRD patterns were collected in a transmission mode at room tempera­ ture, using ion chamber detectors at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). For in-situ XRD, a standard CR2032 coin cell with small holes in each side was used to perform the experiment. Morphological features of the samples were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope(SEM) and a Philips-FEI Tecnai F20 scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM), oper­ ating at 200 kV. The exact compositions of Na, Mn, Al and Fe were determined by Optima 2000-DV inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer). The ss-NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The 23Na MAS NMR spectra were acquired using a 1.3 mm double-resonance HX probe at a spinning rate of 55 kHz with a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (90\u000epulse – τ – 180\u000epulse – τ) or pj-MATPASS pulse sequence. The 90\u000e pulse length for 23Na was 1.2 μs and the recycle delay used was 20 ms. The 23Na chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M NaCl aqueous solution (0 ppm). The spin-spin relaxation (T2) were also measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time. For direct-current polarization measurements, the fresh powders were compacted under 200 MPa pressure and subjected to various cooling treatments at room temperature. Both surface of pellets were polished and painted with aurum paste, and they were embedded in a stainless steel Swagelok cells to conduct electrical measurement [37]. The direct-current polarization measurements data were fitted by i 1⁄4 i∞ þ (i0-i∞) e-t/τ. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Characterization of prepared materials A group of Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 (NAFMO) materials were Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of naturally cooled, quenched and liquid N2 quenched processes (left), and the effects of different cooling treatment on the vacancies of the electrode structures (right). X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 4 prepared by a sol-gel method followed by a cooling process. The syn­ thesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The precursor materials were sin­ tered at 900 \u000eC for 15 h, and then exposed to three different cooling processes including natural cooling (NC), quenching (QU) and liquid N2 (LN) quenching to 25 \u000eC. Of note, liquid N2 quenching method with rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (\u0000 196 \u000eC) can freeze the samples immediately, providing much faster cooling rate and O2-free condition than normal quenching treatment. ICP-OES is employed to determine the stoichiometric ratios of NAFMO materials (Table S1), which are consistent to the designed composition. The SEM images (Figs. S1a–c) are collected to reveal the morphologies of the prepared materials, exhibiting similar irregular polyhedron shape and smooth surface facets. Moreover, all of the prepared materials present a uniform distribution of Al, Fe and Mn elements and are shown in the TEM and EDS mapping results (Fig. S1d-o). Nevertheless, NAFMO-NC, NAFMOQU and NAFMO-LN materials present the median particle size (D50) of 932.6, 756.5 and 742.3 nm (Fig. S2), respectively, indicating the pri­ mary particle sizes decrease and the bulk diffusion length reduces with the increasing of cooling rate. Additionally, the XRD, TOF PND and ssNMR results demonstrate that the prepared NAFMO materials through different cooling process present very distinct atomic occupancy, local structure and even long-range structure. As shown in Fig. 2a and S3, both of NAFMO-NC and NAFMO-QU materials exhibit a pure hexagonal layered crystalline structure of P2 phase with space group of P63/mmc (PDF#27–0751), while the NAFMO-LN sample presents a distorted P2 phase (denoted as P2’, PDF#27–0752), which includes the standard diffraction patterns of P2 phase and four new diffraction peaks. These four peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase and the decreasing symmetry of crystal lattice, generating diffraction peaks at the relatively lower diffraction angle in comparison to the (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks from P2 phase. Due to the ordered arrangement of TM ions during natural cooling process, two honeycomb-superstructure peaks appear at ~22\u000e and ~32\u000e of NAFMOLN sample [16]. Here, in order to further describe the degree of distortion, the definition of δ is showed in Fig. S4, which is consistent with previous report [30]. The ratio of lattice constant of NAFMO-LN is calculated to be bortho/aortho 1⁄4 1.799, suggesting a slight distortion compared to bortho/aortho 1⁄4 1.830 of the P2’ phase Na0.67MnO2 (S.G. Cmcm), and the degree of distortion, δ, is estimated to be 2.9% (for the P2’ phase, δ 1⁄4 8%) [30]. The high-quality TOF PND data were further collected to investigate the existence of cations vacancies in the TM layers for its highly sensitivity to the distribution of atoms [38]. Rietveld refinements were performed with GSAS [36] and the results of the refined fractional atomic coordinates and atomic occupancy based on XRD and ND are presented in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively, which are highly consistent with each other and with low Rwp values. These results reveal that the atomic occupancies of TM ions in the NAFMO-NC, -QU and -LN samples are 0.922, 0.964 and 1, corresponding to the TM vacancies of 0.078, 0.035 and 0 in the TM layers (Fig. 2b), respectively. Moreover, the full atomic occupancy of Mn ions is expected to generate the lowest Mn ions average valence to satisfy the charge balance in NAFMO materials, which leads to the unequal Mn–O bonds and ortho­ rhombic distortion in the NAFMO-LN sample (Fig. 1 and Table S4). Besides, the lattice parametersa, c and V increase continuously with the rising cooling rate (Fig. S3), due to the larger ions radius of Mn3þ (0.645 Å) than Mn4þ (0.53 Å). More importantly, as shown in Table S3, the continuously expanded extent of Naþ layers spacing indicates that the faster cooling treatment would facilitate the Naþ insertion and extrac­ tion. In summary, our above results reveal that the long-range structure of materials is highly relevant to the cooling process, and a faster cooling treatment can suppress the formation of vacancy more effectively and thus increasing atomic occupancy of Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center in the TM layers. To thoroughly study the structure of the prepared materials, ss-NMR spectroscopy was employed, which is highly sensitive to the local and electronic environment of target nucleus. Previous works have concluded that the characteristic signal of P2 and P2’ phase with obvious orthorhombic distortion are at around 1250 and 850 ppm, respectively [34,39]. Surprisingly, as presented in Fig. 2c and S5, the 23Na NMR spectra of the three materials only show one resonance signal at 1200–1450 ppm, even for the P2’ phase NAFMO-LN sample confirmed by XRD and TOF PND results. The results indicate that such a slight orthorhombic distortion of NAFMO-LN sample have no detectable effect on the local electronic environment of Naþ. Besides, all the spectra show a signal at around 0 ppm due to the diamagnetic sodium salts. Despite the chemical shifts and peak patterns for these three samples are Fig. 2. Structural characterization of Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2.

(d–f) Rietveld refinements of TOF PND patterns for the asprepared samples. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 5 similar, the full width at half maximum for NAFMO-NC (97.49 ppm) sample is significantly broader than that for NAFMO-QU (64.99 ppm) and NAFMO-LN (64.88 ppm) samples (Fig. S5), which indicates that the uniformity of the Naþ local environment improves when accelerating the cooling rate. The local environment of Naþ is highly affected by the number of surrounding Mn ions though Na–O–Mn pathways and the presence of TM ions vacancies increases the types of local environment. Moreover, a higher content of paramagnetic Mn ions will cause a stronger Fermi-contact interaction around Naþ and thus a large chemi­ cal shift [40]. The resonance of NAFMO-QU sample locates at a larger chemical shift than that of the NAFMO-NC sample (Fig. 2c), which further confirm Mn atomic occupancy of NAFMO-QU is higher than that of NAFMO-NC sample. Additionally, the resonance shifts slightly to a lower chemical shift for the NAFMO-LN sample than NAFMO-QU sam­ ple, owing to the much longer Mn–O bonds in orthorhombic distortion phase (Fig. 1 and Table S4) and consequently the Fermi-contact inter­ action around Naþ decreased. To further reveal the effects of different cooling rates on the Naþ (de) intercalation, dynamics of NAFMO-NC/QU/LN materials, T2 (spin spin relaxation times) were obtained by the Hahn-echo method and the fitted results are showed in Fig. 3a. For the paramagnetic solid-state materials, T2 can eliminate the influence of transition metal ions and the faster Naþ hopping rate leads to longer T2 value [41,42]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the T2 value continuously increases with rising the cooling rate and reaches the highest value of 103 μs for the NAFMO-LN sample, which is assigned to the largest Naþ layers spacing (Table S4) and the fastest Naþ hopping rate. Besides, the electronic conductivity, as another important param­ eter for evaluating electrode materials, was measured by direct-current polarization method, and the results are showed in Fig. 3c–d. The ob­ tained electronic conductivity of 3.812x10\u0000 5 S cm\u0000 1 for NAFMO-LN sample is higher than the NAFMO-QU sample (3.227x10\u0000 5 S cm\u0000 1) and much higher than NAFMO-NC sample (9.790x10\u0000 6 S cm\u0000 1), which may be attributed to the increasing contents of Mn3þ promoting electron hopping [37]. Thus, an excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN sam­ ple is expected, due to the fastest Naþ mobility and highest electronic conductivity. The above results have shown that the long-range and local structure of materials are closely related to the cooling rate during the synthesis process. Next, the XRD patterns at variable temperature were performed for a better understanding of the structure evolution during cooling process. Specifically, the precursor was firstly heated up to 900 \u000eC for 15 h in air, and then slowly cooled down to each temperature point. As shown in Fig. S6, the XRD patterns reveal that the material at 900 \u000eC matches well with the standard patterns of P2’ phase, attributed to the low average valence of Mn ions thus leading to an orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase as commented before [29]. As the temperature decreases, the characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with “y“) of P2’ phase are reduced in intensity and they are consecutively shifted to slightly higher diffraction angles due to the contraction of ab plane. The fact corresponds the disappearance of the orthorhombic distortion and the increasing of Mn ions average valence. As the temperature is cooled down to 800 \u000eC and beneath, only P2 phase is observed and its diffraction signals fit perfectly the standard patterns of P2 phase, probably due to the fact that the crystal lattice tends to uptake oxygen in the cooling process [29]. The XRD data obtained at variable temperature fully reveal that the structure of the material subjected at different temperature during cooling process could be obtained by appropriately controlling the cooling rate, and the faster cooling treatment promote maintaining the structure of high-temperature (900 \u000eC). 3.2. Electrochemical performance of Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 cathode materials The electrochemical performance of the NAFMO-NC/QU/LN Fig. 3. (a–b) 23Na NMR T2 fitting results and (c–d) direct-current polarization fitting results of prepared materials. The spin-spin relaxation time (T2) was measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time, fitting by the formula of Mxy 1⁄4 Mxyo \u000f (e-t/T2). Electronic conductivity is calculated by i∞ and Ohm’s law. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 6 materials was evaluated in Na half cells at 30 \u000eC. The galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of the electrodes within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at 12 mA g\u0000 1 (0.05C) current rate are shown in Fig. 4a. As the cooling rate for the prepared materials increases, the following charac­ teristics of first cycle curves deserve special attention: (i) These three samples exhibit smooth charge-discharge profiles, confirming multiple phase transition and Naþ-vacancy ordering during (de)intercalation processes have been suppressed by the introduction of Al and Fe ele­ ments. While the plateaus at ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V become more obvious with increase of cooling rate, which are related to phase transition processes and will be discussed in the next section. (ii) The open circuit voltages (Fig. S7) of the electrodes decrease continuously with the increasing of cooling rate, corresponding to the decrease of Mn ions average valence. (iii) The initial discharge capacities are 131, 175 and 202 mAh g\u0000 1 for NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN, respec­ tively. They are significantly improved with the accelerating cooling rate. To the best our knowledge, NAFMO-LN material has shown the highest initial discharge capacity and specific energy density (~527 Wh kg\u0000 1, solely considering the mass of cathode active material) among reported P2-type sodium oxides materials in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. Furthermore, as the working window is expanded to 1.5–4.5 V (Fig. S8), the capacities delivered by NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN are 210, 224 and 246 mA g\u0000 1, respectively, while an obvious plateau attributing to anionic redox reaction appears at ~4.2 V [17,43,44]. As indicated above, the anionic charge compensation pro­ cess usually shows the poor cyclabilities and slow dynamics in both sodium cathode materials and Li-analogues, so we mainly focus on the working potential below 4 V. In order to meet the needs of the market of smart grids, the requirement for the discharge rates of NIBs is much higher. The rate capabilities were tested by charging at low current and discharging at various currents, the same as previous researches [33,35, 39], and the results are shown in Fig. 4b–c. NAFMO-LN electrode shows the highest capacities and stable cyclabilities at each current density, providing the capacities of 202, 191, 173, 161 and 148 mAh g\u0000 1 as the discharge current densities are increased from 12, 24, 120, 240–480 mA g\u0000 1, respectively. Even with the 100 times increase of the current den­ sity (1200 mA g\u0000 1), the capacity retention is up to 60% (122 mAh g\u0000 1), indicating excellent rate capability among the reported high-rate P2-type electrodes. The diffusion coefficients of Naþ were calculated from GITT results to evaluate the (de)intercalation of kinetics of Naþ during first cycle. As shown in Fig. S9, the geomean DNaþ of NAFMO-LN (2.474 \u0002 10\u0000 10 cm2 s\u0000 1) is slight higher than NAFMO-QU (2.196 \u0002 10\u0000 10 cm2 s\u0000 1) and is much higher than that of NAFMO-NC (5.107 \u0002 10\u0000 11 cm2 s\u0000 1), which is consistent with the best rate performance of liquid N2 treatment sample. In addition, the cycle stabilities of the ma­ terials are also investigated at different current densities of 12 and 1200 mA g\u0000 1 as shown in Fig. S10 and 4d, respectively. At the current density of 12 mA g\u0000 1, NAFMO-LN electrode delivers the highest initial discharge capacity of 202 mAh g\u0000 1 and the highest maintained capacity of 198 mAh g\u0000 1 after ten cycles without any electrode modifications. Espe­ cially, the excellent reversibility and negligible voltage change are found in the charge-discharge curves of NAFMO-LN electrodes. Due to the excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current rate of 1200 mA g\u0000 1. As shown in Fig. 4d and S11, it also maintains the initial capacity of 122 mAh g\u0000 1 and the long cycling stability is achieved with the remarkable capacity retentions of 98% after 100 cycles, 95% after 200 cycles and 81% after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g\u0000 1 with ~100% coulombic efficiency during cycling. The plateaus of ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V are substantial reduction from the comparison dQ/dV curves at low (12 mA g\u0000 1) and high (1200 mA g\u0000 1) current densities, especially the plateau at low voltage which is deemed as the main reason for the ca­ pacity decays due to the notorious Mn3þ Jahn-Teller effects. Ex-situ 23Na NMR was further performed to explore the structure evolutions at high current density. As shown in Fig. S12, the P2 phase signal is maintained during the whole charge process, and thus the electrode could exhibit Fig. 4.

The best rate performance and outstanding overall electro­ chemical properties of NAFMO-LN electrode demonstrate a potential competitive advantage to the general P2 cathodes. Fig. 5.

Long-range and local structural transformations during (De) Sodiation processes In-situ synchrotron XRD was employed to track the long-range structural transformations of NAFMO-LN electrode induced by the (de)intercalation of Naþ at a rate current of 24 mA g\u0000 1. As shown in Fig. 5a, the XRD patterns have been divided into four stages to clarify the structure evolution process more clearly. The (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks are retained during the whole process, corresponding to a quasi-solid-solution reaction rather than typically multiple-phases transition reaction according to the previous reports [45,46]. As indi­ cated above, the prepared electrode is assigned to a P20I phase, which exhibits a slight orthorhombic distortion from P2 phase. At the begin­ ning of charge process, the (020) peak reduces in intensity and shifts to higher angle, corresponding to the decrease of distortion degree, and a P2 phase is formed at x 1⁄4 0.40. Afterwards, a board peak is observed at the higher diffraction angle of 9\u000e at the end of charge process, owing to the formation of small amount of O-type stacking in the P2 structure. As reported by Bruce’s group, this process should be indicated as a “Z” phase evolved by the intergrowth mechanism, which have been mentioned in many P2 compounds, especially those containing Fe3þ [35,47,48]. The formation of “Z” phase is more moderate than O2 phase at high voltage, as the lattice parameter changes are smaller in magni­ tude and less abrupt, leading to a stable structure and better capacity retention [49]. The structural evolution is highly reversible during discharge. Of note, the (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks of P2 phase maintain in the rest of the discharge process, rather than replaced by that of typical P2’ phase with high degree of orthorhombic distortion (denoted as P2’ II). As the x equals 0.79, the characteristic signals of P2’ II phase are presented in both in-situ XRD and ss-NMR (Fig. 5b) results. However, such a moderate phase transition also makes it hard to distinguish between the P2’ I and P2’ II phase from in-situ XRD results. As shown in Fig. 5b, the local environment information of the elec­ trode materials can be observed through 23Na MAS NMR spectra, since Naþ directly participates in the electrochemical reaction in NIBs. 23Na 1D slices were extracted from 2D projection-MATPASS (pj-MATPASS) NMR spectra to eliminate the sideband signals [50]. Consistent with the powder sample, the ss-NMR spectrum of NAFMO-LN pristine electrode also shows the resonance signals at ~1250 ppm and ~0 ppm, rather than monoclinic and hydrated phases that usually occur during elec­ trode prepared process, suggesting that P2’ I phase is stable and structural transitions do not occur during electrode preparing procedure [34,51]. During initial charge and discharge processes, the chemical shift of the signal moves to the high and low value gradually, corre­ spongding to the increase and decrease of the Mn ions average valence, respectively. The local structural evolution is in good agreement with the results of in situ XRD. When the x 1⁄4 0.32, the amount of local environment significantly increases because of the glide of MnO2 layers, a wide peak at ~1100 ppm emerges, corresponding to the “Z” phase. Besides, the P2 phase signal can also be observed at the high voltage and decrease in intensity with “Z” phase emerging, which further proves the formation of “Z” phase is an intermediate and moderate process evolving intergrowth of P2 and O2 phases. The local structure is also highly reversible in discharge process. In x 1⁄4 0.78, the characteristic signal of P2’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distin­ guished from the signal of P2’ I phase. Besides, the P2’ II phase signal of NAFMO-LN sample is much broader than that of non-doped P20-Na0.67MnO2 materials while similar to the stable P2–Na0.67Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 and P2–Na0.67Al0.1Mn0.9O2 materials in previ­ ous works [34,39], corresponding to a much more moderate structure transition and thus better cycle performance. 3.4. Effects of various doping elements on structural and electrochemical properties of materials In order to give some illustration on the significance of the work, the Mn ions average valence of layered oxide materias have been adjusted by introducting different valence doping element, e.g. the introduction of Liþ is expected to rise 3 folds molar equivalents of Mn3þ to Mn4þ, and 2 folds for Mg2þ and equal amount for Al3þ. Therefore, Na0.67M0.1Mn0.9O2 (M 1⁄4 Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ) and non-doped materials were also prepared via the same synthesis process to further reveal the rela­ tionship between the Mn oxidation state, structure and electrochemical properties. The longand short-range structural information are showed in Fig. 6. The obvious orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase can been found in non-doped NMO-QU/-LN and Al3þ-doped NAMO-LN samples with exhibiting the characteristic signals of P2’ phase in both XRD patterns and ss-NMR spectra. Also, orthorhombic distortion is observed for Mg2þ-doped NMMO-LN sample, just like the above results of NAFMO-LN sample. While the Liþ-doped NLMO samples do not show any distortion in both longand short-structure by each cooling treat­ ment. Besides, the full width at half maximum of P2 phase also become narrow continuously with the faster cooling treatment for each prepared material. The above results indicate that the orthorhombic distortion tends to exist in the materials with low theoretical manganese valence and TM vacancies can be suppressed for P2 type Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 by the faster cooling treatment, and then exhibiting a more uniform local environment. A comparison of the electrochemical performance of non-doped and doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials (Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ) prepared by NC, QU and LN methods is shown in Fig. 6a–e. The initial charge and discharge capacities of all prepared materials increase significantly with the accelerating cooling rate, and the maximum capacity is obtained by liquid N2 quenching (LN) treatment for all samples, demonstrating that the rapid cooling treatment can eliminate Mn vacancies, increase redox centers, and effectively improve the capacity of P2 type Na0.67MxMn1xO2. Moreover, Fig. 7f and S13 show that the cycle stablity of Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials is highly related to the Mn ions average valence in the materials except for NAFMO-LN sample, which exhibits optimal electrochemical performance through the synergy effect of Al and Fe co-doping [32,33]. The lower Mn ions average valence causes more severe orthorhombic distortion in Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 and thus being detrimental to cyclability, e.g. the highest specific capacity (215 mAh g\u0000 1, 2–4 V) but lowest capacity retention of non-doped NMO-LN (Mnþ3.33, δ 1⁄4 5.59%) sample, exhibiting many small plateau in galva­ nostatic charge-discharge curves. In contrast, the doped samples exhibit much smoother charge-discharge profiles, which evidences that the introduction of non-electrochemically active element disrupt the TM ordering in the TM layers and hamper Naþ-vacancy ordering during cycling [13]. The 10 mol% of Li-doping material presents a pure P2 phase without any lattice distortion and a stable cycling performance. However, even with liquid N2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mnþ3.59, δ 1⁄4 0%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g\u0000 1. There­ fore, a rational element substitution should be implemented to mitigate Jahn-Teller effect and make a balance bewteen the capacity and cycle stablity to achieve superior electrochemical performance. Thus, the optimal co-doped NAFMO-LN material, with moderate initial Mn ions valence (Mnþ3.39) and slight distortion (δ 1⁄4 2.91%), shows not only an outstanding capacity of 202 mAh g\u0000 1 at voltage range of 2–4 V, but also a satifactory cyclability of 90.4% after 30 cycles at 12 mA g\u0000 1. 4. Conclusion In summary, our comparative results obtained in Na cells of nondoped and doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials with Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ prepared via different cooling processes is verified by using the combination of in-situ synchrotron XRD, TOF PND and ss-NMR mea­ surements. They reveal that a simple liquid N2 quenching treatment X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 9 Fig. 6. (a–d) Powder XRD and (e–h) ss-NMR spectra of Liþ-doped, Mg2þ-doped, Al3þ-doped and non-doped Na0.67MnO2 materials with different cooling treatment. Na0.67Li0.1Mn0.9O2, Na0.67Mg0.1Mn0.9O2, Na0.67Al0.1Mn0.9O2 and Na0.67MnO2 are denoted as NLMO, NMMO, NAMO and NMO, respectively. The spinning sideband signal and the characteristic signal of orthorhombic distortion are marked with “*“and”z“, respectively. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 10 could be regarded as a genaral synergetic strategy to control the for­ mation of vacancy in TM layers and thus to enhance Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center. Consequently, the deliverable capacity of all the Mn-based Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials can be signifcantly improved below 4.0 V, eliminating the factors responsible of capacity dacay such as electrolyte decomposition, structural collapse and oxygen loss at high voltgate. The ss-NMR, GITT and direct-current polarization results demonstrate the highest Naþ mobility and electronic conductivity for the liquid N2 quenching sample, among the three different cooling rate samples. Moreover, we introduced Al and Fe, the top two earth abundance metal elements into TM layers to form the cost-effective Na0.67Al0.1­ Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 compound. After liquid N2 quenching, the slightly dis­ torted Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 delivers a remarkable capacity of 202 and 246 mAh g\u0000 1 within 2.0–4.0 V and 1.5–4.5 V, respectively. Even with 100 times higher current density (1200 mA g\u0000 1), the specific capacity remains up to 122 mAh g\u0000 1 over 600 cycles with 81% capacity retention, indicating exceptional rate and power capabilities with excellent cycling stability. The outstanding overall performance of Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.2 material demonstrated the synergetic strategy of liquid N2 quenching treatment and rational element substitution, which can be used as a general guide for the further development of high ca­ pacity, high power and stable cycling materials, especially for Mn-based layered electrodes in NIBs.

In this work, we propose an effective strategy by a combination of liquid N2 quenching and aliovalent doping to get new layered cathode materials. As evidenced by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction and solid-state 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the proposed synthesis methods allow tuning the transition metal ions vacancies and enhance Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center of P2-type Mnbased materials. Our results demonstrate that such an optimized structure significantly enhances the deliverable capacity, Naþ mobility and electronic conductivity of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of aliovalent doping elements and different cooling approaches on the long-range structure, local environment and electrochemical performance are comprehensively studied by comparing a wide range of doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4 Li, Mg, Al, Fe) materials. The optimized Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 material exhibits a remarkably high initial capacity of 202 mAh g\u0000 1 among ever reported P2-type layered oxides within 2–4 V, a stable capacity retention of 81% after 600 cycles and outstanding rate capability of the specific capacity up to 122 mAh g\u0000 1 at 1200 mA g\u0000 1. 1. Introduction The rapid development of intelligent and environmental-friendly industrial technology, including smart mobile phone and green elec­ tric vehicles, has made rechargeable batteries an indispensable part of our modern society [1,2]. Among various energy storage systems, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with superior high energy and power den­ sities performance have accounted for the key position [3]. Neverthe­ less, the low reserve and uneven distribution of Li resources, and the use of high-cost and toxicity of Co and Ni as redox center for mostly LIBs cathode materials fail to fulfill demands of sustainable development [4]. Recently, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted many interests and are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact that sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural abundance than lithium [5,6]. In the development of NIBs, cathode is the most critical component that restricts cost and energy density in the full batteries [7,8]. Comparing to polyanionic and tunnel-type cathodes materials for NIBs, layered transition metal oxides (NaxMO2, M 1⁄4 transition metal) are extensively studied because of their high theoretical specific capacity * Corresponding author.

Among them, the low-cost Mn-based layered materials are deemed as ideal cathodes for large-scale energy storage. Two types of stacking structures, O3(ABCABC stacking) and P2(AABB stacking) are frequently observed in most of as-synthesized NaxMnO2 materials within layered structure materials [10]. In comparison to the (de)sodiation of O3-type materials via the interstitial tetrahedral sites with relatively higher hopping energy from one octahedral site to another, the P2-type phase allows a direct migration between adjacent prismatic sites, thus enabling rapid Naþ transport and showing better applicability [11]. However, the available capacities of P2-type cathode materials are still insufficient yet [12,13]. To address this issue, anionic redox reaction is introduced as its Li counterpart, which can be triggered to get extra capacity by charging the cells to a higher voltage range of 4.0–4.5 V vs. Naþ/Na (4.3–4.8 V vs. Liþ/Li). Unfortunately, the cathode materials inevitably suffer from electrolyte decomposition, multiple phase transition and even oxygen loss at such a high voltage, resulting in obvious voltage hysteresis and rapid capacity fade [14–17]. In contrast, controlling the cut-off voltage lower than 4 V for P2-type cathode can effectively eliminate aforementioned shortages and yield a much better cyclability, but the reversible capacity is hardly higher than 175 mAh g\u0000 1 [18–22]. Recent investigations have focused on the optimization of the crys­ talline/local structures and morphology engineering of NaxMnO2 by adjusting the Na/Mn ratio, sintering temperature, cooling rate and aliovalent doping [20–25], which further determine the electrochemical performance. However, the overall performance of the materials is far below our expectation. The understanding of underlying structure-property relationship of the materials, especially the local environment including Mn vacancies, is insufficient for obtaining the material with high capacity and long cycle performance. The formation of Mn vacancies in the transition metal (TM) layers have been observed over 40 years [26–29]. Parant et al. proposed that Na0.67MnO2 is able to uptake oxygen during the cooling process [27], resulting in the lift of Mn ions oxidation state and the formation of manganese deficient phases (denoted as □): Na0.67MnO2 þ y/2 O2 → Na0.67MnO2þy (Na0.67/(1þy/2)Mn1/(1þy/2)□(y/2)/(1þy/ 2)O2) The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of Dahn’s group showed a reversible mass gain and decline which are related to the oxygen uptake and release during cooling and heating, respectively [29]. The above works demonstrated that Mn vacancies are inclined to form during cooling process and then adjust the valence of Mn ions. Moreover, previous work has implied that a high-temperature quench­ ing treatment is possibly conducive to eliminate the Mn vacancies, which was reported by Komaba’s group designing distorted P20-Na0.67MnO2 with higher capacity than undistorted P2–Na0.67MnO2 [30], which represent a reasonable approach to synthesize a high-capacity Mn-based cathode material for NIBs [31–33]. However, such quenched samples still contain high content of Mn3þ ions entailing the notorious Jahn-Teller effect and thus multiphase transition during cycling and the enhanced long cycle performance of the material is missing in the work. Besides, a comprehensive study of the correlation between the cooling treatment and the structure of the material is also lacking. In this work, we propose a new approach to prepare Mn vacanciesfree Mn-based layered oxides cathode materials through a liquid N2 treatment. The rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (\u0000 196 \u000eC) of liquid N2 take the thermal energy away and freeze the material immediately, providing a superior quenching method to affect the inherent properties/structure of Mn-based layered oxides materials and further improve the specific capacity. Besides, an efficient strategy through low-cost Al and Fe co-doping is introduced to adjust the average valence of Mn ions and suppress biphasic structural transformations during Naþ (de)intercalation [33,35]. The stronger Al–O bonding is beneficial to enlarging the spacing between the Naþ layers and stabilize the Na0.67MnO2 structure as demonstrated in our previous work [35]. And a small amount of Fe-doping is confirmed to disrupt cations ordering and moderate the transition of P2–O2 phases at high voltage, thus significantly enhancing cyclability of materials [33,35]. Accord­ ingly, an optimized low-cost Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.9O2 material with both superior capacity and cycle performance is successfully prepared through this synergetic strategy including liquid N2 quenching and aliovalent doping. Moreover, a systematic study on the correlation between the elec­ trochemical properties, long-range structure and local environment including the Mn ions average valence and structural distortion of the Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4 Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ) materials via doping and different cooling processes (natural cooling, normal quenching and liquid N2 quenching) is further understood by employing exand in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic reso­ nance (ss-NMR) and time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND). The results clearly reveal the superiority of the liquid N2 quenching treatment, which can totally avoid the formation of TM va­ cancies and increase the atomic occupancy of Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center, thus leading to the highest specific capacity, Naþ mobility and electronic conductivity among the prepared samples. Furthermore, the influence of doping on the Mn ions average valence, degree of structural distortion and electrochemical properties is discussed in depth. As a result, our work poses the most fertile directions in the development of high energy and stable cycling NIBs cathode materials based on sustainable Mn element, and provides an ultrahigh performance and low-cost cathode material for NIBs. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Synthesis of materials The Na0.67MnO2, Na0.67M0.1Mn0.9O2 (M 1⁄4 Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ) and Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 samples were prepared via a simple citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. A stoichiometric amount of NaNO3 (with 3% excess of sodium, AR, \u0015 99%), Mn(CH3COO)2\u000f4H2O (AR, \u0015 99%) and doped ions source were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water, and LiNO3 (AR, \u0015 99%), Mg(NO3)2\u000f6H2O (AR, \u0015 99%), Al(NO3)3\u000f9H2O (AR, \u0015 99%) and Fe(NO3)3\u000f9H2O (AR, \u0015 99%) were used as Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ source, respectively. Then the mixed solution was added dropwise into a citric acid solution, and NH3⋅H2O (28%) was used to adjust the pH value to 7–8. The mixed solution was heated to 80 \u000eC and stirred for 12 h to obtain a sol, then dried at 120 \u000eC for 12 h to obtain a gel. The mixture was ground and heated at 450 \u000eC for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the powder was ground again and pressed into pellet, which was calcined at 900 \u000eC for 15 h in air, and then sub­ jected to natural cooling (NC, average cooling rate: 0.8 \u000eC min\u0000 1), quenching (QU, average cooling rate: 79.5 \u000eC min\u0000 1) or liquid N2 quenching (LN) to room temperature and finally stored in Ar-filled glove box. 2.2. Electrochemical tests Electrochemical experiments were carried out in 2032 coin-type cells. The working electrode was prepared by coating the slurry of the active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride in the weight ratio of 8:1:1 using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent onto an Al foil substrate and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 \u000eC. The Na disks were made by rolling sodium chunks into thin sheets, which were then cut into circular plates and used as the counter electrode, and a glass fiber was used as the separator. The electrolyte was composed of a solution of 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) and fluoro­ ethylene carbonate (FEC) (95:5 by volume). The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged on a Neware CT-4008 battery test system at variable current X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 3 rates from 12 to 1200 mA g\u0000 1 (1200 mA g\u0000 1 1⁄4 5C). Rate capabilities tested by charging at 12 mA g\u0000 1 and discharging at the current densities ranging from 12 to 1200 mA g\u0000 1. For galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analyses, the cells were cycled at 24 mA g\u0000 1. The duration time for each applied galvanostatic current and rest was 5 and 50 min, respectively. 2.3. Material characterizations Rigaku Ultima IV and SmartLab-SE X-ray diffractometer were used to collect powder XRD and variable temperature XRD patterns, respec­ tively, using Cu Kα radiation (λ 1⁄4 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA from 10 to 80\u000e (2θ) at a scan speed of 2\u000e min\u0000 1 or 10\u000e min\u0000 1. Timeof-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND) was measured at the VULCAN instrument at the Spallation Neutron Sources (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The diffraction pattern was measured at the detector banks at 2θ 1⁄4 \u0006 90\u000e, equipped 5 mm receiving collimators. Neutron powder diffraction patterns were collected in the high intensity mode (Δd/d ~0.45%) for a duration of 2 h under the nominal 1.4 MW SNS operation, and then processed using VDRIVE software. Rietveld refinement of the XRD and ND patterns were performed using a General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program [36]. In-situ synchrotron XRD patterns were collected in a transmission mode at room tempera­ ture, using ion chamber detectors at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). For in-situ XRD, a standard CR2032 coin cell with small holes in each side was used to perform the experiment. Morphological features of the samples were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope(SEM) and a Philips-FEI Tecnai F20 scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM), oper­ ating at 200 kV. The exact compositions of Na, Mn, Al and Fe were determined by Optima 2000-DV inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer). The ss-NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The 23Na MAS NMR spectra were acquired using a 1.3 mm double-resonance HX probe at a spinning rate of 55 kHz with a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (90\u000epulse – τ – 180\u000epulse – τ) or pj-MATPASS pulse sequence. The 90\u000e pulse length for 23Na was 1.2 μs and the recycle delay used was 20 ms. The 23Na chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M NaCl aqueous solution (0 ppm). The spin-spin relaxation (T2) were also measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time. For direct-current polarization measurements, the fresh powders were compacted under 200 MPa pressure and subjected to various cooling treatments at room temperature. Both surface of pellets were polished and painted with aurum paste, and they were embedded in a stainless steel Swagelok cells to conduct electrical measurement [37]. The direct-current polarization measurements data were fitted by i 1⁄4 i∞ þ (i0-i∞) e-t/τ. 3. Results and discussions 3.1.

Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 4 prepared by a sol-gel method followed by a cooling process. The syn­ thesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The precursor materials were sin­ tered at 900 \u000eC for 15 h, and then exposed to three different cooling processes including natural cooling (NC), quenching (QU) and liquid N2 (LN) quenching to 25 \u000eC. Of note, liquid N2 quenching method with rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (\u0000 196 \u000eC) can freeze the samples immediately, providing much faster cooling rate and O2-free condition than normal quenching treatment. ICP-OES is employed to determine the stoichiometric ratios of NAFMO materials (Table S1), which are consistent to the designed composition. The SEM images (Figs. S1a–c) are collected to reveal the morphologies of the prepared materials, exhibiting similar irregular polyhedron shape and smooth surface facets. Moreover, all of the prepared materials present a uniform distribution of Al, Fe and Mn elements and are shown in the TEM and EDS mapping results (Fig. S1d-o). Nevertheless, NAFMO-NC, NAFMOQU and NAFMO-LN materials present the median particle size (D50) of 932.6, 756.5 and 742.3 nm (Fig. S2), respectively, indicating the pri­ mary particle sizes decrease and the bulk diffusion length reduces with the increasing of cooling rate. Additionally, the XRD, TOF PND and ssNMR results demonstrate that the prepared NAFMO materials through different cooling process present very distinct atomic occupancy, local structure and even long-range structure. As shown in Fig. 2a and S3, both of NAFMO-NC and NAFMO-QU materials exhibit a pure hexagonal layered crystalline structure of P2 phase with space group of P63/mmc (PDF#27–0751), while the NAFMO-LN sample presents a distorted P2 phase (denoted as P2’, PDF#27–0752), which includes the standard diffraction patterns of P2 phase and four new diffraction peaks. These four peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase and the decreasing symmetry of crystal lattice, generating diffraction peaks at the relatively lower diffraction angle in comparison to the (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks from P2 phase. Due to the ordered arrangement of TM ions during natural cooling process, two honeycomb-superstructure peaks appear at ~22\u000e and ~32\u000e of NAFMOLN sample [16]. Here, in order to further describe the degree of distortion, the definition of δ is showed in Fig. S4, which is consistent with previous report [30]. The ratio of lattice constant of NAFMO-LN is calculated to be bortho/aortho 1⁄4 1.799, suggesting a slight distortion compared to bortho/aortho 1⁄4 1.830 of the P2’ phase Na0.67MnO2 (S.G. Cmcm), and the degree of distortion, δ, is estimated to be 2.9% (for the P2’ phase, δ 1⁄4 8%) [30]. The high-quality TOF PND data were further collected to investigate the existence of cations vacancies in the TM layers for its highly sensitivity to the distribution of atoms [38]. Rietveld refinements were performed with GSAS [36] and the results of the refined fractional atomic coordinates and atomic occupancy based on XRD and ND are presented in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively, which are highly consistent with each other and with low Rwp values. These results reveal that the atomic occupancies of TM ions in the NAFMO-NC, -QU and -LN samples are 0.922, 0.964 and 1, corresponding to the TM vacancies of 0.078, 0.035 and 0 in the TM layers (Fig. 2b), respectively. Moreover, the full atomic occupancy of Mn ions is expected to generate the lowest Mn ions average valence to satisfy the charge balance in NAFMO materials, which leads to the unequal Mn–O bonds and ortho­ rhombic distortion in the NAFMO-LN sample (Fig. 1 and Table S4). Besides, the lattice parametersa, c and V increase continuously with the rising cooling rate (Fig. S3), due to the larger ions radius of Mn3þ (0.645 Å) than Mn4þ (0.53 Å). More importantly, as shown in Table S3, the continuously expanded extent of Naþ layers spacing indicates that the faster cooling treatment would facilitate the Naþ insertion and extrac­ tion. In summary, our above results reveal that the long-range structure of materials is highly relevant to the cooling process, and a faster cooling treatment can suppress the formation of vacancy more effectively and thus increasing atomic occupancy of Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center in the TM layers. To thoroughly study the structure of the prepared materials, ss-NMR spectroscopy was employed, which is highly sensitive to the local and electronic environment of target nucleus. Previous works have concluded that the characteristic signal of P2 and P2’ phase with obvious orthorhombic distortion are at around 1250 and 850 ppm, respectively [34,39]. Surprisingly, as presented in Fig. 2c and S5, the 23Na NMR spectra of the three materials only show one resonance signal at 1200–1450 ppm, even for the P2’ phase NAFMO-LN sample confirmed by XRD and TOF PND results. The results indicate that such a slight orthorhombic distortion of NAFMO-LN sample have no detectable effect on the local electronic environment of Naþ. Besides, all the spectra show a signal at around 0 ppm due to the diamagnetic sodium salts. Despite the chemical shifts and peak patterns for these three samples are Fig. 2.

(d–f) Rietveld refinements of TOF PND patterns for the asprepared samples. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 5 similar, the full width at half maximum for NAFMO-NC (97.49 ppm) sample is significantly broader than that for NAFMO-QU (64.99 ppm) and NAFMO-LN (64.88 ppm) samples (Fig. S5), which indicates that the uniformity of the Naþ local environment improves when accelerating the cooling rate. The local environment of Naþ is highly affected by the number of surrounding Mn ions though Na–O–Mn pathways and the presence of TM ions vacancies increases the types of local environment. Moreover, a higher content of paramagnetic Mn ions will cause a stronger Fermi-contact interaction around Naþ and thus a large chemi­ cal shift [40]. The resonance of NAFMO-QU sample locates at a larger chemical shift than that of the NAFMO-NC sample (Fig. 2c), which further confirm Mn atomic occupancy of NAFMO-QU is higher than that of NAFMO-NC sample. Additionally, the resonance shifts slightly to a lower chemical shift for the NAFMO-LN sample than NAFMO-QU sam­ ple, owing to the much longer Mn–O bonds in orthorhombic distortion phase (Fig. 1 and Table S4) and consequently the Fermi-contact inter­ action around Naþ decreased. To further reveal the effects of different cooling rates on the Naþ (de) intercalation, dynamics of NAFMO-NC/QU/LN materials, T2 (spin spin relaxation times) were obtained by the Hahn-echo method and the fitted results are showed in Fig. 3a. For the paramagnetic solid-state materials, T2 can eliminate the influence of transition metal ions and the faster Naþ hopping rate leads to longer T2 value [41,42]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the T2 value continuously increases with rising the cooling rate and reaches the highest value of 103 μs for the NAFMO-LN sample, which is assigned to the largest Naþ layers spacing (Table S4) and the fastest Naþ hopping rate. Besides, the electronic conductivity, as another important param­ eter for evaluating electrode materials, was measured by direct-current polarization method, and the results are showed in Fig. 3c–d. The ob­ tained electronic conductivity of 3.812x10\u0000 5 S cm\u0000 1 for NAFMO-LN sample is higher than the NAFMO-QU sample (3.227x10\u0000 5 S cm\u0000 1) and much higher than NAFMO-NC sample (9.790x10\u0000 6 S cm\u0000 1), which may be attributed to the increasing contents of Mn3þ promoting electron hopping [37]. Thus, an excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN sam­ ple is expected, due to the fastest Naþ mobility and highest electronic conductivity. The above results have shown that the long-range and local structure of materials are closely related to the cooling rate during the synthesis process. Next, the XRD patterns at variable temperature were performed for a better understanding of the structure evolution during cooling process. Specifically, the precursor was firstly heated up to 900 \u000eC for 15 h in air, and then slowly cooled down to each temperature point. As shown in Fig. S6, the XRD patterns reveal that the material at 900 \u000eC matches well with the standard patterns of P2’ phase, attributed to the low average valence of Mn ions thus leading to an orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase as commented before [29]. As the temperature decreases, the characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with “y“) of P2’ phase are reduced in intensity and they are consecutively shifted to slightly higher diffraction angles due to the contraction of ab plane. The fact corresponds the disappearance of the orthorhombic distortion and the increasing of Mn ions average valence. As the temperature is cooled down to 800 \u000eC and beneath, only P2 phase is observed and its diffraction signals fit perfectly the standard patterns of P2 phase, probably due to the fact that the crystal lattice tends to uptake oxygen in the cooling process [29]. The XRD data obtained at variable temperature fully reveal that the structure of the material subjected at different temperature during cooling process could be obtained by appropriately controlling the cooling rate, and the faster cooling treatment promote maintaining the structure of high-temperature (900 \u000eC). 3.2. Electrochemical performance of Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 cathode materials The electrochemical performance of the NAFMO-NC/QU/LN Fig. 3. (a–b) 23Na NMR T2 fitting results and (c–d) direct-current polarization fitting results of prepared materials. The spin-spin relaxation time (T2) was measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time, fitting by the formula of Mxy 1⁄4 Mxyo \u000f (e-t/T2). Electronic conductivity is calculated by i∞ and Ohm’s law. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 6 materials was evaluated in Na half cells at 30 \u000eC. The galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of the electrodes within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at 12 mA g\u0000 1 (0.05C) current rate are shown in Fig. 4a. As the cooling rate for the prepared materials increases, the following charac­ teristics of first cycle curves deserve special attention: (i) These three samples exhibit smooth charge-discharge profiles, confirming multiple phase transition and Naþ-vacancy ordering during (de)intercalation processes have been suppressed by the introduction of Al and Fe ele­ ments. While the plateaus at ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V become more obvious with increase of cooling rate, which are related to phase transition processes and will be discussed in the next section. (ii) The open circuit voltages (Fig. S7) of the electrodes decrease continuously with the increasing of cooling rate, corresponding to the decrease of Mn ions average valence. (iii) The initial discharge capacities are 131, 175 and 202 mAh g\u0000 1 for NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN, respec­ tively. They are significantly improved with the accelerating cooling rate. To the best our knowledge, NAFMO-LN material has shown the highest initial discharge capacity and specific energy density (~527 Wh kg\u0000 1, solely considering the mass of cathode active material) among reported P2-type sodium oxides materials in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. Furthermore, as the working window is expanded to 1.5–4.5 V (Fig. S8), the capacities delivered by NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN are 210, 224 and 246 mA g\u0000 1, respectively, while an obvious plateau attributing to anionic redox reaction appears at ~4.2 V [17,43,44]. As indicated above, the anionic charge compensation pro­ cess usually shows the poor cyclabilities and slow dynamics in both sodium cathode materials and Li-analogues, so we mainly focus on the working potential below 4 V. In order to meet the needs of the market of smart grids, the requirement for the discharge rates of NIBs is much higher. The rate capabilities were tested by charging at low current and discharging at various currents, the same as previous researches [33,35, 39], and the results are shown in Fig. 4b–c. NAFMO-LN electrode shows the highest capacities and stable cyclabilities at each current density, providing the capacities of 202, 191, 173, 161 and 148 mAh g\u0000 1 as the discharge current densities are increased from 12, 24, 120, 240–480 mA g\u0000 1, respectively. Even with the 100 times increase of the current den­ sity (1200 mA g\u0000 1), the capacity retention is up to 60% (122 mAh g\u0000 1), indicating excellent rate capability among the reported high-rate P2-type electrodes. The diffusion coefficients of Naþ were calculated from GITT results to evaluate the (de)intercalation of kinetics of Naþ during first cycle. As shown in Fig. S9, the geomean DNaþ of NAFMO-LN (2.474 \u0002 10\u0000 10 cm2 s\u0000 1) is slight higher than NAFMO-QU (2.196 \u0002 10\u0000 10 cm2 s\u0000 1) and is much higher than that of NAFMO-NC (5.107 \u0002 10\u0000 11 cm2 s\u0000 1), which is consistent with the best rate performance of liquid N2 treatment sample. In addition, the cycle stabilities of the ma­ terials are also investigated at different current densities of 12 and 1200 mA g\u0000 1 as shown in Fig. S10 and 4d, respectively. At the current density of 12 mA g\u0000 1, NAFMO-LN electrode delivers the highest initial discharge capacity of 202 mAh g\u0000 1 and the highest maintained capacity of 198 mAh g\u0000 1 after ten cycles without any electrode modifications. Espe­ cially, the excellent reversibility and negligible voltage change are found in the charge-discharge curves of NAFMO-LN electrodes. Due to the excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current rate of 1200 mA g\u0000 1. As shown in Fig. 4d and S11, it also maintains the initial capacity of 122 mAh g\u0000 1 and the long cycling stability is achieved with the remarkable capacity retentions of 98% after 100 cycles, 95% after 200 cycles and 81% after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g\u0000 1 with ~100% coulombic efficiency during cycling. The plateaus of ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V are substantial reduction from the comparison dQ/dV curves at low (12 mA g\u0000 1) and high (1200 mA g\u0000 1) current densities, especially the plateau at low voltage which is deemed as the main reason for the ca­ pacity decays due to the notorious Mn3þ Jahn-Teller effects. Ex-situ 23Na NMR was further performed to explore the structure evolutions at high current density. As shown in Fig. S12, the P2 phase signal is maintained during the whole charge process, and thus the electrode could exhibit Fig. 4.

The best rate performance and outstanding overall electro­ chemical properties of NAFMO-LN electrode demonstrate a potential competitive advantage to the general P2 cathodes. Fig. 5.

Long-range and local structural transformations during (De) Sodiation processes In-situ synchrotron XRD was employed to track the long-range structural transformations of NAFMO-LN electrode induced by the (de)intercalation of Naþ at a rate current of 24 mA g\u0000 1. As shown in Fig. 5a, the XRD patterns have been divided into four stages to clarify the structure evolution process more clearly. The (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks are retained during the whole process, corresponding to a quasi-solid-solution reaction rather than typically multiple-phases transition reaction according to the previous reports [45,46]. As indi­ cated above, the prepared electrode is assigned to a P20I phase, which exhibits a slight orthorhombic distortion from P2 phase. At the begin­ ning of charge process, the (020) peak reduces in intensity and shifts to higher angle, corresponding to the decrease of distortion degree, and a P2 phase is formed at x 1⁄4 0.40. Afterwards, a board peak is observed at the higher diffraction angle of 9\u000e at the end of charge process, owing to the formation of small amount of O-type stacking in the P2 structure. As reported by Bruce’s group, this process should be indicated as a “Z” phase evolved by the intergrowth mechanism, which have been mentioned in many P2 compounds, especially those containing Fe3þ [35,47,48]. The formation of “Z” phase is more moderate than O2 phase at high voltage, as the lattice parameter changes are smaller in magni­ tude and less abrupt, leading to a stable structure and better capacity retention [49]. The structural evolution is highly reversible during discharge. Of note, the (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks of P2 phase maintain in the rest of the discharge process, rather than replaced by that of typical P2’ phase with high degree of orthorhombic distortion (denoted as P2’ II). As the x equals 0.79, the characteristic signals of P2’ II phase are presented in both in-situ XRD and ss-NMR (Fig. 5b) results. However, such a moderate phase transition also makes it hard to distinguish between the P2’ I and P2’ II phase from in-situ XRD results. As shown in Fig. 5b, the local environment information of the elec­ trode materials can be observed through 23Na MAS NMR spectra, since Naþ directly participates in the electrochemical reaction in NIBs. 23Na 1D slices were extracted from 2D projection-MATPASS (pj-MATPASS) NMR spectra to eliminate the sideband signals [50]. Consistent with the powder sample, the ss-NMR spectrum of NAFMO-LN pristine electrode also shows the resonance signals at ~1250 ppm and ~0 ppm, rather than monoclinic and hydrated phases that usually occur during elec­ trode prepared process, suggesting that P2’ I phase is stable and structural transitions do not occur during electrode preparing procedure [34,51]. During initial charge and discharge processes, the chemical shift of the signal moves to the high and low value gradually, corre­ spongding to the increase and decrease of the Mn ions average valence, respectively. The local structural evolution is in good agreement with the results of in situ XRD. When the x 1⁄4 0.32, the amount of local environment significantly increases because of the glide of MnO2 layers, a wide peak at ~1100 ppm emerges, corresponding to the “Z” phase. Besides, the P2 phase signal can also be observed at the high voltage and decrease in intensity with “Z” phase emerging, which further proves the formation of “Z” phase is an intermediate and moderate process evolving intergrowth of P2 and O2 phases. The local structure is also highly reversible in discharge process. In x 1⁄4 0.78, the characteristic signal of P2’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distin­ guished from the signal of P2’ I phase. Besides, the P2’ II phase signal of NAFMO-LN sample is much broader than that of non-doped P20-Na0.67MnO2 materials while similar to the stable P2–Na0.67Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 and P2–Na0.67Al0.1Mn0.9O2 materials in previ­ ous works [34,39], corresponding to a much more moderate structure transition and thus better cycle performance. 3.4. Effects of various doping elements on structural and electrochemical properties of materials In order to give some illustration on the significance of the work, the Mn ions average valence of layered oxide materias have been adjusted by introducting different valence doping element, e.g. the introduction of Liþ is expected to rise 3 folds molar equivalents of Mn3þ to Mn4þ, and 2 folds for Mg2þ and equal amount for Al3þ. Therefore, Na0.67M0.1Mn0.9O2 (M 1⁄4 Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ) and non-doped materials were also prepared via the same synthesis process to further reveal the rela­ tionship between the Mn oxidation state, structure and electrochemical properties. The longand short-range structural information are showed in Fig. 6. The obvious orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase can been found in non-doped NMO-QU/-LN and Al3þ-doped NAMO-LN samples with exhibiting the characteristic signals of P2’ phase in both XRD patterns and ss-NMR spectra. Also, orthorhombic distortion is observed for Mg2þ-doped NMMO-LN sample, just like the above results of NAFMO-LN sample. While the Liþ-doped NLMO samples do not show any distortion in both longand short-structure by each cooling treat­ ment. Besides, the full width at half maximum of P2 phase also become narrow continuously with the faster cooling treatment for each prepared material. The above results indicate that the orthorhombic distortion tends to exist in the materials with low theoretical manganese valence and TM vacancies can be suppressed for P2 type Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 by the faster cooling treatment, and then exhibiting a more uniform local environment. A comparison of the electrochemical performance of non-doped and doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials (Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ) prepared by NC, QU and LN methods is shown in Fig. 6a–e. The initial charge and discharge capacities of all prepared materials increase significantly with the accelerating cooling rate, and the maximum capacity is obtained by liquid N2 quenching (LN) treatment for all samples, demonstrating that the rapid cooling treatment can eliminate Mn vacancies, increase redox centers, and effectively improve the capacity of P2 type Na0.67MxMn1xO2. Moreover, Fig. 7f and S13 show that the cycle stablity of Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials is highly related to the Mn ions average valence in the materials except for NAFMO-LN sample, which exhibits optimal electrochemical performance through the synergy effect of Al and Fe co-doping [32,33]. The lower Mn ions average valence causes more severe orthorhombic distortion in Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 and thus being detrimental to cyclability, e.g. the highest specific capacity (215 mAh g\u0000 1, 2–4 V) but lowest capacity retention of non-doped NMO-LN (Mnþ3.33, δ 1⁄4 5.59%) sample, exhibiting many small plateau in galva­ nostatic charge-discharge curves. In contrast, the doped samples exhibit much smoother charge-discharge profiles, which evidences that the introduction of non-electrochemically active element disrupt the TM ordering in the TM layers and hamper Naþ-vacancy ordering during cycling [13]. The 10 mol% of Li-doping material presents a pure P2 phase without any lattice distortion and a stable cycling performance. However, even with liquid N2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mnþ3.59, δ 1⁄4 0%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g\u0000 1. There­ fore, a rational element substitution should be implemented to mitigate Jahn-Teller effect and make a balance bewteen the capacity and cycle stablity to achieve superior electrochemical performance. Thus, the optimal co-doped NAFMO-LN material, with moderate initial Mn ions valence (Mnþ3.39) and slight distortion (δ 1⁄4 2.91%), shows not only an outstanding capacity of 202 mAh g\u0000 1 at voltage range of 2–4 V, but also a satifactory cyclability of 90.4% after 30 cycles at 12 mA g\u0000 1. 4. Conclusion In summary, our comparative results obtained in Na cells of nondoped and doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials with Liþ, Mg2þ, Al3þ and Fe3þ prepared via different cooling processes is verified by using the combination of in-situ synchrotron XRD, TOF PND and ss-NMR mea­ surements. They reveal that a simple liquid N2 quenching treatment X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 9 Fig. 6.

Na0.67Li0.1Mn0.9O2, Na0.67Mg0.1Mn0.9O2, Na0.67Al0.1Mn0.9O2 and Na0.67MnO2 are denoted as NLMO, NMMO, NAMO and NMO, respectively. The spinning sideband signal and the characteristic signal of orthorhombic distortion are marked with “*“and”z“, respectively. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 10 could be regarded as a genaral synergetic strategy to control the for­ mation of vacancy in TM layers and thus to enhance Mn4þ/Mn3þ redox center. Consequently, the deliverable capacity of all the Mn-based Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials can be signifcantly improved below 4.0 V, eliminating the factors responsible of capacity dacay such as electrolyte decomposition, structural collapse and oxygen loss at high voltgate. The ss-NMR, GITT and direct-current polarization results demonstrate the highest Naþ mobility and electronic conductivity for the liquid N2 quenching sample, among the three different cooling rate samples. Moreover, we introduced Al and Fe, the top two earth abundance metal elements into TM layers to form the cost-effective Na0.67Al0.1­ Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 compound. After liquid N2 quenching, the slightly dis­ torted Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 delivers a remarkable capacity of 202 and 246 mAh g\u0000 1 within 2.0–4.0 V and 1.5–4.5 V, respectively. Even with 100 times higher current density (1200 mA g\u0000 1), the specific capacity remains up to 122 mAh g\u0000 1 over 600 cycles with 81% capacity retention, indicating exceptional rate and power capabilities with excellent cycling stability. The outstanding overall performance of Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.2 material demonstrated the synergetic strategy of liquid N2 quenching treatment and rational element substitution, which can be used as a general guide for the further development of high ca­ pacity, high power and stable cycling materials, especially for Mn-based layered electrodes in NIBs.

However, the energy density, rate performance, and cycle stability of sodium-ion batteries are still limited by cathode materials. To improve its electrochemical performance, we adopted doping Co at the Mn site to increase the proportion of Mn4+, suppressing the P2-P2 ́ distortion generated by Mn3+. Here, layered oxides P2-Na0.67Mn1−xCoxO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared cathode materials have the characteristics of uniform dispersion and obvious layered structure. The XRD refinement results show that the lattice parameters a of Co-doped material is reduced, but the layer spacing d is enlarged, which can be conducive to the diffusion of Na+ and the improvement of rate performance along with firstprinciples calculations has been used to characterize the charge storage mechanism. Moreover, electro­ chemical performance tests show that NCM2 has superior electrochemical performance. At the ampere density of 2 C, the material still has 88.7% capacity retention rate combined with excellent cycle stability after 200 cycles. © 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. 1. Introduction For the sake of realizing the sustainable development of human society, the employment of clean energy instead of fossil fuel has become the requirement of contemporary society. In the wake of the rapidly growing demand for large-scale energy storage systems, electric vehicles, smart grids, and rechargeable batteries with high energy and power density are the most sensible choice for various energy storage technologies [1–3]. Electrochemical energy storage represented by lithium-ion batteries has become the main energy storage method now. However, lithium reserves are not abundant, and the increasing cost restrict its extensive and large-scale appli­ cation. By contrast, sodium is currently the fourth-largest element in the earth’s crust, and it is cheap. Therefore, sodium ion batteries are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in some specific energy storage markets, which can alleviate the shortage of lithium re­ sources to a certain extent [4,5]. Both Li and Na are alkali metals, the ionic radius of Na+ is larger than Li+ (1.02 vs 0.76) [6–8]. Recently, P2-type materials have attracted considerable interest because of their excellent cycling stability and rate capacity [9,10]. The layered P2 phase structure NaxMO2 with high specific capacity has received widespread atten­ tion due to its attractive price combined with environmental friendliness [11]. However, the expected electrochemical perfor­ mance for P2-NaxMO2 is often unsatisfactory. This is mainly due to the serious Jahn–Teller effect related to the Mn3+/Mn4+redox couple, causing the P2-P2' phase transition [12] thereby affecting Na+ transport kinetics [13]. A prime symbol (′) is used to indicate inplane distortion of the hexagonal lattice in the crystal structure, such as for P2-type [14]. The distortion reduces the Na+ mobility and further leads to structural collapse during repeated cycles. Therefore, further processing and optimization of structural stability are of great concern. Element doping is generally considered to be an ef­ fective measure to reduce the deformation of transition metal layer spacing and thus improve the reversibility of the structure. Where­ fore, understanding the effect of different doping elements is key to further develop and optimize NaxMO2 cathodes for NIBs. For in­ stance, Ni is used to providing high voltage to elevate the average discharge voltage [14–17]. Fe doping suppresses minor structural transitions during cycling and Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple provides higher working potential [18]. Mg can stabilize the structure by suppressing structural deformation to the orthogonal phase, but the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165569 0925-8388/© 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. ]]]] ]]]]]] ⁎ Corresponding author at: Xi'an Key Laboratory of Clean Energy, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, 710055 Xi’an, PR China E-mail address: juanwang@xauat.edu.cn (J. Wang). Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 incorporation of inactive Mg will affect the activity of Mn3+/ Mn4+ [19–21]. However, Co is an interesting alternative, which can be involved in redox reactions in parallel with Mn during the cycle. Wang et al. [22] have successfully synthesized P2 − Na2/3MnyCo1−yO2 by con­ ventional solid state reaction. However, diffusion of Na+ has not been adequately studied. Although P2-Na0.67Co0.5Mn0.5O2 prepared by Zhu et al. [23] has excellent cycle performance, NCM55 doped by 50 % Co doping is challenging for commercial applications owing to the expensive price of Co. Nicolas et al. [24] concentrate on improving the electrode performance of materials by regulating the mor­ phology. It was pointed out that the electrochemistry performance of the flake structure material doped was not outstanding. Konarov et al. [25] mainly conducted work on the P2-P2' phase transition. But we prove that Co has an advantageous inhibitory effect on the P2-P2' phase transition besides the improvement of Na+ diffusion used by lattice parameter changes and DFT. It is worth mentioning that, the flake structure with an obvious and uniform size prepared by the hydrothermal method can promote the diffusion of Na+ and accel­ erate the reaction rate. As far as we know, the influence of Co on Na0.67MnO2 is considered for the first time comprehensively and profoundly from the aspects of morphology, crystal structure, and electronic structure. In addition, although Co has a prominent effect on the improvement of electrochemical performance, the price of Co is relatively high. Using of less stoichiometric ratio is also a promi­ nent factor that must be taken into consideration. Here, Na0.67Mn1−xCoxO2 (x = 0,0.1,0.2) prepared by hydrothermal method have been studied as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The Co3+ and Mn4+ were stable and randomly distributed in the transition metal layer. Most importantly, the incorporation of Co can effectively lower the Mn3+ with the Jahn-Teller effect and lessen the irreversible distortion of P2-P2 ́ material. Furthermore, the particles of NCM2 prepared by the hydrothermal method have high purity, and uniform particle size, which were conducive to the diffusion of Na+ and accelerate the reaction rate. In this paper, we comprehend the positive role of Co doping in the Na0.67MnO2 cathode using a series of electrochemical analysis methods. 2. Experiment section All chemicals used are received from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. The precursor was synthesized by using am­ monium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) as a precipitant assisted through the hydrothermal method. First, a certain stoichiometric solution of cobalt acetate and manganese acetate with a ratio of 1/10:9/10 was added into 30 mL deionized water and stirred to form a uniform solution, then a certain amount of NH4HCO3 was added into the above solution for uniform stirring. The resulting solution was put into the reactor. Set the temperature of the chemical reaction. After natural cooling, the hydrothermal reaction product was filtered and then washed three times. Vacuum drying at 80 °C for 24 h, the precursor was obtained and calcined at 500 °C for 6 h. After natural cooling, the precursor and excess 5 %mol of anhydrous sodium car­ bonate were fully ground in an agate mortar and calcined at 900 °C for 10 h, Na0.67Co0.1Mn0.9O2 (NCM1) was obtained, and Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2(NCM2) and Na0.67MnO2 (NM) were prepared with the same method described above. The preparation diagram is shown in Fig. 1. 2.1. Materials characterization The phase composition of the composites was analyzed by X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD-700) made by Shimadzu Manufacturing Institute in Japan. The scanning range was set at 10°~ 80° and the scanning rate was 2°min−1. The surface morphology of the materials was characterized by an S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM JSM-7610 F) made by Hitachi Company, Japan, and the distribution of elements was analyzed by energy spectrum analysis (EDS). 2.2. Electrochemical measurement The cathode electrodes were composed of 70 wt % of active material, 20 wt % of poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and 10 wt % of super-P. Sodium metal was applied to the counter electrode, whereas hard carbon was used as anode for the full cell. 1 M NaPF6 in an EC/DEC (1:1 v/v) was used as electrolyte. A glass fiber (GF/D) was served as a separator. The mass loading of active material was around 1.2 mg/cm2. The CR2032 cell was assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. Neware battery test system was used for conducting electrochemical tests performed with constant current between 1.5 and 4.0 V. The electrochemical impedance (EIS) test was the CHI660D electrochemical workstation produced by Shanghai Morning China Instrument Co. Ltd. The frequency of EIS test was 0.01 Hz~100KHz. The surface chemistry element composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI QUAN­ TERA-II SXM). 3. Results and discussion Examination of the XRD patterns demonstrates that single-phase materials were obtained for all the studied compositions. This was confirmed by Rietveld refinement using the Fullprof suite Program (Fig. 2a-c). The materials showed a P2-type structure, crystallized in the P63/mmc space group. The diffraction peaks of all the samples are consistent with the standard card PDF27–0571[26]. Furthermore, no impurity peak is observed, which indicates that Co is well in­ corporated into the crystal lattice. The unit cell parameters a of Co doped materials are decreased with the augment of Co content but enlarges d spacing (Table S1). The Na-O bond of the Co-doped ma­ terial increases but the TM-O and O-O bonds are shortened, which makes the insertion and de-insertion of Na+ diffusion easier. The shortening of the TM-O bond and O-O bond is beneficial to the structural stability of P2-type materials [27]. Fig. 2d shows the shift of the base peak towards left as the cobalt content improvement, revealing the shrinkage of the TMO2. There is the lattice structure of layered P2 − Na2/3Mn1−xCoxO2 (x = 0,0.1,0.2) (Fig. 2d). The two tran­ sition metals(Co/Mn)are randomly distributed in the MO2 layer on account of the condition that Co3+ (0.545 Å), Co4+ (0.53 Å), and Mn4+ (0.53 Å) have similar ion radii[28,29]. It can be seen from (Table S2-4) that Co is smoothly doped in the transition metal layer. In P2 type structure, sodium ions at the prism site are supposed to pass through the center of a relatively wide plane quadrilateral con­ tributing P2 diffusion barrier that is relatively low, which can show excellent electrochemical performance [30,31]. As shown in Fig. 3a-b, the XRD test was performed on the NM and NCM2 after the 10th, 50th, and 100th cycles. It was found that NCM2 still maintains the original P2 structure after 20 % Co doping, but the pure material NM showed (022) characteristic peak of P2'. The same result has also been confirmed in the research of other Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the preparation process of Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2. C. cheng Fu, J. Wang, Y. Li et al.

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 3 scholars, for example Kumakura [32] and Wang [33]. Therefore, Co can effectively inhibit the occurrence of P2-P2' phase transition, which is conducive to structural stability providing favorable con­ ditions for fast insertion and exsertion of Na+. For the sake of comprehending the morphology and structural characteristics of materials, a series of tests were performed to characterize the material. It can be seen from Fig. 4a-f that the particles of the three materials are all polygonal plate-like struc­ tures, with a particle size of about 1–2 μm, and the thickness of the sheet is within a few nanometers. The results are consistent with the XRD test analysis. The surface of the NM (Fig. 4a, d) material is not smooth, and the agglomeration is relatively obvious. In contrast, the surfaces of NCM1 and NCM2 are smoother and less agglomerated, which are beneficial to augmenting the specific surface area. It is conducive to the active material fully contact with the electrolyte, further accelerating the charge-discharge reaction rate [34]. In contrast, the particle size of NCM2 is uniform along with the layered structure is more clearly visible, the surface is smoother. The flake materials gather together to form some micropores, which is in favor of the full penetration of the electrolyte. In addition, a single uniform form can reduce the powdering of the electrode during the charging and discharging process, which makes for the stability of the structure. To analyze the element distribution in the NCM2 material, a plane scan of the elements was performed on the NCM2. Fig. 4g-k are the corresponding distribution diagrams of O, Na Mn, and Co respectively. It can be seen that the distribution of each element is uniform. It can be seen from Fig. 5a NCM2 presents a flaky structure, which is consistent with the results of the SEM image. In addition, we can find that NCM2 is a layered structure formed by stacking sheet-like structures. This result is consistent with the results ob­ tained by XRD. Fig. 5c is a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) picture. We calculated the interplanar spacing to be 2.48 Å. According to the PDF standard card in XRD (#27–0751), we know that the corresponding crystal plane is (100) plane. By analyzing the structure of the P2 type NCM2 electrode material, it is known that sodium ions diffuse along the two-dimensional plane perpendicular to the (002) plane during the charge and discharge process, and the direction perpendicular to the (002) plane is the (100) plane, that is, sodium Ions diffuse along the (100) plane. Fig. 5d is the electron diffraction pattern performed in the selected area of Fig. 4c. Analysis of the diffraction spots shows that NCM2 is a hex­ agonal material. In order to further explore the composition of element valence states, the material was characterized by XPS measurement. Fig. 6a shows the measured spectra of the three cathode materials. The peaks of P 2p, Mn 2p, Co 2p, Na 1s, and O 1s can be clearly detected, and there is no binding energy peak of other elements. The Mn 2p spectrum shows four peaks in Figs. 6b-d, 641.41 eV and 653.50 eV are Mn3+, and the other two peaks are Mn4+ at 643.0 eV and 654.5 eV [35]. Co 2p also exhibits four peaks, two of which are located at 780.22 eV and 795.20 eV are Co3+, and the other two peaks at 782.33 eV and 797.10 eV are Co4+. From Fig. 6e-f, it can be seen that the Mn3+ in NCM2 is significantly reduced. This is due to the Fig. 4. SEM images show the micromorphology of NM(a,d), NCM1(b,e), and NCM2(c -f). EDS contour (g).

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 4 appropriate stoichiometricCo -doping inhibits the Jahn-Teller effect and the occurrence of phase transitions. But the Co content of NCM1is not enough to achieve the desired effect. Aiming to study the electrochemical properties of Co ion doping, charge and discharge tests were carried out in these cathode materials. Fig. 7a NM shows an obvious voltage plateau around 2.0 V. The appearance of the voltage plateau is accompanied by the oc­ currence of phase distortion [36]. The charge-discharge curve of materials Co doped becomes smoother and the voltage plateau at about 2.0 V disappears during discharge, indicating that Co doping is Fig. 5.

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 5 beneficial to stabilizing the structure and suppressing the P2-P2' phase transition. In addition, the polarization degree during the cycle is relatively few, revealing the reversibility of the material is also elevated [36,37]. Fig. 7d-f reflect the dQ/dV curve of three ma­ terials, NM presents a zigzag-shaped complex peak due to the order of vacancies [38]. However, after Co doping, the curves of NCM1 and NCM2 become smoother (Fig. 7e-f). The redox peaks above 3.0 V is caused by the oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+ followed by two sets of re­ duction peaks around 4.0 V and 2.0 V corresponds to Mn3+/Mn4+ [39,40]. However, With the incorporation of Co, a new peak appears near 2.5 V, which may be derived from Co3+/Co2+ [41]. The cycle performance of the three materials at 0.2 C can be seen in Fig. 8a that the performance is related to the content of Co doping. After 100 cycles of discharge, NCM2, NCM1, and NM remain capacity are 153mAh·g−1, 119mAh·g−1, and 102mAh·g−1 respectively. Com­ pared with NM, the cycle performance of NCM1 is improved, but the generous effect is not achieved. It may be due to insufficient Co doping content. In contrast, the cycle performance of NCM2 is sig­ nificantly improved. This is largely because of that when the Co doping content is relatively enough. Low-state Co ions are doped at the Mn site, which can increase the ratio of Mn4+and reduce the Mn3+ with Jahn-Teller activity [42]. Fig. 8b-c is the charge and dis­ charge curve of NM and NCM2 at 0.2 C rate. It can be seen that NFM has a significant voltage drop at about 1.75 V related to the Mn3+Jahn-Teller effect with the increase of the number of cycles, which has a serious impact on the stability of the lattice structure of the material. After 100 cycles, the coulombic efficiency was 99. 8 %, 99. 3 %, and 98 %, respectively. Co doping improves the coulombic efficiency, which is beneficial to the stability of the structure and makes the insertion and deintercalation of sodium ions smoothly [43]. In terms of electrochemistry and structural reversibility, the high-rate charge-discharge cycle performance in the voltage range of 1.5–4.0 V has been further studied. Fig. 8d is a graph of the cycle performance after 200 cycles at a current density of 2 C. The initial discharge capacity at 2 C rate is 82 mAh·g−1, 98 mAh·g−1, 106 mAh·g−1 respectively. We found that with the increase of current density, the discharge specific capacity of NCM2 is lower than the discharge capacity of 0.2 C. However, the cycle stability of NCM2 after 100 cycles is more prominent, and the capacity retention rate is 88. 7 %. Fig. 8e are the charge and discharge curve of NCM2 when the current density is 2 C. The voltage fade is significantly suppressed for 20 % Co doping in the consecutive cycles. At the end of the discharge, the incorporation of low-priced and high-spin Co2+ makes the average combined state of Mn slightly higher than the level of 3 + , which can well inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and benefit the stability of the structure [41,44]. Fig. 8f is the rate performance graph of the three materials. NCM2 still has a capacity of 137. 5mAh·g−1 when the rate is restored to 0.2 C. NCM2 has excellent rate performance and higher reversibility. The influence of different Co content on the electrode charge transfer kinetics is studied by the AC impedance test (EIS). In Fig. 8g, the diagram is composed of two semicircles, including diagonal lines in the high-frequency region and the low-frequency region. The high-frequency region of the real axis intercept represents the im­ pedance of ohmic resistance and the solution resistance, called Rs. The mid-frequency semicircle represents the charge transfer im­ pedance, called Rct, which is caused by the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode. The low-frequency oblique line re­ presents the impedance of sodium ion diffusion in the electrode, which is called Warburg impedance. The linear part of EIS in the low-frequency region is related to the Na+ diffusion coefficient, and its calculation formula is as follows: = R T A n F C D 2 2 2 2 4 4 2 2 (1) R is the ideal gas constant, R= 8.314 J·mol−1·K−1; T is the absolute temperature, also called Kelvin temperature, if tested at room tem­ perature, T = 298.15 K; A is the electron transfer reaction in each molecule. The number of electrons, the size is 1; F is the Faraday constant, F= 96500 C/mol. C is the concentration of sodium ions in Fig. 7.

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 6 the electrode, the unit is mol/cm3. σ is the Warburg factor, the unit is Ω/s−1/2, and Zre The relationship is as follows: = + + Z R R re s ct 1/2 (2) σ represents the slope of Zre-ω−1/2 linear fitting as shown in Fig. 8h. According to Table 1, all the values of NCM2 are significantly smaller than the other two, and the Rf value is small, indicating that the optimal co-doping can inhibit the decomposition of the elec­ trolyte and reduce the dissolution of Mn2+ in the electrolyte [45]. Compared with the other two materials, the resistance of charge transfer resistance (Rct) has an absolute advantage, indicating that the electrochemical reaction kinetics of NCM2 has been improved. According to the above calculation formula, the Na+ diffusion coef­ ficients of NM, NCM2 and NCM1 samples are 3.43 × 10−13 cm2·s−1, 7.53 × 10−10 cm2·s−1, 1.78 × 10−12 cm2·s−1 respectively. This result shows that the appropriate amount of doped NCM2 material is more conducive to the diffusion of Na+, this is because the crystal structure is stable after Co doping, and the phase change is not easy to occur in the long cycle process so that Na+ can be inserted and extracted quickly. In order to further verify the accuracy of the diffusion coefficient, the GITT test was performed on NM and NCM2 materials, as shown in Fig. 9a-b, the NM electrode DNa + is maintained between 10−12-10−13 cm2·s−1. The NCM2 electrode material DNa + is maintained between 10−9-10−10 cm2·s−1, which is consistent with the previous test results, which proves once again that Co doping effectively improves the interfacial transport performance of sodium ions. The following Table 1 lists the resistance values obtained from the EIS curve. Compared with NM, the Rf value of NCM2 is smaller, in­ dicating that the optimal Co doping can inhibit the decomposition of the electrolyte and reduce the dissolution of Mn2+ in the electrolyte.

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 7 The resistance of NCM2 charge transfer resistance (Rct) has an ab­ solute advantage, suggesting that the electrochemical reaction ki­ netics of NCM2 has been improved [46]. Hard carbon is considered to be the most promising electrode material for sodium-ion batteries on account of its high sodium storage capacity and low sodium storage potential. As shown in Fig. 10a, in order to verify the practicability of the NCM2 electrode material for full cell, NCM2 was used as the cathode material, and hard carbon was used as the anode material in a mass ratio of 1:1.2 to match the full cell (NNCM//HC). The voltage range for the full cell is 1.4–3.9 V. NCM2//HC still has a capacity of 103 mAh g−1 remaining, and the energy density based on the cathode mass energy can reach 254 Wh ·kg−1 at 0.5 C after 200 cycles. The performance of NCM2//HC is outstanding, which is comparable to that of the matched by Zhao et al. [47]. The capacities at 10th, 50th, 100th, 150th, and 200th cycles are 147 mAh g−1, 136 mAh g−1, 124 mAh g−1, 115 mAh g−1, and 103 mAh g−1 respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 10c, after NCM2//HC was tested at different rates of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, and 10 C, the material still had a reversible specific capacity of 137 mAh g−1 when it returned to 0.2 C, NCM2//HC presents highly superior rate per­ formance. In order to probe into the effect of Co doping on the density of states of NM,First-principles calculation was performed. As shown in Fig. S1, NM and NCM2 straddle both sides of the Fermi level, in­ dicating that materials have been equipped with favorable metallic properties. The obvious band gap can be observed in NM, but the band gap is almost non-existent after Co doping, indicating that the electronic conductivity of the material is enhanced after Co doping [48]. More impressively, the DOS of the O 2p orbital aggrandizes near the Fermi level and the redox reaction of oxygen is promoted Fig. 9.

C. cheng Fu, J. Wang, Y. Li et al. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 918 (2022) 165569 8 with the incorporation of Co, providing charge compensation for the corresponding higher voltage region [49]. In addition, manganese ions in NM exist in a mixed configuration of Mn3+ and Mn4+, but Mn3+ occupies the majority. While the proportion of Mn4+(t2 g 3-eg0) increased after Co doping. It is well known that unpaired electrons Mn3+ has strong Jahn-Teller activity, which can lead to lattice structure distortion and charge ordering, thus limiting the inter­ calation and deintercalation of Na+. Therefore, we conclude that the distortion of the Jahn-Teller effect for Mn3+ can be effectively wea­ kened by Co doping. According to the theoretical specific capacity formula ( = Q nF M ), NCM2 corresponds to 0.58 sodium release when charged to 4.0 V. In order to more fully comprehend the electron behavior during char­ ging and discharging, the PDOS are plotted in Fig. 11a-l. When Na is emigrated (Na0.5), the spin orbits of Mn and Co on eg gradually move from the left to the right side of the Fermi level. The shift indicates that Mn3+(t2g 3-eg1) is oxidized to Mn4+(t2 g 3-eg0) combined with Co2+ is oxidized to Co3+, and the charge compensation is provided by Co and Mn together in this process. When charging to Na0.34, the charge compensation of Mn have accomplished, and Co continues to play the compensation role until the end of charging. The electronic structure was further investigated and found that the strong cova­ lency between Co t2 g and O 2p forms an electron-deficient state or \"hole\" in the O 2p orbital, which is beneficial to inhibit the loss of oxygen, thereby improving the structural stability [50]. To further clarify the reason for the excellent rate performance of NCM2. Na+ diffusion of materials was investigated by First principles calcula­ tions using the NEB method. The corresponding Na+ migration bar­ riers of NM and NCM2 are shown in Fig. 11m and Fig. 11n shows the Na+ diffusion paths. Theoretical calculations showed that the ex­ cessive migration barrier of Na+ in NM is about 1.21 eV, which is much higher than that of NCM2 (0.58 eV). The results make clear that the Co-doping modification can promote the diffusion of Na+ and provide facile ion diffusion channels [51]. 4. Conclusions In summary, layered Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2 for SIBs was successfully prepared through the hydrothermal method. Among the many P2 layered materials, we chose the low-cost Mn base transition metal Fig. 11.

The electrochemical stability of Na0.67MnO2 is poor, which is mainly for the sake of Na+ / vacancy along with the slip of the MO2 layer during the process of sodium ion de-intercalation, causing the irreversible phase transition. The po­ sitive effects of Co doping on Na0.67MnO2 were comprehensively characterized by the morphology, crystal structure, and charge sto­ rage mechanism. Co doping at the Mn site increases the proportion of Mn4+ and Jahn-Teller effect distortion is effectively suppressed proven by DFT and XPS tests. Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2 still has 88. 7 % capacity retention rate after 200 cycles at 2 C and the reversibility and cycling stability of the material have been significantly im­ proved proved by tests. Co-doping modification can achieve pre­ ferably cycle stability for sodium ion batteries.

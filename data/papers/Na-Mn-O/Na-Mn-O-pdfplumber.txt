To compare the effect of two improvement strategies for metal oxide cathodes, specifically Codoping and morphology optimization, four representatives of the prominentmaterialclassoflayeredNa MO (M=transitionmetal) x 2 have been studied: hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres of P2− Na MnO and P2−NaCo Mn O . The better electrochemical x 2 x 0.1 0.9 2 performanceofthespheresovertheflakesandoftheCo-dopedover the undoped materials are explained on the basis of structural features revealed by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The higher cycling stability of the material doped with ∼10% Co is attributed to three effects: (i) the suppression of a Jahn−Tellerinduced structural transition from the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombicphasethatisobservedinNaMnO ;(ii)suppressionoforderingprocessesofNa+;and(iii)enhancedNa+kinetics x 2 asrevealedbygalvanostaticintermittenttitrationtechniquemeasurementsandinsituelectrochemicalimpedancemeasurements.

Co-doped spheres combine the advantages of both strategies and exhibit the best cycling stability. ■ INTRODUCTION O-type materials, Na+ is coordinated by oxygen octahedrally, Sodium-ionbatteries(NIBs)havereceivedsignificantattention whereas in P-type materials, the coordination is prismatic. Differences in stacking, i.e., shifts of the layers composed of recently and are considered a viable alternative to the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1−5 NIBs have a cost edge-sharingMO 6 -octahedraagainstoneanother,areindicated by numbers. In a P2-structure, e.g., two layers of MO advantage over LIBs for two main reasons. Na, unlike Li, does 6 octahedra need to be depicted in the unit cell to accurately not alloy with Al in the anodic potential region. Thus, Cu, describe the structure. The first studies on insertion processes which is used as the anodic current collector in LIBs, can be replacedwiththecheaperAlforNIBs.6−8Second,Naresources into these layered oxides have been conducted in the 1980s.12−17 Recently, particularly P2-type materials have are more widespread and abundant than Li-based raw materials.1,9 One of the most promising classes of cathode received considerable interest because of their good commaterials is layered oxides, Na MO (M = transition promise regarding cycling stability and capacity.18−26 In these x 2 metal).10,11 Within this class, there are several dominant subgroups, which are defined on the basis of the coordination Received: November 23, 2015 of the Na-ions between the transition metal−oxygen layers.

Possible reasons for the observed effects are discussed below. Manganese Dissolution. The observed fading prompted us to investigate Mn2+ dissolution from the active materials followingapotentialdisproportionationofMn3+intoMn2+and Mn4+.30,43,44 Calculations on the hypothetical amount of manganese in the electrolyte, assuming that capacity fading is only due to manganese dissolution, show that the respective values (∼10−20 ppm) are significantly above the detection limitsforICP,AAS,andEDS.However,neitherICP,norAAS, nor EDS measurements of the processed and concentrated electrolyte were able to detect dissolved manganese. The Mn detection limit for these methods is ∼1 ppm, so that the amount of dissolved Mn (if any) is <1 ppm. Consequently, a capacity fading of≥1% should be detectable bythese methods if it were resulting from Mn dissolution. Thus, it can be concludedthatmanganesedissolutionhasanegligibleeffecton capacity fading of the P2-type materials presented in this work and cannot explain the differences between the respective materials. StructuralStudies.Inthefollowingsections,thestructural processes as a further cause of the different cycling performances are investigated. NMO Flakes. During discharge (3.8 V−1.5 V), the Na+ content (x) increased from 0.46 to 0.98. The (002) reflection shifts to a higher angle, reflecting a contraction of the unit cell along the c-lattice parameter (Figure 3a). As Na+ inserts between the MnO layers, the negative charges of the oxygen 6 between different layers are screened, which moves the layers closertogether.Theshiftofthe(010)reflectiontolowerangles reflects an expansion of the unit cell along the aand bdirections (Figure 3b). The cause of this is a decrease of the oxidationstateofmanganeseduringdischarge,whichresultsin an expansion of the MnO -octahedra and, therefore, an 6 expansion ofthe a-andb-lattice parameters.18,22 Twodifferent phases can be observed during discharge. Initially, the hexagonal P2-type phase of the pristine material is maintained up to a Na+ loading of ∼0.87. Then, new reflections occur in Figure2.(a)DischargeprofilesofNMOflakesandspheresandNCO the pattern (at 2θ° = 21.3, 23.6, 26.2, 29.6, 37.8, 38.9, 43.1, flakesandspheres forgalvanostatic cyclingat20mAg−1,(b)cycling 45.0; see Figure 4; minor impurity from hydrated phase45,46) stability for cycling at 50 mA g−1, (c) rate test (current rates in mA g−1). a V n . d M b o e r c e o o m ve e r, m an or o e v i e n r t la e p ns o e f u a n r t e i fl l e th ct e io e n nd fro o m f t t h h e e d o i r s i c g h in ar a g l e pa a t t te 1 r . n 5 with a reflection from the newly emerging phase is detectable ordering processes.27,29,40−42 For the curve of the NMO (2θ° ≈ 10.2).

While it is not possible to observe such differences in the FWHM for NMO spheres for the aforementioned reasons, given the similar performance of the materials it is hypothesized that the same strain accommodation ability may also be one of the reasons for superior cycling stability and capacity of NMO spheres as compared to flakes.

While the change of the c37.8, 42.3) and a broadening of the (010) reflection at 2θ° ≈ lattice parameter is similar to that of the NCO flakes, the b22.5 are observed. Moreover, a significant broadening of the lattice parameter, and therefore also the unit cell volume, (002) reflection (2θ° ≈ 10.3) at the end of the discharge is changeslessseverely(Figure3).Thus,thestressonthecrystal visible. The reflections at low sodium content are attributed to structure is reduced as compared to the flakes and the volume a so-called “Z” phase, which represents a structure in which, expansionofthespheres(∼2.3%)whiledischargingfrom3.8− based on the initial P2-type structure, the layers of MnO 6 1.5Visonlyhalfthevolumechangeoftheflakes(∼4.8%).The octahedraareshifted.18,47Eventhoughinsomepublicationsan effect on the structure is exacerbated by the anisotropic OP4 phase is reported,8,21 Talaie et al. modeled this newly expansion of the lattice parameters. As the c-lattice parameter emergingphasewithanO22×2×10supercell,inwhichthe decreases during Na+ insertion, the expansion of the unit cell position of the respective layers was randomized.18 According 2046 DOI:10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04557 Chem.Mater.2016,28,2041−2051 Chemistry of Materials Article interaction between Na+ and the Mn−O layers results in a decrease of the interlayer distance. Over the development of the single P2 phase region, the a/b-lattice parameter does not change significantly, leading to a smaller volume change of the NMO spheres compared to NMO flakes (Figure S3b,c). The occurrence of the P′2 phase is not as clear as for the NMO flakes. The new reflections at 20.8 and 42.3 as well as the broadening around 10.3 2θ° could indicate the P′2 phase. However, a new reflection at 2θ° ≈ 36.8 is not in line with an emerging P′2 phase, which suggests that another new phase is formed. Moreover, the prominent reflections between 2θ° = 23−30,whichareindicativeofaunitcellwiththeCmcmspace group,are absent.Thissuggeststhatthecontribution fromthe P′2 phase is small. Occasionally, impurities from differences in the MnO stacking can occur during synthesis. Nevertheless, a Figure 8.

In this work, we propose an effective strategy by a combination of liquid N2 quenching and aliovalent Liquid N2 quenching doping to get new layered cathode materials. As evidenced by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, time-of-flight Manganese vacancies powder neutron diffraction and solid-state 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the proposed synthesis Solid-state NMR spectroscopy methods allow tuning the transition metal ions vacancies and enhance Mn4þ /Mn3þ redox center of P2-type Mnbased materials. Our results demonstrate that such an optimized structure significantly enhances the deliverable þ capacity, Na mobility and electronic conductivity of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of aliovalent doping elements and different cooling approaches on the long-range structure, local environment and electrochemical performance are comprehensively studied by comparing a wide range of doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4Li, Mg, Al, Fe) materials. The optimized Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 material exhibits a remarkably high initial capacity of 202 mAh g (cid:0)1 among ever reported P2-type layered oxides within 2–4 V, a stable capacity retention of 81% after 600 cycles and outstanding rate capability of the specific capacity up to 122 mAh g (cid:0)1 at 1200 mA g (cid:0)1. 1. Introduction cathode materials fail to fulfill demands of sustainable development [4]. Recently, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted many interests and The rapid development of intelligent and environmental-friendly are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact industrial technology, including smart mobile phone and green electhat sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural tric vehicles, has made rechargeable batteries an indispensable part of abundance than lithium [5,6]. our modern society [1,2]. Among various energy storage systems, In the development of NIBs, cathode is the most critical component lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with superior high energy and power denthat restricts cost and energy density in the full batteries [7,8]. sities performance have accounted for the key position [3]. NevertheComparing to polyanionic and tunnel-type cathodes materials for NIBs, less, the low reserve and uneven distribution of Li resources, and the use layered transition metal oxides (NaxMO2, M 1⁄4 transition metal) are of high-cost and toxicity of Co and Ni as redox center for mostly LIBs extensively studied because of their high theoretical specific capacity * Corresponding author.

Among them, the low-cost Mn-based layered beneficial to enlarging the spacing between the Na layers and stabilize materials are deemed as ideal cathodes for large-scale energy storage. the Na0.67MnO2 structure as demonstrated in our previous work [35]. Two types of stacking structures, O3(ABCABC stacking) and P2(AABB And a small amount of Fe-doping is confirmed to disrupt cations stacking) are frequently observed in most of as-synthesized NaxMnO2 ordering and moderate the transition of P2–O2 phases at high voltage, materials within layered structure materials [10]. In comparison to the thus significantly enhancing cyclability of materials [33,35]. Accord(de)sodiation of O3-type materials via the interstitial tetrahedral sites ingly, an optimized low-cost Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.9O2 material with with relatively higher hopping energy from one octahedral site to both superior capacity and cycle performance is successfully prepared another, the P2-type phase allows a direct migration between adjacent through this synergetic strategy including liquid N2 quenching and þ prismatic sites, thus enabling rapid Na transport and showing better aliovalent doping. applicability [11]. However, the available capacities of P2-type cathode Moreover, a systematic study on the correlation between the elecmaterials are still insufficient yet [12,13]. To address this issue, anionic trochemical properties, long-range structure and local environment redox reaction is introduced as its Li counterpart, which can be triggered including the Mn ions average valence and structural distortion of the to get extra capacity by charging the cells to a higher voltage range of Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4Li þ , Mg2þ , Al3þ and Fe3þ ) materials via doping 4.0–4.5 V vs. Na þ /Na (4.3–4.8 V vs. Li þ /Li). Unfortunately, the cathode and different cooling processes (natural cooling, normal quenching and materials inevitably suffer from electrolyte decomposition, multiple liquid N2 quenching) is further understood by employing exand in-situ phase transition and even oxygen loss at such a high voltage, resulting in synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resoobvious voltage hysteresis and rapid capacity fade [14–17]. In contrast, nance (ss-NMR) and time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF controlling the cut-off voltage lower than 4 V for P2-type cathode can PND). The results clearly reveal the superiority of the liquid N2 effectively eliminate aforementioned shortages and yield a much better quenching treatment, which can totally avoid the formation of TM vacyclability, but the reversible capacity is hardly higher than 175 mAh cancies and increase the atomic occupancy of Mn4þ /Mn3þ redox center, g (cid:0) 1 [18–22]. thus leading to the highest specific capacity, Na þ mobility and electronic Recent investigations have focused on the optimization of the crysconductivity among the prepared samples. Furthermore, the influence of talline/local structures and morphology engineering of NaxMnO2 by doping on the Mn ions average valence, degree of structural distortion adjusting the Na/Mn ratio, sintering temperature, cooling rate and and electrochemical properties is discussed in depth. As a result, our aliovalent doping [20–25], which further determine the electrochemical work poses the most fertile directions in the development of high energy performance. However, the overall performance of the materials is far and stable cycling NIBs cathode materials based on sustainable Mn below our expectation. The understanding of underlying element, and provides an ultrahigh performance and low-cost cathode structure-property relationship of the materials, especially the local material for NIBs. environment including Mn vacancies, is insufficient for obtaining the material with high capacity and long cycle performance.

The high-quality TOF PND data were further tered at 900 �C for 15 h, and then exposed to three different cooling collected to investigate the existence of cations vacancies in the TM processes including natural cooling (NC), quenching (QU) and liquid N2 layers for its highly sensitivity to the distribution of atoms [38].

Of note, liquid N2 quenching method with refinements were performed with GSAS [36] and the results of the rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures ((cid:0) 196 �C) can freeze refined fractional atomic coordinates and atomic occupancy based on the samples immediately, providing much faster cooling rate and O2-free XRD and ND are presented in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively, which condition than normal quenching treatment. ICP-OES is employed to are highly consistent with each other and with low Rwp values. These determine the stoichiometric ratios of NAFMO materials (Table S1), results reveal that the atomic occupancies of TM ions in the NAFMO-NC, which are consistent to the designed composition.

Moreover, all of the prepared materials present a uniform the lowest Mn ions average valence to satisfy the charge balance in distribution of Al, Fe and Mn elements and are shown in the TEM and NAFMO materials, which leads to the unequal Mn–O bonds and orthoEDS mapping results (Fig. S1d-o).

In summary, our above results reveal that the long-range structure structure and even long-range structure.

These spectroscopy was employed, which is highly sensitive to the local and four peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase and electronic environment of target nucleus. Previous works have the decreasing symmetry of crystal lattice, generating diffraction peaks concluded that the characteristic signal of P2 and P2’ phase with at the relatively lower diffraction angle in comparison to the (110), obvious orthorhombic distortion are at around 1250 and 850 ppm, (112), (113) and (114) peaks from P2 phase.

Next, the XRD patterns at variable temperature were performed Moreover, a higher content of paramagnetic Mn ions will cause a for a better understanding of the structure evolution during cooling stronger Fermi-contact interaction around Na þ and thus a large chemiprocess. Specifically, the precursor was firstly heated up to 900 �C for 15 cal shift [40]. The resonance of NAFMO-QU sample locates at a larger h in air, and then slowly cooled down to each temperature point. As chemical shift than that of the NAFMO-NC sample (Fig. 2c), which shown in Fig. S6, the XRD patterns reveal that the material at 900 �C further confirm Mn atomic occupancy of NAFMO-QU is higher than that matches well with the standard patterns of P2’ phase, attributed to the of NAFMO-NC sample. Additionally, the resonance shifts slightly to a low average valence of Mn ions thus leading to an orthorhombic lower chemical shift for the NAFMO-LN sample than NAFMO-QU samdistortion of P2 phase as commented before [29]. As the temperature ple, owing to the much longer Mn–O bonds in orthorhombic distortion decreases, the characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with “y“) of P2’ phase (Fig. 1 and Table S4) and consequently the Fermi-contact interphase are reduced in intensity and they are consecutively shifted to þ action around Na decreased. slightly higher diffraction angles due to the contraction of ab plane.

As the g (cid:0) 1, respectively. Even with the 100 times increase of the current dencooling rate for the prepared materials increases, the following characsity (1200 mA g (cid:0) 1), the capacity retention is up to 60% (122 mAh g (cid:0) 1), teristics of first cycle curves deserve special attention: (i) These three indicating excellent rate capability among the reported high-rate þ samples exhibit smooth charge-discharge profiles, confirming multiple P2-type electrodes.

In addition, the cycle stabilities of the maincreasing of cooling rate, corresponding to the decrease of Mn ions terials are also investigated at different current densities of 12 and 1200 average valence. (iii) The initial discharge capacities are 131, 175 and mA g (cid:0) 1 as shown in Fig. S10 and 4d, respectively. At the current density 202 mAh g (cid:0) 1 for NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN, respecof 12 mA g (cid:0) 1, NAFMO-LN electrode delivers the highest initial discharge tively. They are significantly improved with the accelerating cooling capacity of 202 mAh g (cid:0) 1 and the highest maintained capacity of 198 rate. To the best our knowledge, NAFMO-LN material has shown the mAh g (cid:0) 1 after ten cycles without any electrode modifications. Espehighest initial discharge capacity and specific energy density (~527 Wh cially, the excellent reversibility and negligible voltage change are found kg (cid:0) 1, solely considering the mass of cathode active material) among in the charge-discharge curves of NAFMO-LN electrodes. Due to the reported P2-type sodium oxides materials in the voltage range of excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected 2.0–4.0 V. Furthermore, as the working window is expanded to 1.5–4.5 to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current V (Fig. S8), the capacities delivered by NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and rate of 1200 mA g (cid:0) 1. As shown in Fig. 4d and S11, it also maintains the NAFMO-LN are 210, 224 and 246 mA g (cid:0) 1, respectively, while an initial capacity of 122 mAh g (cid:0) 1 and the long cycling stability is achieved obvious plateau attributing to anionic redox reaction appears at ~4.2 V with the remarkable capacity retentions of 98% after 100 cycles, 95% [17,43,44]. As indicated above, the anionic charge compensation proafter 200 cycles and 81% after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g (cid:0) 1 with ~100% cess usually shows the poor cyclabilities and slow dynamics in both coulombic efficiency during cycling. The plateaus of ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V sodium cathode materials and Li-analogues, so we mainly focus on the are substantial reduction from the comparison dQ/dV curves at low (12 working potential below 4 V. In order to meet the needs of the market of mA g (cid:0) 1) and high (1200 mA g (cid:0) 1) current densities, especially the smart grids, the requirement for the discharge rates of NIBs is much plateau at low voltage which is deemed as the main reason for the cahigher. The rate capabilities were tested by charging at low current and pacity decays due to the notorious Mn3þ Jahn-Teller effects. Ex-situ 23Na discharging at various currents, the same as previous researches [33,35, NMR was further performed to explore the structure evolutions at high 39], and the results are shown in Fig. 4b–c. NAFMO-LN electrode shows current density. As shown in Fig. S12, the P2 phase signal is maintained the highest capacities and stable cyclabilities at each current density, during the whole charge process, and thus the electrode could exhibit Fig. 4.

As shown in by introducting different valence doping element, e.g. the introduction Fig. 5a, the XRD patterns have been divided into four stages to clarify the of Li þ is expected to rise 3 folds molar equivalents of Mn3þ to Mn4þ , and structure evolution process more clearly. The (002), (110), (112), (113) 2 folds for Mg2þ and equal amount for Al3þ . Therefore, and (114) peaks are retained during the whole process, corresponding to Na0.67M0.1Mn0.9O2 (M 1⁄4Li þ , Mg2þ , Al3þ ) and non-doped materials were a quasi-solid-solution reaction rather than typically multiple-phases also prepared via the same synthesis process to further reveal the relatransition reaction according to the previous reports [45,46]. As inditionship between the Mn oxidation state, structure and electrochemical cated above, the prepared electrode is assigned to a P20I phase, which properties. The longand short-range structural information are showed exhibits a slight orthorhombic distortion from P2 phase. At the beginin Fig. 6. The obvious orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase can been ning of charge process, the (020) peak reduces in intensity and shifts to found in non-doped NMO-QU/-LN and Al3þ -doped NAMO-LN samples higher angle, corresponding to the decrease of distortion degree, and a with exhibiting the characteristic signals of P2’ phase in both XRD P2 phase is formed at x 1⁄40.40. Afterwards, a board peak is observed at patterns and ss-NMR spectra. Also, orthorhombic distortion is observed the higher diffraction angle of 9�at the end of charge process, owing to for Mg2þ -doped NMMO-LN sample, just like the above results of þ the formation of small amount of O-type stacking in the P2 structure. As NAFMO-LN sample. While the Li -doped NLMO samples do not show reported by Bruce’s group, this process should be indicated as a “Z” any distortion in both longand short-structure by each cooling treatphase evolved by the intergrowth mechanism, which have been ment. Besides, the full width at half maximum of P2 phase also become mentioned in many P2 compounds, especially those containing Fe3þ narrow continuously with the faster cooling treatment for each prepared [35,47,48]. The formation of “Z” phase is more moderate than O2 phase material. The above results indicate that the orthorhombic distortion at high voltage, as the lattice parameter changes are smaller in magnitends to exist in the materials with low theoretical manganese valence tude and less abrupt, leading to a stable structure and better capacity and TM vacancies can be suppressed for P2 type Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 by the retention [49]. The structural evolution is highly reversible during faster cooling treatment, and then exhibiting a more uniform local discharge. Of note, the (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks of P2 environment. phase maintain in the rest of the discharge process, rather than replaced A comparison of the electrochemical performance of non-doped and by that of typical P2’ phase with high degree of orthorhombic distortion doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials (Li þ , Mg2þ , Al3þ and Fe3þ ) prepared (denoted as P2’ II). As the x equals 0.79, the characteristic signals of P2’ by NC, QU and LN methods is shown in Fig. 6a–e. The initial charge and II phase are presented in both in-situ XRD and ss-NMR (Fig. 5b) results. discharge capacities of all prepared materials increase significantly with However, such a moderate phase transition also makes it hard to the accelerating cooling rate, and the maximum capacity is obtained by distinguish between the P2’ I and P2’ II phase from in-situ XRD liquid N2 quenching (LN) treatment for all samples, demonstrating that results. the rapid cooling treatment can eliminate Mn vacancies, increase redox As shown in Fig. 5b, the local environment information of the eleccenters, and effectively improve the capacity of P2 type Na0.67MxMn1trode materials can be observed through 23Na MAS NMR spectra, since xO2. Moreover, Fig. 7f and S13 show that the cycle stablity of Na þ directly participates in the electrochemical reaction in NIBs. 23Na Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials is highly related to the Mn ions average 1D slices were extracted from 2D projection-MATPASS (pj-MATPASS) valence in the materials except for NAFMO-LN sample, which exhibits NMR spectra to eliminate the sideband signals [50]. Consistent with the optimal electrochemical performance through the synergy effect of Al powder sample, the ss-NMR spectrum of NAFMO-LN pristine electrode and Fe co-doping [32,33]. The lower Mn ions average valence causes also shows the resonance signals at ~1250 ppm and ~0 ppm, rather more severe orthorhombic distortion in Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 and thus being than monoclinic and hydrated phases that usually occur during elecdetrimental to cyclability, e.g. the highest specific capacity (215 mAh trode prepared process, suggesting that P2’ I phase is stable and g (cid:0) 1, 2–4 V) but lowest capacity retention of non-doped NMO-LN structural transitions do not occur during electrode preparing procedure (Mn þ3.33, δ 1⁄45.59%) sample, exhibiting many small plateau in galva[34,51]. During initial charge and discharge processes, the chemical nostatic charge-discharge curves. In contrast, the doped samples exhibit shift of the signal moves to the high and low value gradually, corremuch smoother charge-discharge profiles, which evidences that the spongding to the increase and decrease of the Mn ions average valence, introduction of non-electrochemically active element disrupt the TM þ respectively. The local structural evolution is in good agreement with ordering in the TM layers and hamper Na -vacancy ordering during the results of in situ XRD. When the x 1⁄4 0.32, the amount of local cycling [13]. The 10 mol% of Li-doping material presents a pure P2 environment significantly increases because of the glide of MnO2 layers, phase without any lattice distortion and a stable cycling performance. a wide peak at ~1100 ppm emerges, corresponding to the “Z” phase. However, even with liquid N2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mn þ3.59, Besides, the P2 phase signal can also be observed at the high voltage and δ 1⁄40%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g (cid:0) 1. Theredecrease in intensity with “Z” phase emerging, which further proves the fore, a rational element substitution should be implemented to mitigate formation of “Z” phase is an intermediate and moderate process Jahn-Teller effect and make a balance bewteen the capacity and cycle evolving intergrowth of P2 and O2 phases. The local structure is also stablity to achieve superior electrochemical performance. Thus, the highly reversible in discharge process. In x 1⁄4 0.78, the characteristic optimal co-doped NAFMO-LN material, with moderate initial Mn ions signal of P2’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distinvalence (Mn þ3.39) and slight distortion (δ 1⁄42.91%), shows not only an guished from the signal of P2’ I phase. Besides, the P2’ II phase signal outstanding capacity of 202 mAh g (cid:0) 1 at voltage range of 2–4 V, but also of NAFMO-LN sample is much broader than that of non-doped a satifactory cyclability of 90.4% after 30 cycles at 12 mA g (cid:0) 1.

In summary, our comparative results obtained in Na cells of nondoped and doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 materials with Li þ , Mg2þ , Al3þ and Fe3þ prepared via different cooling processes is verified by using the combination of in-situ synchrotron XRD, TOF PND and ss-NMR measurements. They reveal that a simple liquid N2 quenching treatment 8 X. Liu et al. N a n o E n e r gy76(2020)104997 Fig. 6.

In this work, we propose an effective strategy by a combination of liquid N2 quenching and aliovalent Liquid N2 quenching doping to get new layered cathode materials. As evidenced by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, time-of-flight Manganese vacancies powder neutron diffraction and solid-state 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the proposed synthesis Solid-state NMR spectroscopy methods allow tuning the transition metal ions vacancies and enhance Mn4þ /Mn3þ redox center of P2-type Mnbased materials. Our results demonstrate that such an optimized structure significantly enhances the deliverable þ capacity, Na mobility and electronic conductivity of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of aliovalent doping elements and different cooling approaches on the long-range structure, local environment and electrochemical performance are comprehensively studied by comparing a wide range of doped Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4Li, Mg, Al, Fe) materials. The optimized Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.85O2 material exhibits a remarkably high initial capacity of 202 mAh g (cid:0)1 among ever reported P2-type layered oxides within 2–4 V, a stable capacity retention of 81% after 600 cycles and outstanding rate capability of the specific capacity up to 122 mAh g (cid:0)1 at 1200 mA g (cid:0)1. 1. Introduction cathode materials fail to fulfill demands of sustainable development [4]. Recently, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted many interests and The rapid development of intelligent and environmental-friendly are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact industrial technology, including smart mobile phone and green electhat sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural tric vehicles, has made rechargeable batteries an indispensable part of abundance than lithium [5,6]. our modern society [1,2]. Among various energy storage systems, In the development of NIBs, cathode is the most critical component lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with superior high energy and power denthat restricts cost and energy density in the full batteries [7,8]. sities performance have accounted for the key position [3]. NevertheComparing to polyanionic and tunnel-type cathodes materials for NIBs, less, the low reserve and uneven distribution of Li resources, and the use layered transition metal oxides (NaxMO2, M 1⁄4 transition metal) are of high-cost and toxicity of Co and Ni as redox center for mostly LIBs extensively studied because of their high theoretical specific capacity * Corresponding author.

Among them, the low-cost Mn-based layered beneficial to enlarging the spacing between the Na layers and stabilize materials are deemed as ideal cathodes for large-scale energy storage. the Na0.67MnO2 structure as demonstrated in our previous work [35]. Two types of stacking structures, O3(ABCABC stacking) and P2(AABB And a small amount of Fe-doping is confirmed to disrupt cations stacking) are frequently observed in most of as-synthesized NaxMnO2 ordering and moderate the transition of P2–O2 phases at high voltage, materials within layered structure materials [10]. In comparison to the thus significantly enhancing cyclability of materials [33,35]. Accord(de)sodiation of O3-type materials via the interstitial tetrahedral sites ingly, an optimized low-cost Na0.67Al0.1Fe0.05Mn0.9O2 material with with relatively higher hopping energy from one octahedral site to both superior capacity and cycle performance is successfully prepared another, the P2-type phase allows a direct migration between adjacent through this synergetic strategy including liquid N2 quenching and þ prismatic sites, thus enabling rapid Na transport and showing better aliovalent doping. applicability [11]. However, the available capacities of P2-type cathode Moreover, a systematic study on the correlation between the elecmaterials are still insufficient yet [12,13]. To address this issue, anionic trochemical properties, long-range structure and local environment redox reaction is introduced as its Li counterpart, which can be triggered including the Mn ions average valence and structural distortion of the to get extra capacity by charging the cells to a higher voltage range of Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 (M 1⁄4Li þ , Mg2þ , Al3þ and Fe3þ ) materials via doping 4.0–4.5 V vs. Na þ /Na (4.3–4.8 V vs. Li þ /Li). Unfortunately, the cathode and different cooling processes (natural cooling, normal quenching and materials inevitably suffer from electrolyte decomposition, multiple liquid N2 quenching) is further understood by employing exand in-situ phase transition and even oxygen loss at such a high voltage, resulting in synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resoobvious voltage hysteresis and rapid capacity fade [14–17]. In contrast, nance (ss-NMR) and time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF controlling the cut-off voltage lower than 4 V for P2-type cathode can PND). The results clearly reveal the superiority of the liquid N2 effectively eliminate aforementioned shortages and yield a much better quenching treatment, which can totally avoid the formation of TM vacyclability, but the reversible capacity is hardly higher than 175 mAh cancies and increase the atomic occupancy of Mn4þ /Mn3þ redox center, g (cid:0) 1 [18–22]. thus leading to the highest specific capacity, Na þ mobility and electronic Recent investigations have focused on the optimization of the crysconductivity among the prepared samples. Furthermore, the influence of talline/local structures and morphology engineering of NaxMnO2 by doping on the Mn ions average valence, degree of structural distortion adjusting the Na/Mn ratio, sintering temperature, cooling rate and and electrochemical properties is discussed in depth. As a result, our aliovalent doping [20–25], which further determine the electrochemical work poses the most fertile directions in the development of high energy performance. However, the overall performance of the materials is far and stable cycling NIBs cathode materials based on sustainable Mn below our expectation.

In summary, our above results reveal that the long-range structure structure and even long-range structure.

These spectroscopy was employed, which is highly sensitive to the local and four peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase and electronic environment of target nucleus. Previous works have the decreasing symmetry of crystal lattice, generating diffraction peaks concluded that the characteristic signal of P2 and P2’ phase with at the relatively lower diffraction angle in comparison to the (110), obvious orthorhombic distortion are at around 1250 and 850 ppm, (112), (113) and (114) peaks from P2 phase.

Next, the XRD patterns at variable temperature were performed Moreover, a higher content of paramagnetic Mn ions will cause a for a better understanding of the structure evolution during cooling stronger Fermi-contact interaction around Na þ and thus a large chemiprocess. Specifically, the precursor was firstly heated up to 900 �C for 15 cal shift [40]. The resonance of NAFMO-QU sample locates at a larger h in air, and then slowly cooled down to each temperature point. As chemical shift than that of the NAFMO-NC sample (Fig. 2c), which shown in Fig. S6, the XRD patterns reveal that the material at 900 �C further confirm Mn atomic occupancy of NAFMO-QU is higher than that matches well with the standard patterns of P2’ phase, attributed to the of NAFMO-NC sample. Additionally, the resonance shifts slightly to a low average valence of Mn ions thus leading to an orthorhombic lower chemical shift for the NAFMO-LN sample than NAFMO-QU samdistortion of P2 phase as commented before [29]. As the temperature ple, owing to the much longer Mn–O bonds in orthorhombic distortion decreases, the characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with “y“) of P2’ phase (Fig. 1 and Table S4) and consequently the Fermi-contact interphase are reduced in intensity and they are consecutively shifted to þ action around Na decreased. slightly higher diffraction angles due to the contraction of ab plane.

At the current density 202 mAh g (cid:0) 1 for NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN, respecof 12 mA g (cid:0) 1, NAFMO-LN electrode delivers the highest initial discharge tively. They are significantly improved with the accelerating cooling capacity of 202 mAh g (cid:0) 1 and the highest maintained capacity of 198 rate.

Espehighest initial discharge capacity and specific energy density (~527 Wh cially, the excellent reversibility and negligible voltage change are found kg (cid:0) 1, solely considering the mass of cathode active material) among in the charge-discharge curves of NAFMO-LN electrodes. Due to the reported P2-type sodium oxides materials in the voltage range of excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected 2.0–4.0 V. Furthermore, as the working window is expanded to 1.5–4.5 to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current V (Fig. S8), the capacities delivered by NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and rate of 1200 mA g (cid:0) 1.

As indicated above, the anionic charge compensation proafter 200 cycles and 81% after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g (cid:0) 1 with ~100% cess usually shows the poor cyclabilities and slow dynamics in both coulombic efficiency during cycling. The plateaus of ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V sodium cathode materials and Li-analogues, so we mainly focus on the are substantial reduction from the comparison dQ/dV curves at low (12 working potential below 4 V. In order to meet the needs of the market of mA g (cid:0) 1) and high (1200 mA g (cid:0) 1) current densities, especially the smart grids, the requirement for the discharge rates of NIBs is much plateau at low voltage which is deemed as the main reason for the cahigher.

As inditionship between the Mn oxidation state, structure and electrochemical cated above, the prepared electrode is assigned to a P20I phase, which properties.

Afterwards, a board peak is observed at patterns and ss-NMR spectra. Also, orthorhombic distortion is observed the higher diffraction angle of 9�at the end of charge process, owing to for Mg2þ -doped NMMO-LN sample, just like the above results of þ the formation of small amount of O-type stacking in the P2 structure.

While the Li -doped NLMO samples do not show reported by Bruce’s group, this process should be indicated as a “Z” any distortion in both longand short-structure by each cooling treatphase evolved by the intergrowth mechanism, which have been ment. Besides, the full width at half maximum of P2 phase also become mentioned in many P2 compounds, especially those containing Fe3þ narrow continuously with the faster cooling treatment for each prepared [35,47,48]. The formation of “Z” phase is more moderate than O2 phase material. The above results indicate that the orthorhombic distortion at high voltage, as the lattice parameter changes are smaller in magnitends to exist in the materials with low theoretical manganese valence tude and less abrupt, leading to a stable structure and better capacity and TM vacancies can be suppressed for P2 type Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 by the retention [49].

As the x equals 0.79, the characteristic signals of P2’ by NC, QU and LN methods is shown in Fig. 6a–e. The initial charge and II phase are presented in both in-situ XRD and ss-NMR (Fig. 5b) results. discharge capacities of all prepared materials increase significantly with However, such a moderate phase transition also makes it hard to the accelerating cooling rate, and the maximum capacity is obtained by distinguish between the P2’ I and P2’ II phase from in-situ XRD liquid N2 quenching (LN) treatment for all samples, demonstrating that results. the rapid cooling treatment can eliminate Mn vacancies, increase redox As shown in Fig. 5b, the local environment information of the eleccenters, and effectively improve the capacity of P2 type Na0.67MxMn1trode materials can be observed through 23Na MAS NMR spectra, since xO2.

Consistent with the optimal electrochemical performance through the synergy effect of Al powder sample, the ss-NMR spectrum of NAFMO-LN pristine electrode and Fe co-doping [32,33]. The lower Mn ions average valence causes also shows the resonance signals at ~1250 ppm and ~0 ppm, rather more severe orthorhombic distortion in Na0.67MxMn1-xO2 and thus being than monoclinic and hydrated phases that usually occur during elecdetrimental to cyclability, e.g. the highest specific capacity (215 mAh trode prepared process, suggesting that P2’ I phase is stable and g (cid:0) 1, 2–4 V) but lowest capacity retention of non-doped NMO-LN structural transitions do not occur during electrode preparing procedure (Mn þ3.33, δ 1⁄45.59%) sample, exhibiting many small plateau in galva[34,51].

The 10 mol% of Li-doping material presents a pure P2 environment significantly increases because of the glide of MnO2 layers, phase without any lattice distortion and a stable cycling performance. a wide peak at ~1100 ppm emerges, corresponding to the “Z” phase. However, even with liquid N2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mn þ3.59, Besides, the P2 phase signal can also be observed at the high voltage and δ 1⁄40%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g (cid:0) 1.

By contrast, sodium is currently the fourth-largest element in further processing and optimization of structural stability are of the earth’s crust, and it is cheap. Therefore, sodium ion batteries are great concern. Element doping is generally considered to be an efexpected to replace lithium ion batteries in some specific energy fective measure to reduce the deformation of transition metal layer storage markets, which can alleviate the shortage of lithium respacing and thus improve the reversibility of the structure.

Therefore, Co It can be seen from Fig. 5a NCM2 presents a flaky structure, can effectively inhibit the occurrence of P2-P2' phase transition, which is consistent with the results of the SEM image. In addition, which is conducive to structural stability providing favorable conwe can find that NCM2 is a layered structure formed by stacking ditions for fast insertion and exsertion of Na+. sheet-like structures. This result is consistent with the results obFor the sake of comprehending the morphology and structural tained by XRD. Fig. 5c is a high-resolution transmission electron characteristics of materials, a series of tests were performed to microscope (HRTEM) picture. We calculated the interplanar spacing characterize the material. It can be seen from Fig. 4a-f that the to be 2.48 Å. According to the PDF standard card in XRD (#27–0751), particles of the three materials are all polygonal plate-like strucwe know that the corresponding crystal plane is (100) plane. By tures, with a particle size of about 1–2 μm, and the thickness of the analyzing the structure of the P2 type NCM2 electrode material, it is sheet is within a few nanometers. The results are consistent with the known that sodium ions diffuse along the two-dimensional plane XRD test analysis. The surface of the NM (Fig. 4a, d) material is not perpendicular to the (002) plane during the charge and discharge smooth, and the agglomeration is relatively obvious. In contrast, the process, and the direction perpendicular to the (002) plane is the surfaces of NCM1 and NCM2 are smoother and less agglomerated, (100) plane, that is, sodium Ions diffuse along the (100) plane.

In addition, a single uniform peaks of P 2p, Mn 2p, Co 2p, Na 1s, and O 1s can be clearly detected, form can reduce the powdering of the electrode during the charging and there is no binding energy peak of other elements. The Mn 2p and discharging process, which makes for the stability of the spectrum shows four peaks in Figs. 6b-d, 641.41 eV and 653.50 eV structure. To analyze the element distribution in the NCM2 material, are Mn3+, and the other two peaks are Mn4+ at 643.0 eV and 654.5 eV a plane scan of the elements was performed on the NCM2. Fig. 4g-k [35].

The corresponding dQ/dV diagram of three cathode materials(d-f). beneficial to stabilizing the structure and suppressing the P2-P2' respectively. We found that with the increase of current density, the phase transition. In addition, the polarization degree during the discharge specific capacity of NCM2 is lower than the discharge cycle is relatively few, revealing the reversibility of the material is capacity of 0.2 C. However, the cycle stability of NCM2 after 100 also elevated [36,37]. Fig. 7d-f reflect the dQ/dV curve of three macycles is more prominent, and the capacity retention rate is 88. 7 %. terials, NM presents a zigzag-shaped complex peak due to the order Fig. 8e are the charge and discharge curve of NCM2 when the current of vacancies [38]. However, after Co doping, the curves of NCM1 and density is 2 C. The voltage fade is significantly suppressed for 20 % Co NCM2 become smoother (Fig. 7e-f). The redox peaks above 3.0 V is doping in the consecutive cycles. At the end of the discharge, the caused by the oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+ followed by two sets of reincorporation of low-priced and high-spin Co2+ makes the average duction peaks around 4.0 V and 2.0 V corresponds to Mn3+/Mn4+ combined state of Mn slightly higher than the level of 3 + , which can [39,40]. However, With the incorporation of Co, a new peak appears well inhibit the Jahn-Teller effect and benefit the stability of the near 2.5 V, which may be derived from Co3+/Co2+ [41]. structure [41,44]. Fig. 8f is the rate performance graph of the three The cycle performance of the three materials at 0.2 C can be seen materials. NCM2 still has a capacity of 137. 5mAh·g−1 when the rate in Fig. 8a that the performance is related to the content of Co doping. is restored to 0.2 C. NCM2 has excellent rate performance and higher After 100 cycles of discharge, NCM2, NCM1, and NM remain capacity reversibility. are 153mAh·g−1, 119mAh·g−1, and 102mAh·g−1 respectively. ComThe influence of different Co content on the electrode charge pared with NM, the cycle performance of NCM1 is improved, but the transfer kinetics is studied by the AC impedance test (EIS). In Fig. 8g, generous effect is not achieved. It may be due to insufficient Co the diagram is composed of two semicircles, including diagonal lines doping content. In contrast, the cycle performance of NCM2 is sigin the high-frequency region and the low-frequency region. The nificantly improved. This is largely because of that when the Co high-frequency region of the real axis intercept represents the imdoping content is relatively enough. Low-state Co ions are doped at pedance of ohmic resistance and the solution resistance, called R. s the Mn site, which can increase the ratio of Mn4+and reduce the The mid-frequency semicircle represents the charge transfer imMn3+ with Jahn-Teller activity [42]. Fig. 8b-c is the charge and dispedance, called R , which is caused by the interface between the ct charge curve of NM and NCM2 at 0.2 C rate. It can be seen that NFM electrolyte and the electrode. The low-frequency oblique line rehas a significant voltage drop at about 1.75 V related to the presents the impedance of sodium ion diffusion in the electrode, Mn3+Jahn-Teller effect with the increase of the number of cycles, which is called Warburg impedance. The linear part of EIS in the which has a serious impact on the stability of the lattice structure of low-frequency region is related to the Na+ diffusion coefficient, and the material. After 100 cycles, the coulombic efficiency was 99. 8 %, its calculation formula is as follows: 99. 3 %, and 98 %, respectively. Co doping improves the coulombic R2T2 efficiency, which is beneficial to the stability of the structure and D= 2A2n4F4C2 2 (1) makes the insertion and deintercalation of sodium ions smoothly [43].

According to Table 1, all the values of NCM2 are significantly is stable after Co doping, and the phase change is not easy to occur in smaller than the other two, and the R f value is small, indicating that the long cycle process so that Na+ can be inserted and extracted the optimal co-doping can inhibit the decomposition of the elecquickly. In order to further verify the accuracy of the diffusion trolyte and reduce the dissolution of Mn2+ in the electrolyte [45]. coefficient, the GITT test was performed on NM and NCM2 materials, Compared with the other two materials, the resistance of charge as shown in Fig. 9a-b, the NM electrode D + is maintained between Na transfer resistance (R ct ) has an absolute advantage, indicating that 10−12-10−13 cm2·s−1.

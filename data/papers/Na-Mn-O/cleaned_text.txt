By electrochemically extracting Li from a monoclinic layered Li2MnO3, we prepared Li2−xMnO3 (x = 1.6-1.8) of which the Li-extracted domain has a cubic spinel struc- ture. The reversible discharge and charge capacity of Li2−xMnO3 versus the Na negative electrode initially exceeded 200 mA · h · g−1, suggesting that close to one molar equivalent of Na is inserted in and extracted from the formula unit, Li2−xMnO3. The electrode retains the capacity of 160 mA · h · g−1 after 50 cycles. On the other hand, the Li2−xMnO3 electrode versus the Li negative electrode signiﬁcantly degrades upon cycling. The ex-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) anal- yses revealed that the spinel domain of Li2−xMnO3 retains its crystallographic structure during the Na insertion and extraction, although the crystal signiﬁcantly loses its periodicity when Na is inserted. A numerical simulation of the SR-XRD proﬁle suggests that the Na-inserted Li2−xMnO3 has the periodicity of only one to two unit cells while retaining the spinel structure. XAS revealed that the reversible capacity is found to be dominated by the redox between Mn(III) and Mn(IV) and the Mn-Mn distance signiﬁcantly loses its correlation upon Na-insertion, which is consistent with the broad SR-XRD proﬁle. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Sodium containing Mn-based oxides have become the focus of attraction as a positive electrode material for the sodium ion battery since manganese is an abundant resource and can be considered a low-cost material [1–4]. For example, ˛-NaMnO2 with the mono- clinic structure and P2-type Na0.6MnO2 with the hexagonal layered structure, have high initial reversible capacities of more than 180 and 150 mA · h · g−1, respectively [5,6]. With the reversible capacity of only 90 mA · h · g−1 notwithstanding, Na0.44MnO2 with a tunnel- type structure undergoes many cycles [7]. When Li is inserted in and extracted from lithium manganese oxides (e.g., LiMn2O4, LiMnO2, etc.), the Mn3+ ⇌Mn4+ redox is often accompanied by a crystallographic phase transition, resulting in a poor cycle stability [8]. A monoclinic layered oxide, Li2MnO3, is not an exception; namely, although the initial discharge capac- ity exceeds 250 mA · h · g−1, the material suffers from a signiﬁcant degradation upon cycling caused by the transition into a cubic ∗Corresponding author.

On the other hand, the energetic barrier for such a transition is said to be much higher in the case of Na inser- tion and extraction [10]. If we can reversibly sodiate and desodiate Li2−xMnO3 suppressing its crystallographic transition, we would be able to achieve a high capacity and long cycle-life electrode material for the sodium ion battery. The reaction mechanism and stoichiometry of Li2MnO3 to explain its high reversible capacity is not yet clear and still a contro- versy. For the discussion below, we now mention some presumable reactions, where A typically stands for Li or an alkaline metal, in general. The initial oxidation reaction is allegedly accompanied by oxygen release [11–13], which could be written as, in a complete hypothetical stoichiometry, A2MnIVO3 −→A+ + e−+ MnIVO2 + 1 2 O2. (1) During the subsequent A-reinsertion, the released oxygen is considered to be hardly resumed. The following redox of Mn would be dominant: MnIVO2 + A+ + e−←−AMnIIIO2.

Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 459 In the present study, we prepared Li2−xMnO3 by electrochem- ically extracting Li from Li2MnO3. The electrochemical properties of Li2−xMnO3 were evaluated in a half-cell setup in which Na metal was used as the counter electrode. The crystallographic structure was investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an elec- tron energy-loss spectrometer (EELS). The chemical state and local structure were examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Broad humps in the SR-XRD proﬁle of the sodiated Li2−xMnO3 were numerically simulated to conﬁrm its spinel structure. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Sample preparation A layered manganese oxide, Li2MnO3, as the starting material in this study was prepared by the solid-state reaction between Li2CO3 (Kishida Chemical, purity 98%) and Mn2O3 (Aldrich, purity 99.9%). Li2CO3 and Mn2O3 were mixed by ball-milling in air at the molar ratio of 2:1 for the target composition to be Li:Mn = 2:1. The mixture was calcined in a gold crucible in air for 10 h at 800 ◦C at which we obtained the best qualiﬁed Li2MnO3 sample in the examined temperature range from 400 to 1000 ◦C. The Li-extracted sample, Li2−xMnO3, was prepared by elec- trochemically extracting lithium from the Li2MnO3 as follows (see the next subsection for the electrochemical cell assem- bly). A Li2MnO3/Li cell was ﬁrst galvanostatically charged (i.e., Li extracted or delithiated) to 4.95 V vs. Li+/Li at the current density of 10 mA · g−1, then potentiostatically charged until the total amount of the charge reached 460 mA · h · g−1. The Li2−xMnO3 electrode, removed from the cell, was rinsed several times with dimethyl car- bonate and then reassembled into a Li2−xMnO3/Na cell. The cell was galvanostatically discharged (i.e., Na inserted or sodiated) to 1.5 V vs. Na+/Na at the current density of 10 mA · g−1. 2.2. Electrochemical properties The electrode was prepared by attaching a mixture of the active material (84 wt.%), acetylene black (AB; 8 wt.%) as the conductive additive and polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE; 8 wt.%) as the binder to an aluminum mesh. The total mass of the active material per electrode was about 7-8 mg. Throughout the present study, the electrochemical capacity was expressed in terms of per initial mass of Li2MnO3. The electrode was tested in an IEC R2032 coin-type cell assembled with a sodium or lithium foil counter electrode, a separa- tor (Celgard 2400) and the electrolyte (1 mol · L−1 of LiPF6 or NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate, EC/DEC (1:1 volume ratio). On initial sodiation process, the cell was galvanostatically discharged (i.e., Na inserted or sodiated) at the current density of 10 mA · g−1, until the potential reached 1.5 V vs. Na+/Na, at which it was then potentiostatically discharged until the current density dropped to 1 mA · g−1. Following process, the cell was galvanostat- ically charged and discharged at the current density of 10mA · g−1. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were evaluated using a battery testing system (BLS series, Keisokuki Center). 2.3. Material characterization The crystallographic structures of the samples were character- ized by a laboratory X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku RINT Cu K˛) and by synchrotron radiation XRD (SR-XRD, SPring-8, BL19B2). For the SR-XRD, the samples were placed in a glass capillary with a 0.5 mm outer diameter. The data were collected using a Debye- Scherrer camera with an imaging plate. The wavelength of the X-ray was calibrated to /nm = 0.06995 using CeO2 as the standard material. The diffraction angle, 2, ranged from 5.00 to 78.00◦, for which one scan took 300 s. The precise crystallographic structures of the samples were determined by the Rietveld reﬁnements of the SR-XRD data using the RIETAN-FP program [14]. The molar ratio of Na to Mn (Na/Mn) was evaluated by an inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. The local structure and valence shift of the Mn ion were evaluated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, Rits, BL3). The morphology of the sample pow- ders was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6390 JEOL) and the distribution of the constituent elements was detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The nano structure of the sample powders was observed using a trans- mission electron microscope (TEM, 3000F, JEOL) equipped with an electron energy-loss spectrometer (EELS), by which the chemical state of the elements was measured. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Precursor Li2MnO3 The XRD proﬁle of the precursor, Fig. 1, is quite consistent with that simulated for the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase (PDF #01-084- 1634, space group C2/m). The proﬁle is free of impurity signals, evidence for a successful synthesis. One ﬁnds from the SEM image inset in Fig. 1 that the Li2MnO3 sample is comprised of a mixture of spherical and hexagonal particles of ∼300 nm diameter. 3.2. Sodiation of Li2−xMnO3 Fig. 2 shows the electrochemical potential proﬁles during the initial charge (i.e., delithiation) process of the Li2MnO3/Li cell and during the subsequent discharge (i.e., sodiation) of the Li2−xMnO3/Na cell. This result is compared to that during the discharge process of the Li2−xMnO3/Li cell (i.e., lithiation). The lower abscissa indicates the electrochemical capacity in terms of mA · h · g−1 and the upper one is converted to the molar equivalent (mol eq) of Li or Na in the Li2−xMnO3 by assuming that the observed capacity would purely result from the alkali metal extraction and insertion; namely, 460 mA · h · g−1 corresponds to 2.0 mol eq. The left hand-side ordinate indicates the potential difference refer- enced to Li metal and the right hand-side one to Na metal, in which the numerals of the latter are shifted +0.3 from the former in order to reﬂect the difference in the standard redox potentials of these metals; i.e., −3.0 and −2.7 V vs. NHE for Li and Na, respectively. During the initial delithiation, a potential plateau is observed at around 4.5 V vs. Li+/Li which corresponds to the oxygen release [12]. When the charge capacity of Li2MnO3 reaches 460 mA · h · g−1, Fig. 1. XRD proﬁle and a SEM image of the as-prepared Li2MnO3 precursor. (X-ray: Cu K˛) 460 R.

Electrochemical potential proﬁles of the Li2MnO3 electrode during the ini- tial delithiation (solid line) and the subsequent sodiation (dashed line) or lithiation (solid line). the electrode potential rises to 4.9 V vs. Li+/Li. During the subse- quent sodiation, Li2−xMnO3 is capable of inserting 0.99 mol eq of Na ions (or 238 mA · h · g−1). The fact that the capacity of the lithi- ation exceeds that of the sodiation and the potential of the former is higher than that of the latter even if taking into account the 0.3 V difference in the redox potentials of Li and Na implies that Li+ is more easily inserted into Li2−xMnO3 than Na+, probably due to the smaller ionic radius of the former (0.076 nm) than the latter (0.102 nm). The ICP measurement suggests that 0.96 mol eq of Na is con- tained in the sodiated Li2−xMnO3, which is consistent with the electrochemical capacity observed during the sodiation. However, the ICP measurement also detected 0.2-0.4 mol eq of Li residing in the Li2−xMnO3 both before and after the sodiation (i.e., x = 1.6 −1.8), which is at odds with the initial delithiation capacity. We sus- pect that certain side reactions, such as the decomposition of the electrolyte at a higher potential, may be involved in the ini- tial delithiation process. The residual Li-containing phase is also detected by TEM and SR-XRD as shown below. As for the structure of the sodiated Li2−xMnO3, see the “TEM and EELS observation” and its subsequent sections. 3.3. Electrode performance Fig. 3 compares the charge and discharge proﬁles of the cells, Li2−xMnO3/Li (LMO) and Li2−xMnO3/Na (NMO). Initially, the reversible capacity of the LMO exceeds that of the NMO. However, after more than 30 cycles, the capacity of the NMO surpasses that of the LMO. The slope of the charge and discharge proﬁles of the LMO becomes steeper than that of the NMO upon cycling, espe- cially above 3.5 V vs. Li+/Li or 3.2 V vs. Na+/Na, implying more serious damage in the LMO than in the NMO. The cycle trends in the discharge capacity of the LMO and NMO are compared in Fig. 4. The potential range of the cycle test was set to 2.5-4.5 V vs. Li+/Li for the LMO and 1.5-4.2 V vs. Na+/Na for the NMO, so that the ﬁrst discharge capacities of both the LMO and NMO are around 250 mA · h · g−1. Although the LMO enjoys a higher capacity than the NMO during the initial ten cycles, its capacity signiﬁcantly decays to less than 100 mA · h · g−1 in the following ten cycles. On the other hand, the NMO retains about 85% of the second discharge capacity observed during the second cycle after 50cycles, i.e.„ 160 mA · h · g−1. Fig. 3. Charge and discharge proﬁles of the Li2−xMnO3-electrodes versus (a) Li (LMO) and (b) Na (NMO). The coulombic efﬁciency of the NMO maintains more than 98- 99% after a few initial cycles, while that of the LMO drops to less than 90%. This suggests that the large structural distortion due to the Mn migration during the cycling is severer for Li insertion and extraction than for Na. 3.4.

TEM observation of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) Li2−xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2−xMnO3. Top: real-space images, Middle: diffraction patterns from a domain in which residual Li was observed after delithiation and Bottom: diffraction patterns from a domain which was completely delithiated. as-prepared Li2MnO3 is reﬂected in its ﬁne diffraction spots, which are well assigned to the space group C2/m, consistent with Fig. 1. In the particles after the delithiation, Li2−xMnO3, Fig. 5(b), we found two domains distinguishable by their diffraction patterns, one of which is attributable to the zone axis [112] of the spinel structure (space group Fd¯3m), Fig. 5(b-1), and the other to [001] of C2/m, Fig. 5(b-2). The spinel domain should be the unreacted Li2MnO3 since the inter-planar spacing calculated from the diffraction spots coincides with that from the electron diffraction simulated from the structural model of Li2MnO3 [15]. The Fd¯3m domain is consid- ered to be the reacted (i.e., delithiated) phase which has a spinel structure, i.e., -MnO2. The presence of the Li residue is consistent with the ICP mea- surement mentioned in the section “Sodiation of Li2−xMnO3”. The arrangement of the oxygen atoms in the [112] plane of Fd¯3m resem- bles that in the [001] plane of C2/m, suggesting that the interface between these two phases is coherent [16]. After the sodiation, Fig. 5(c), while the unreacted C2/m phase retains its space group and lattice constant intact, the diffraction spots from the Fd¯3m domain signiﬁcantly change. The following detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that this sodiated domain is not a layered structure, but remains to be a spinel structure, although it may be tetragonally distorted. The six diffraction spots marked with circles in Fig. 5(c-2) nearly form a regular hexagon, giving the inter-planar distance (d-spacing) of 0.149-0.152 nm. Were the sodiated domain the layered structure of C2/m space group, i.e., layered ˛-NaMnO2, Fig. 5(c-2) should be along the zone axis [001] and the six spots should correspond to the Miller indices of ± 2 ±2 0 and ±4 0 0, respectively. However, the experimentally observed d-spacing of layered ˛-NaMnO2 of these planes is 0.13 nm [22], which is inconsistent with the present result. In other words, in order for the corresponding d-spacing of the layered structure to be 0.149-0.152 nm, the Mn-O distance should be 0.22-0.26 nm, which is unlikely long by considering their Shannon radii. Another possibility is that the sodiated domain remains to be a spinel. If the six spots precisely form a regular hexagon, the phase is a cubic spinel (e.g., Fd¯3m), while if it is irregular, the phase is considered tetragonally distorted (e.g., I41/amd). The blur spots, however, do not allow us to decisively state that the 3% difference between 0.149 and 0.152 nm is signiﬁcant. We proceed the analysis by adopting the lower-symmetry space group of I41/amd, which is consistent with the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn(III). In this interpretation, Fig. 5(c-2) is considered along the zone axis [201] of I41/amd and the Miller indices of the six spots correspond to 040, 0¯40, 22¯4, ¯2¯24, 2¯2¯4 and ¯224 respectively, yielding the lattice constants a/nm=0.595 and c/nm = 0.8671. Incidentally, the 3% of distortion of the present material, if any, is smaller than that of Li2MnIII 2 O4 (7%), for which we suspect the reason is that the defects in the Mn site observed by EELS below absorb the Jahn-Teller distortion. By the sodiation, the lattice of the spinel phase expands by 18% in the volume which is much larger than that of other Na inserting materials with layered structures [17]. Therefore, we consider that the spinel to layer tran- sition of -MnO2 has not occurred during sodiation in this study. Fig. 6 shows the electron energy loss spectra (EELS) of (a) the delithiated (reacted) domain in Li2−xMnO3 and (b) the sodiated domain after the sodiation of Li2−xMnO3. The spectra from the unre- acted Li-residing domains (not shown) were used as a reference of Li2MnO3. The binding energy of the Na L-edge, ca. 38 eV, is reﬂected in the increase in the shoulder over the background after the sodia- tion. A small peak at around ca. 38 eV in Fig. 6(b), which corresponds 462 R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 Fig. 6.

However, EELS detects the sig- nal from several tens nanometers region, so that the proﬁle may contain the signal from the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain. While no shift was observed in the oxygen K-edge, the manganese L-edge shifted to a lower binding energy after the sodiation, reﬂecting the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ as in reaction (2). The molar ratios of oxygen to manganese (O/Mn) was semi- quantitatively evaluated by comparing the peak areas of the O K-edge and Mn L-edge for each of which the integration ranges were from 550 to 555 eV and from 635 to 670 eV, respectively. To cancel out the intensity drift, the two signals (O K and Mn L) were simulta- neously recorded. Normalizing the peak area ratio observed in the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain to 3.0, we found O/Mn to be 2.4-2.5 in the delithiated domain of Li2−xMnO3; i.e., the initial delithia- tion is accompanied by 0.5-0.6 mol eq of the release oxygen (cf. the reaction (1)) [16]. The O/Mn ratio after sodiation is 2.5-2.7 in the reacted domain, which barely shifted from that before the sodiation. The oxygen uptake reported by Tabuchi et al. [21] during the lithiation of Li1+x(Fe0.25Mn0.75)O2 was not observed1. The fact that O/Mn ratio exceeds 2.0 suggests the Mn sites in the reacting domain abound in defects. These Mn defects might have prohibited the spinel phase from returning to the layered structure in contrast to what is observed by Yabuuchi et al. [23] in which a partial transition from spinel to layer is reported in a Na cell using LiMn2O4. 3.5. Synchrotron XRD The crystallographic change before and after the sodiation was investigated using ex-situ SR-XRD. Fig. 7 shows the SR-XRD patterns of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) delithiated Li2−xMnO3 and (c) sodi- ated Li2−xMnO3. The initial sharp peaks of the as-prepared Li2MnO3 belong to the C2/m transitions to the Fd¯3m spinel structure, so called -MnO2, with a slight broadening of the peaks after the delithiation. The peak broadening would ascribed to the structural distortion of -MnO2 since the O/Mn ratio of Li2−xMnO3 is esti- mated to be more than 2.0 indicating that there has some defects in the Mn site of -MnO2 structure. One also notices that a small amount of unreacted Li2MnO3 remains after the delithiation. These results agree with our TEM observation. Yan et al. observe a gradual structural change from C2/m to Fd¯3m during the lithium 1 Strictly speaking, this result stipulates that the chemical formula of Li2−xMnO3 be written as “Li2−xMnOy where y = 2.4 ∼2.6”, etc., which we avoid for simplicity.

(/nm = 0.06995) extraction and insertion cycling of LiMnO2 [16], which is in con- trast to our result of one-step transition to Fd¯3m through the Li extraction. We speculate that the greater amount of Li extraction during the ﬁrst charge process in our study than Yan’s (i.e., 460 vs. about 100 mA · h · g−1) invokes the more drastical phase change in the former than in the latter. No peak shift was observed between the as-prepared Li2MnO3 and the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain of Li2−xMnO3, suggesting that the delithiation is biphasic as Yu et al. reported [11]. The mass frac- tion of the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase in Li2−xMnO3 is evaluated to be about 30 wt.% by the Rietveld reﬁnement of the SR-XRD pro- ﬁle. Assuming the spinel phase to be MnO2, one ﬁnds from this mass fraction that the molar ratio of Li to Mn in the entire delithi- ated sample to be 0.38, which is in good agreement with the ICP measurement (Li / Mn = 0.45). After the sodiation of Li2−xMnO3, very broad humps show up, with the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase remaining. The TEM diffraction spots from the reacted domain (Fig. 5(c)) suggest that the humps stem from the completely sodiated phase, NaMnO2, having the spinel structure, yet its crystalline periodicity is considerably lost. In general, the crystallite size is estimated from the peak widths of the XRD based on the Scherrer equation. However, the humps in Fig. 7(c) are so broad that the equation does not exactly apply. We then directly calculated in the real spaces from the diffrac- tion proﬁle of one crystallite particle without any periodic condition as follows. The intensity, I, of the X-ray (wavelength = ) diffracted at the angle  from the atoms situated at ⃗ri and ⃗rj is: |I()|2 ∝  i  j>i fj() exp 2i⃗K ·  ⃗rj −⃗ri  (3) where fj is the atomic scattering factor of the atom j, and ⃗K is the scattering vector of which the magnitude is: |⃗K| = 2 sin   . (4) Fig. 9 shows the simulated pattern in which superimposed are two proﬁles of the spinel NaMnO2 with 0.4 and 1.6 nm sizes, or several unit cells. The structure model is given in Fig. 8 and Table 1 with the lattice constant a/nm=0.595 and c/nm = 0.8671 based on the TEM diffraction described above. Note that we don’t consider the presence of the Li ion in the structure. The coordinates of the oxygen atom are ﬁxed based on the EXAFS result (see the next section). The simulated proﬁle well reproduces the experimental result. The delithiated domain of Li2−xMnO3 retains its spinel structure after sodiation, but loses its crystallinity R.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Figs. 10(b) and (c) show the XANES and EXAFS spectra of the Mn K-edge, respectively, taken at the states indicated by the num- bers 1-4 in the potential proﬁle, Fig. 10(a).

In the case of lithium manganese oxide in general, the shift to the lower binding energy of the Mn pre-edge indicates the reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(III), which Fig. 10.

Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 distorts the initially centro-symmetric MnO6 octahedron due to the Jahn-Teller effect [18,19]. In the present material, the sodiation triggers a similar distortion in the structure, resulting in the broad humps in the SR-XRD proﬁle. Fig 10 (c) shows the radial correlation, , as a function of the dis- tance from Mn, R, derived from the EXAFS spectra taken at points (2), (3) and (4) in Fig 10(a). The ﬁrst peak in  centering at R/nm = 0.15 is attributed to the Mn-O distance. The peak shape does not apparently change after sodiation. The distortion in the MnO6 octa- hedron after the sodiation inferred from the XANES spectrum may be too subtle to be reﬂected in the peak shape of 2. The second peak in  at R/nm = 0.2-0.3 corresponds to the Mn-Mn distance. The intensity of this peak signiﬁcantly decreases during the sodia- tion, suggesting a signiﬁcant loss in the crystallographic regularity. This observation is also consistent with the analysis described in the section “SR-XRD”. The Mn-Mn peak intensity increases when the sodiated sample is desodiated again, implying that the regularity is reinstated to some extent. 3.7. Structural change and cycle-life stability When Li2−xMnO3 is cycled in the Li-system, its structure shut- tles between the spinel- and layer-type. During this transition, Mn is prone to migrate from the initial octahedral site to the tetrahe- dral site, which clogs the Li diffusion in the electrode, resulting in the poor cycle-stability [9]. On the other hand, the present study proved that Li2−xMnO3 retains the spinel structure in the Na-system, although its crystallographic regularity is signiﬁcantly lost when sodiated. In case of AMnO2, the layer structure is retained during the redox reaction when A = Na, resulting in a good cycle sta- bility [5], whereas a quick degradation is observed when A = Li [20]. Whether the spinel- or layer-structure, the poor stability results from the Mn-migration triggered by the structural phase transi- tion. A computational study by Reed et al. indeed suggests that the Mn-migration to the tetrahedral sites is energetically unfavorable compared to the Li counterpart due to the difference in the ionic sizes [10]. The better cycle stability of Li2−xMnO3 in Na than in Li is presumably achieved by preventing the Mn-migration. 4. Conclusion A spinel manganese oxide, Li2−xMnO3, was synthesized by elec- trochemically extracting Li from Li2MnO3, intending to use it as a positive electrode material for the Na-ion battery. The initial discharge capacity of Li2−xMnO3 exceeded 230 mA · h · g−1, corre- sponding to more than 1.0 mol eq of Na insertion. The discharge capacity remained more than 80% of that observed for the second cycle after 50 cycles. This cycle-stability is superior to the case when Li2−xMnO3 was used in the Li-system. The TEM observation and SR- XRD analysis revealed that the material retained its initial spinel structure during the sodiation and desodiation, although the crys- tallographic regularity was signiﬁcantly lost during the sodiation. Whether the structural phase transition takes place or not during the redox reaction can be a key for the long cycle-life.

To compare the effect of two improvement strategies for metal oxide cathodes, specifically Codoping and morphology optimization, four representatives of the prominent material class of layered NaxMO2 (M = transition metal) have been studied: hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres of P2- NaxMnO2 and P2-NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2. The better electrochemical performance of the spheres over the flakes and of the Co-doped over the undoped materials are explained on the basis of structural features revealed by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The higher cycling stability of the material doped with ∼10% Co is attributed to three effects: (i) the suppression of a Jahn-Tellerinduced structural transition from the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombic phase that is observed in NaxMnO2; (ii) suppression of ordering processes of Na+; and (iii) enhanced Na+ kinetics as revealed by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique measurements and in situ electrochemical impedance measurements. Increased capacity and cycling stability of spheres over flakes may be related to smaller changes of the unit cell volume of spheres and thus to reduced structural stress. Co-doped spheres combine the advantages of both strategies and exhibit the best cycling stability. ■ INTRODUCTION Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have received significant attention recently and are considered a viable alternative to the ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1–5 NIBs have a cost advantage over LIBs for two main reasons. Na, unlike Li, does not alloy with Al in the anodic potential region. Thus, Cu, which is used as the anodic current collector in LIBs, can be replaced with the cheaper Al for NIBs.6–8 Second, Na resources are more widespread and abundant than Li-based raw materials.1,9 One of the most promising classes of cathode materials is layered oxides, NaxMO2 (M = transition metal).10,11 Within this class, there are several dominant subgroups, which are defined on the basis of the coordination of the Na-ions between the transition metal-oxygen layers. Following the nomenclature introduced by Delmas et al.,12 in O-type materials, Na+ is coordinated by oxygen octahedrally, whereas in P-type materials, the coordination is prismatic. Differences in stacking, i.e., shifts of the layers composed of edge-sharing MO6 -octahedra against one another, are indicated by numbers. In a P2-structure, e.g., two layers of MO6 octahedra need to be depicted in the unit cell to accurately describe the structure. Thefirst studies on insertion processes into these layered oxides have been conducted in the 1980s.12–17 Recently, particularly P 2-type materials have received considerable interest because of their good compromise regarding cycling stability and capacity.18–26 In these promise regarding cycling stability and capacity.18–26 In these 2041 DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 studies, the predominant transition metal (typically Mn) was partially substituted by other metals. The variety in terms of composition is immense and is the result of attempts tofinetune certain characteristics such as cycling stability, operating potential, capacity, or cost. Thus, understanding the effect of those different transition metals is key to further develop and optimize P2-type layered oxides as cathodes for NIBs. Ni, for example, is employed due to its high redox potential, which elevates the average discharge potential, and thus energy density, of the material.11,24,27 Co in Mn/Co-based layered oxides is an interesting substitution option as Co improves cyclability.28–30 Interestingly, Co is reduced and oxidized in parallel to Mn over the course of cycling.31 Increased cycling stability was also obtained by incorporating Fe.8,11 Fe-doping suppresses minor structural transitions during cycling and concomitant Na+ ordering processes and thus increases capacity retention. Mg both stabilizes the structure by suppressing a structural distortion toward an orthorhombic phase and leads to a smoothening of the charge/discharge curves. However, this is achieved at the expense of capacity. Several combinations of the aforementioned (transition) metals have been reported in attempts to combine the respective advantages.20,32,33 In this report, we focus on better understanding two improvement strategies on the basic P2 -NaxMnO2+z structure, namely, substitution of manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% and morphology optimization. It was shown by our group before that substituting 11% of Mn with Co in the P2-NaxMnO2+z structure suppresses Na+ ordering and leads to an increase of cycling stability.29 The underlying structural causes are the focus of this publication. Another in fluencing factor for NIB performance is the synthetic route. Synthesis conditions a ffect the amount of defects in the structure,32,34 the morphology,35 and long-range order. We found previously that hollow spheres achieve higher capacity and a better cycling performance thanflakes due to less severe morphological degradation over cycling. 35 This prompted us to look into the structural aspects of this difference. In this work, the e ffect of Co-doping and morphology optimization are investigated using operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Manganese dissolution was shown to have a negligible effect on capacity fading using various analytical techniques. It is shown that for P2NaxMnO2+z flakes a two phase region evolves during discharge. Substituting 10% of the Mn with Co suppresses both Na+ ordering processes and the transition of the initial hexagonal to an orthorhombic phase. These effects are identified as possible causes for improved cycling performance. Moreover, it is shown that the enhanced conductivity adds to the positive influence of a minor substitution of Mn with Co. Enhanced cycling performance of the spherical over the flake-like morphology is attributed to smaller changes of the volume of the unit cell during cycling for the spheres. Finally, both approaches were combined in the synthesis of spherical P2Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9MnO2, which shows a significant improvement in cycling stability. Thus, the advantage of a variation of a previously investigated optimization strategy, doping, and a novel promising approach, spherical morphologies, were demonstrated. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis and Coin Cell Preparation.NaxMnO2+z (NMO) and NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2+z (NCO) flakes were synthesized by combustion synthesis as described previously. 29,36–38 NaNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and Mn(CH 3COO)2 (Alfa Aesar, anhydrous, 98%) were mixed (molar ratio Na:Mn = 0.7) and subsequently dissolved in deionized water. For NCO, additional Co(NO3)2 was added, such that the molar ratio of Na:Co:Mn was 0.7:0.1:0.9. Concentrated HNO3 mixed (molar ratio Na:Mn = 0.7) and subsequently dissolved in deionized water. For NCO, additional Co(NO3)2 was added, such that the molar ratio of Na:Co:Mn was 0.7:0.1:0.9. Concentrated HNO3 (≥69%, Honeywell) was added, followed by 1.5 g of gelatin. The solution was heated until spontaneous combustion occurred. The resulting dark brownish powder was annealed at 800 °C for 4 h, followed by another step at 610°C for 9 h and quenching to room temperature. Elemental composition, as determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), was Na0.6MnO2+z for the NMO flakes and Na0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+z for the NCO flakes; “z” in the above-mentioned formula units accounts for Mn-vacancies and is typically between 0.05 and 0.25 for the P2 phase.13 Spherical NMO was synthesized as reported previously, with a slightly modified annealing procedure.35 NH4HCO3 was dissolved in deionized water, followed by a dropwise addition of ethanol (10% volume of the NH4HCO3 solution) and a solution of MnSO4 in deionized water. To form spherical MnCO3, the solution was stirred at room temperature. After filtration and subsequent washing, the product was annealed in air at 400°C for 5 h to form MnO2. Then, it was dispersed in a solution of NaOH in deionized water and ethanol. Next, both water and ethanol were evaporated, and the residue was first annealed at 320°C in air for 3 h, followed by an annealing step in air at 800 °C for 4 h and an additional step at 610°C for 9 h and finally by quenching to room temperature. Chemical composition according to ICP-OES was Na0.7MnO2+z. For NCO spheres the same process was employed; however, CoSO4 was added to the MnSO4 solution to achieve a 10% ratio of cobalt in the final product. Chemical composition according to ICP-OES was Na 0.6Co0.1Mn0.9O2+z.A s shown previously,35 the surface area of flakes and spheres as measured by BET is∼5m² g-1 for both materials. Coin cells (2016) were prepared with metallic sodium as the negative electrode, and a composite cathode made from active material, acetylene black (Alfa Aesar, >99%), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Arkema, Kynar HSV 900) with a weight ratio 6:2:2 coated on aluminum foil. Glass fiber (Whatman) was used as a separator. The electrolyte was a 1 M solution of NaClO4 (SigmaAldrich, ≥98%) in a mixture of propylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.7%) and ethylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) with a weight ratio of 1:1. Synchrotronoperando XRD was performed with 2016 coin cells with a 3 mm hole drilled through the casing. Subsequently, they were sealed by Kapton foil with a thickness of 25μm and epoxy resin. A Na-metal ring was used as anode (Ø = 16 mm, hole = 3 mm in diameter). To ensure a sufficient amount of active material in the beam’s path a pellet was prepared (∼10 mg active material) with teflonized acetylene black as binder and acetylene black (weight ratio 6:2:2), which was then pressed onto aluminum foil. Physical Characterization. Synchrotron XRD measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (beamline 11–3) using an X-ray energy of 12.7 keV (wavelengthλ = 0.974 Å) and a MAR345 image plate detector (Rayonix). The sample-detector distance was 166.9 mm, enabling collection of data in the scattering vector (q) range of 0.45–5.00 Å-1, where q =( 4π sin θ)/λ, λ is the X-ray wavelength, andθ is the Bragg angle. The 2D diffraction data was reduced to 1D and converted to 2θ° using the GSAS2 software for better comparability.39 In this work, structural developments are depicted for thefirst discharge (Figures 3–8). All observed changes of the lattice parameters and structural transitions were found to be reversible in the subsequent charge. Alloperando measurements were conducted between 3.8–1.5 V vs Na |Na+.A Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (100 mA, 45 kV) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54 Å) was used for laboratory scale powder XRD measurements in reflection mode. The PDXL software (Rigaku) Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (100 mA, 45 kV) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54 Å) was used for laboratory scale powder XRD measurements in reflection mode. The PDXL software (Rigaku) was used for the Rietveld refinement, the whole patternfit (Pawley fit), and the Debye -Scherrer method. Field emission scanning Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2042 electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed using a Zeiss Supra 55 FESEM. A Dual-view Optima 5300 DV system was used for ICP-OES. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100. For the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) a Varian SpectrAA 220FS spectrometer was used. Electrochemistry. Galvanostatic cycling was performed on a Neware battery tester system in a coin cell setup. Galvanostatic cycling for theoperando XRD was conducted on a MTI CT-3008W-5 V1 mAS1 instrument. It should be noted that during the initial charge process for the NCO spheres an interruption in the operando experiment occurred due to technical difficulties. In typical coin cell tests, Codoped and undoped spheres show similar initial capacities (Figure 2). GITT was performed on a Biologic VMP3 potentiostat. A constant current pulse of 50 mA was applied for 200 s, followed by an OCV relaxation period of 5 h. When the voltage changed by less than 2 mV h-1 the next current pulse was applied. The data was analyzed usingeq 1 for the diffusion coefficient, π= δ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥() () D iV zF S 4 E d E dt m A 2 d d 2 (1) where Vm is the molar volume of the unit cell,I is the applied current, zA is the charge number,F is Faraday’s constant, S is the electrode/ electrolyte contact area (approximated as the geometric surface area of the electrode), δ Ed d is the slope of the Coulometric titration curve, and E t d d is the slope of the linearized plot of the potentialE during the current pulse. Volume changes during the cycling process were neglected, as the diffusion coefficient changes significantly (several orders of magnitude), whereas the unit cell volume only changes by several percent.In situ EIS was performed at various potentials on a BioLogic VMP 3 with the EC-lab software in a 3-electrode glass cell setup, using Na-metal as counter and reference electrode, and the active material (composite cathode) as working electrode. After charging/discharging to the respective voltage (at 50 mA g-1) the potential was kept for 30 min, followed by a relaxation step of 2 h and the impedance measurement in OCV mode. The impedancefit was conducted using the Z Fit function of the EC-lab software. Manganese Dissolution Analysis. For the manganese dissolution tests a beaker cell (7.5 mL) was constructed. The cathode was the active material composite coated on aluminum foil (50× 20 mm) covering the complete inner wall of the beaker. Relatively large amounts (∼15 mg) of the active material, specifically NMO flakes, which show the highest capacity fading, were employed to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The anode was an aluminum wire covered with Na-metal, which wasfixed in the center of the cell. Two layers of glassfiber separator were placed between anode and cathode to prevent short circuiting. After adding 6.0 mL of electrolyte the cell was sealed and operated between 10 and 40 cycles. Afterward, the metallic sodium was dissolved in pure ethanol and all cell parts were rinsed with ethanol and combined with the extracted electrolyte. For EDS the solution was heated (120°C) on a copper foil until a dry black powder was obtained. For ICP the solution was acidified and the majority of the organic parts were oxidized under heating. Afterward, the solution wasfilled to a specific volume with deionized water in a calibrated flask. For AAS the solution could be used as is after further dilution. Assuming all capacity loss is attributed to Mn dissolution, the concentrations should be 22 ppm (ICP) and 10 ppm (AAS) in the analysis sample, respectively. ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physical Characterization.The crystal structure of the asprepared NMO flakes and hollow spheres as well as NCO flakes and hollow spheres was identified to have a hexagonal unit cell of the P2-type class (space groupP63/mmc, Figure S1). For all materials, the lattice parameters were found to be approximatelya = b ≈ 2.87 Å andc ≈ 11.1 Å (for exact values unit cell of the P2-type class (space groupP63/mmc, Figure S1). For all materials, the lattice parameters were found to be approximatelya = b ≈ 2.87 Å andc ≈ 11.1 Å (for exact values see Table S1). The difference in the lattice parameters of the initial NMO and NCO can be explained by a contraction of the lattice induced by cobalt.28 For NMO spheres the differences in the lattice as compared to NMOflakes is due to an initially higher Na+ content of the spheres. The difference of the lattice parameters between NCO flakes and NCO spheres is negligible. The (hkl) re flections of the hollow spheres are broader than the flakes’, as can be seen exemplarily for the most intense re flection (002), which has a full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of 2θ° = 0.30 for the NMO spheres and 0.12° for the NMO flakes. Paulsen et al.28 indicated that the employed short annealing time can lead to stacking faults or inhomogeneities of the Na+ distribution, which would explain the breadth of the reflections of the spheres. In addition, the flakes had crystallographic texture and, thus, a thorough Rietveld refinement for the operando data is challenging and beyond the scope of this publication. Phases were identified using the Pawley approach tofit the whole pattern; for powder material of both NMO and NCOflakes a Rietveld refinement was employed (International Crystal Structure Database, ICSD50301). For a comparison of the differences in crystallite size between flakes and spheres the Debye-Scherrer method was applied to both Co-doped versions as they are more crystalline than the undoped analogues. According to the Debye-Scherrer analysis, the NCO flakes have an average crystallite size of 605 nm whereas for the NCO spheres the respective size is 345 nm. As can be seen inFigure 1 the size of the flakes is on the order of micrometers. However, considering the limitations of the Debye-Scherrer equation (e.g., value of the shape factor), it cannot be excluded that the flakes are single crystals. The flakes’ diameter and thickness vary (Figure 1a). The hollow spheres have an outer diameter of approximately 5μm, and their outer shells are built up of hexagonal layered flakes (Figure 1b). The shell thickness is comparable to the thickness of the synthesizedflakes. Electrochemical Studies.For the galvanostatic cycle tests at 20 mA g-1 the cells werefirst charged to 3.8 V, followed by a discharge which is displayed inFigure 2a. NMOflakes showed a discharge capacity of 147 mA h g-1 after an initial charge capacity of 41 mA h g-1, and the NCO flakes exhibited a discharge capacity of 153 mA h g -1 after an initial charge capacity of 30 mA h g-1. For NMO spheres, thefirst discharge capacity was 188 mA h g-1 after an initial charge capacity of 106 mA h g-1 and for the NCO spheres thefirst discharge capacity was 183 mA h g-1 after an initial charge capacity of 55 mA h g-1. Potential reasons for the higher capacity of the spheres are stacking faults as mentioned above or an increased amount of defects as a result of the synthetic route. NMOflakes show various minor plateaus duri ng discharge indicating Na + Figure 1. FESEM pictures of pristine NCO (a)flakes, (b) spheres. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2043 ordering processes. 27,29,40–42 For the curve of the NMO spheres, these features are enhanced, whereas neither NCO flakes nor NCO spheres exhibit most of these minor plateaus. The minor plateaus, and the lack thereof for the doped materials, can easily be seen when plotting the derivative of the potential with respect to the capacity (Figure S2). Co-doped spheres, which have not been presented in literature before, show a capacity increase as compared to the NCOflakes, while lacking distinct features in the discharge curve as opposed to NMO spheres. For galvanostatic cycle tests at 50 mA g-1 (Figure 2b), NCO flakes (71% capacity retention over 100 cycles and 65% after 150 cycles) show an improvement in cycling stability over NMOflakes (59%/52%). The same effect of doping is observed for the spherical morphology. While spheres have higher capacity retention than flakes for both doped and undoped material, the Co-doped spheres are more stable than the undoped NMO spheres (75% vs 67% after 100 cycles and 67% vs 58% at 150 cycles). Moreover, Co-doped materials also show better rate capability (Figure 2c). At a current rate of 400 mA g-1 (∼2.2C), the obtained capacity is 120 mA h g-1. Possible reasons for the observed effects are discussed below. Manganese Dissolution. The observed fading prompted us to investigate Mn2+ dissolution from the active materials following a potential disproportionation of Mn3+ into Mn2+ and Mn4+.30,43,44 Calculations on the hypothetical amount of manganese in the electrolyte, assuming that capacity fading is only due to manganese dissolution, show that the respective values (∼10–20 ppm) are significantly above the detection limits for ICP, AAS, and EDS. However, neither ICP, nor AAS, nor EDS measurements of the processed and concentrated electrolyte were able to detect dissolved manganese. The Mn detection limit for these methods is ∼1 ppm, so that the amount of dissolved Mn (if any) is <1 ppm. Consequently, a capacity fading of≥1% should be detectable by these methods if it were resulting from Mn dissolution. Thus, it can be concluded that manganese dissolution has a negligible effect on capacity fading of the P2-type materials presented in this work and cannot explain the differences between the respective materials. Structural Studies.In the following sections, the structural processes as a further cause of the different cycling performances are investigated. NMO Flakes. During discharge (3.8 V -1.5 V), the Na + content (x) increased from 0.46 to 0.98. The (002) reflection shifts to a higher angle, reflecting a contraction of the unit cell along the c-lattice parameter ( Figure 3 a). As Na + inserts between the MnO6 layers, the negative charges of the oxygen between different layers are screened, which moves the layers closer together. The shift of the (010) reflection to lower angles reflects an expansion of the unit cell along the aand bdirections (Figure 3b). The cause of this is a decrease of the oxidation state of manganese during discharge, which results in an expansion of the MnO 6-octahedra and, therefore, an expansion of theaand b-lattice parameters.18,22 Two different phases can be observed during discharge. Initially, the hexagonal P2-type phase of the pristine material is maintained up to a Na+ loading of ∼0.87. Then, new reflections occur in the pattern (at 2θ° = 21.3, 23.6, 26.2, 29.6, 37.8, 38.9, 43.1, 45.0; see Figure 4; minor impurity from hydrated phase45,46) and become more intense until the end of the discharge at 1.5 V. Moreover, an overlap of a reflection from the original pattern with a reflection from the newly emerging phase is detectable (2θ° ≈ 10.2). These new re flections are in line with an orthorhombic phase. Typically, this phase is called the P ′2 phase.13,18,47 In Figure 3a the c-lattice parameter development of the initial P2 and the evolving P′2 phase is displayed (Table S2 shows aand b-lattice parameters of P′2). Figure 5a shows phase.13,18,47 In Figure 3a the c-lattice parameter development of the initial P2 and the evolving P′2 phase is displayed (Table S2 shows aand b-lattice parameters of P′2). Figure 5a shows the diffraction pattern of the NMOflakes at 1.5 V, as well as the simulated pattern for both the initial hexagonal phase and of the newly formed orthorhombic phase (Cmcm space group). The new re flections in the pattern fitw e l lw i t ht h e orthorhombic phase. Other reflections that occur at similar positions for both the new orthorhombic and the initial hexagonal phase show a broadening of the reflections in the diffraction pattern due to an overlap of the reflections from the two phases. This phase transition is attributed to the increased amount of Jahn-Teller active Mn 3+ in its d 4 high-spin configuration. The resulting distortion leads to a transformation of the hexagonal to the orthorhombic unit cell. In the subsequent charge process, the P′2 phase disappears.47 To check whether the phase change is partially irreversible, the NMOflakes|Na-half cell was cycled offline, and the diffraction Figure 2.(a) Discharge profiles of NMOflakes and spheres and NCO flakes and spheres for galvanostatic cycling at 20 mA g-1, (b) cycling stability for cycling at 50 mA g-1, (c) rate test (current rates in mA g-1). Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2044 patterns at OCV were measured after 5, 10, and 15 cycles. However, no remnant of the P′2 phase could be identified. Thus, it is concluded that the phase transformation is reversible. NCO Flakes. The Na+ content changes from 0.49 to 1.0 during discharge. Developments of the lattice parameters are similar to NMOflakes (Figure 3a,b). The c-lattice parameters decrease by 0.11 Å, and thea/b-lattice parameters increase by 0.08 Å. This is also reflected in the unit cell volume, which, for both materials, increases by∼4Å 3 (4.5%) over the course of the full discharge (Figure 3c). However, during discharge, no new phase could be detected even though the amount of inserted Na+ was similar to NMOflakes (Figure 6). In contrast to high-spin Mn3+, which distorts the structure, Co3+ is Jahn- Figure 3. First discharge (after an initial charge process). Development of the (a)c-lattice parameter of NMOflakes, the evolving P′2 phase for NMO flakes, NCO flakes, and NCO spheres; (b) development of the a/b-lattice parameter of NMO and NCOflakes and NCO spheres; (c) development of the unit cell volume of NMO and NCOflakes and NCO spheres. The two-phase region for the NMO flakes is indicated. In this two-phase region lattice parameters are only shown when they could be clearly distinguished. Figure 4.

Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2045 Teller inactive. This suggests that substituting manganese with cobalt on the order of 10% has a stabilizing effect. Moreover, as shown in the Electrochemical Studies, Co suppresses Na + ordering processes in the structure, which otherwise occur for the undoped material. These two effects eliminate structural heterogeneity that inherently occurs as the result of repeated structural transformations. The suppression of these phase transitions is suggested to be the reason for the enhanced cycling stability of the NCOflakes over the NMOflakes. NCO Spheres.In order to examine whether morphology has an influence on these transitions, spherical NCO, for which no phase transition is anticipated due to the suppression of transitions by Co-doping, is discussed here. During discharge from 3.8–1.5 V, Na+ content was increased over a wider range: from 0.43 to 1.05. As can be seen inFigure 7, similar to NCO flakes, no phase change occurs. Thus, the difference in cycling stability between the flakes and spheres cannot be the consequence of phase transitions. While the change of theclattice parameter is similar to that of the NCOflakes, the blattice parameter, and therefore also the unit cell volume, changes less severely (Figure 3). Thus, the stress on the crystal structure is reduced as compared to the flakes and the volume expansion of the spheres (∼2.3%) while discharging from 3.8–1.5 V is only half the volume change of the flakes (∼4.8%). The effect on the structure is exacerbated by the anisotropic expansion of the lattice parameters. As thec-lattice parameter decreases during Na+ insertion, the expansion of the unit cell volume is based on an increase of theaandb-lattice parameter, i.e., an expansion within the plane of MnO6-octahedra. This difference might be one contributing factor to the superior cycling stability of spheres over flakes and could be the cause of the difference in the preservation of morphology over the course of cycling described previously.35 Comparison of Strain Distribution.For undoped materials, the phase change giving rise to additional overlapping reflections makes detailed comparison of the structures difficult. However, given there is no phase transition at high Na+ content for Co-doped materials we can directly compare NCO spheres and NCO flakes. As described above, the volume change is greater for the flakes. Despite the ability to accommodate a slightly larger amount of Na+ in the structure of the NCO spheres (1.05 Na+ for NCO spheres compared to 1.00 Na+ for NCO flakes), the shift in the (002) reflection to higher 2θ° angles for NCO spheres is particularly modest. While one may not be able to infer much from the contraction along thecdirection, observable differences in the FWHM are apparent for the (002) and (004) reflection for the NCO spheres as detailed in Table S3. Here we look at the relative ratio of FWHM(004)/ FWHM(002). For the NCOflakes, while there is no appreciable change in the ratio (within the error) when increasing the Na+ content from 0.6 (OCV) to 1.0, there is a modest observable variation at a low sodium content of 0.49 Na+ (FWHM(004)/ FWHM(002) = 1.18). This possibly indicates a larger distribution of strain in the material. The ratio FWHM(004)/FWHM(002) is larger for NCO spheres. While it is∼1 around OCV (0.5–0.6 Na+), it is >1 when moving away from OCV in either direction, i.e., for Na+ < 0.5 and Na+ > 0.6. This suggests that although there is a lesser volume change for the spheres, a greater degree of strain distribution in the material is present at high and low Na+ loading, implying possible inhomogeneities in the distribution of Na + concentration throughout the material. While the mechanism by which this takes place is unclear, it is postulated that this ability to accommodate strain rather than release it in the form of lattice expansion may have two effects: (i) protect the material from structural fatigue during successive cycling leading to superior cycling stability and (ii) facilitate the (i) protect the material from structural fatigue during successive cycling leading to superior cycling stability and (ii) facilitate the broader range of sodium content. While it is not possible to observe such differences in the FWHM for NMO spheres for the aforementioned reasons, given the similar performance of the materials it is hypothesized that the same strain accommodation ability may also be one of the reasons for superior cycling stability and capacity of NMO spheres as compared toflakes. NMO Spheres. Na+ content increases from 0.35 to 1.02 during discharge. The development of the diffraction patterns of NMO spheres shows three different phases in the course of one discharge (Figure 8). In the charged state, i.e., at Na+ contents between 0.35–0.49, the diffraction pattern shows a two phase region with reflections from a nonhexagonal phase. From a Na+ loading of 0.82, new reflections (2θ° ≈ 20.8, 36.3, 37.8, 42.3) and a broadening of the (010) reflection at 2θ° ≈ 22.5 are observed. Moreover, a significant broadening of the (002) reflection (2θ° ≈ 10.3) at the end of the discharge is visible. The reflections at low sodium content are attributed to a so-called “Z” phase, which represents a structure in which, based on the initial P2-type structure, the layers of MnO6octahedra are shifted.18,47 Even though in some publications an OP4 phase is reported,8,21 Talaie et al. modeled this newly emerging phase with an O2 2× 2 × 10 supercell, in which the position of the respective layers was randomized.18 According Figure 6. Pattern development for NCO flakes (synchrotron radiation: λ = 0.974 Å,* denote aluminum reflections). Figure 7. Pattern development for NCO spheres (synchrotron radiation: λ = 0.974 Å,* denotes aluminum reflections). Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2046 to Mortemard de Boisse et al., this phase with its lack of longrange order for the MO2 constituents is most suitably called“Z” phase.47 This phase, however, disappeared during discharge. From a Na+ content of 0.49, only the initial P2-stacking order is detectable. InFigure S3athe c-lattice of the original P2 and the “Z” phase of the NMO spheres are shown. In the two phase region, i.e., at a low Na+ content, the c-lattice of the P2 phase stays rather constant. With the disappearance of the“Z” phase the c-lattice of the P2 phase increases until the electrostatic interaction between Na+ and the Mn-O layers results in a decrease of the interlayer distance. Over the development of the single P2 phase region, thea/b-lattice parameter does not change significantly, leading to a smaller volume change of the NMO spheres compared to NMOflakes (Figure S3b,c). The occurrence of the P′2 phase is not as clear as for the NMO flakes. The new reflections at 20.8 and 42.3 as well as the broadening around 10.3 2 θ° could indicate the P ′2 phase. However, a new reflection at 2θ° ≈ 36.8 is not in line with an emerging P′2 phase, which suggests that another new phase is formed. Moreover, the prominent reflections between 2θ° = 23–30, which are indicative of a unit cell with theCmcm space group, are absent. This suggests that the contribution from the P′2 phase is small. Occasionally, impurities from differences in the MnO2 stacking can occur during synthesis. Nevertheless, a comparison of the newly emerging reflections with the patterns of the related layered P3, O3, and O′3 phase showed that these phases do not explain the new reflections.33,48 A structure that could explain the unidentified reflection at 36 2θ°, and also the aforementioned reflections at 21 and 42 2θ°, is cubic Na3MnO4 (space group P213). Although this structure is not in line with the layered oxide structure, the precursor for our spherical P2type NMO was amorphous MnO2,w h i c h ,a ts y n t h e s i s temperature, is converted to Mn2O3 which crystallizes in a cubic structure. Thus, a minor part of the Mn2O3 precursor might not have been transformed to P2-type NMO during the annealing process and has taken up Na+ at potentials of 2.2–1.5 Figure 8.

For the undoped materials the two phase regions are indicated. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2047 Vv sN a|Na+, possibly resulting in the detectable presence of this phase. A shoulder at 2θ° = 20.6, where Mn2O3 has its most intense reflection, supports this hypothesis. The mechanism for this transformation and the concomitant change in the Mn:O ratio, however, is still unclear. There may have been unreacted amorphous MnOx that can have crystallized.Figure 5b shows the diffraction pattern of the NMO spheres at OCV and at 1.5 V, as well as simulated patterns of the initial P2 phase, and of the potentially formed P′2 phase and cubic P213 space group. Sharma et al. recently showed that, even for the same material, the formation of the P′2 phase depends on the current rate at which the material is cycled, i.e., on kinetic factors.49 These factors could be influenced by stacking faults or defects in the structure. Di fferent tendencies for NMO flakes and spheres to form the P′2 phase could therefore be attributed to different kinetic behavior, such as nucleation of the new phase. The smaller changes in the unit cell volume of the spheres, in combination with the lower concentration of the P′2 phase throughout cycling, reduce structural stresses and fatigue. These effects are considered to be the leading contributors to the observed higher cycling stability of the materials with spherical morphology. The NCO spheres do not show the impurity attributed to the Mn2O3 precursor. Moreover, the Co-doped materials have a larger average crystallite size than the undoped analogues, as indicated by sharper reflections in the XRD pattern. This is in line with findings by Paulsen et al. that incorporating Co into the structure can facilitate the formation of the P2 phase during synthesis.28 Thus, the Co-doped materials are anticipated to contain a lower degree of amorphous/untransformed material, which can crystallize in the suspected cubic phase. In our measurements, the “Z” phase was not observed for low Na+ contents for the NCO spheres. However, Na+ content during the initial charge might just not have been decreased sufficiently to induce the formation of the“Z” phase. Diffusion and Conductivity Properties. Filling up a given structure with Na+ influences the mobility of these Naions and, thus, affects diffusion properties. As structural changes result in different pathways along which Na+ can move in the structure, phase transitions also have an effect on diffusion. To elucidate these changes, GITT and in situ EIS were performed. Figure 9 shows the development of the e ffective diffusion coefficients for all materials during the course of one discharge as measured by GITT. Minima of the diffusion coefficient are indicative of the exhaustion of certain processes or structural rearrangements.50 Between a Na+ content of 0.45 and 0.67, i.e., the solid solution region, diffusion coefficients are comparable, and develop in parallel, for all materials. The di ffusion coefficient is between 10–9-10–10 cm² s-1, which is considered to indicate fast diffusion processes for an insertion material. Minor changes (i.e., minima) can be observed in this region for undoped NMOflakes (Figure 9a) and spheres (Figure 9c), which correlate well with small plateaus in the discharge curve that signify Na+ ordering processes (Figure 2a). At a Na + content of ∼0.67, diffusion coefficients for all materials start decreasing. For Na+ contents beyond that, the values diverge. NMO flakes show a local minimum at a Na+ content of ∼0.77 (DNa+ ≈ 10–12 cm² s-1), followed by an increase and, subsequently, another minimum ( DNa+ ≈ 10–13 cm² s-1). Both the electrochemistry and GITT measurements suggest the start of afirst structural transition at a Na+ content of∼0.7. The diffraction data, however, did not show any phase change in this region (Figure 4). This minimum can be explained by a high concentration overpotential, which results in a rearrangement of the Na-ions between the MnO6-layers and thus in changes of the diffusion properties. The second minimum atx = 0.97 is concentration overpotential, which results in a rearrangement of the Na-ions between the MnO6-layers and thus in changes of the diffusion properties. The second minimum atx = 0.97 is attributed to the phase transition toward the orthorhombic phase as observed by synchrotron XRD (Figures 4 and 5a). GITT measurements suggest the phase transition takes place at a slightly higher Na+ content than indicated by XRD. This difference can possibly be attributed to the nature of the GITT analysis. For the calculation of the Na+ content, only the Na+ insertion induced by the applied current is considered, while minor deviations from the typical galvanostatic behavior have been observed for this method before.47,50,51 Slower relaxation times during the major plateau at∼2.2–2.1 V as compared to the solid solution region (e.g., ∼2.9 V) are attributed to a decrease of electric and/or ionic conductivity ( Figure S4). Except for this second minimum at high Na+ contents, NCO flakes (Figure 9b) show the same trend as NMOflakes, i.e., the same position for the main minima and maxima, albeit at considerable higher values for the diffusion coefficient (DNa+ ≈ 10–12 cm² s-1 for the minimum). This increase is attributed to the effect of the Co. For NMO spheres (Figure 9c) the trend is similar to the NMOflakes. However, the structural transition at ∼0.7 starts at a minimum value of DNa+ ≈ 10–10 cm² s-1, followed by a decrease to lower values for the di ffusion coefficient (DNa+ ≈ 10–12 cm² s-1)a taN a+ content ofx ≈ 0.88. Moreover, a third minimum occurs at a Na+ content of ∼1.02. The diffusion coefficient of the last minimum is comparable to the minimum of the NMOflakes which was attributed to the phase transition toward the P′2 phase. This substantiates the hypothesis of a phase transition from the hexagonalP63/mmc to the orthorhombicCmcm phase discussed in the section on Structural Studies. The minimum which indicates the phase transition toward an orthorhombic phase for both NMO materials can be seen neither for the Co-dopedflakes nor spheres. This is in line with suppression of the phase transition as concluded in theStructural Studies section. Over the whole P2 phase region both NCOflakes and spheres exhibit higher diffusion coefficients than the undoped analogues. This is explained by enhancement of the Na+ conductivity as a result of Co-doping. This higher conductivity is also reflected in the rate capability, which is better for the Co-doped materials (Figure 2c). The reason for the lower conductivity of the undoped material is attributed to the high resistivity induced by the Mn3+, which, in its d4 high-spin configuration, is a Jahn-Teller active ion and has more localized electrons to interact with the positively charged sodium.52,53 For LiMnO2, doping results in a suppression of the Jahn -Teller e ffect, which lowers the diffusion barrier and thus increases ionic conductivity. 54 A similar effect is assumed here. Moreover, the suppression of the Na+ ordering may further facilitate the Na+ transport between the layers. These findings have been confirmed by EIS (Table S5 and Figure S5) in a three-electrode setup for NMO and NCOflakes at various potentials. Even though the trend for the chargetransfer resistance is similar in the beginning, i.e., in thefirst charge and thefirst part of the subsequent discharge, the values for NMO flakes and NCO flakes diverge at approximately 2.5 V, shortly before the onset of the pronounced plateau. In the plateau, while there are no phase transitions osidbserved in the XRD, the increase of charge transfer resistance of NMO is one order of magnitude larger than the respective value for NCOflakes. This provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that the stabilizing effect of Co is not limited to Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 2041–2051 2048 structural stabilization but can also improve cycling stability through enhanced ionic conductivity in the electrode. ■ CONCLUSION P2-type NaxMnO2 and NaxCo0.1Mn0.9O2 were synthesized in two di fferent morphologies, hexagonal flakes and hollow spheres. Their structural and diffusion properties in the context of sodium-ion battery cathodes were investigated using in operando synchrotron XRD, GITT, and in situEIS. In addition, dissolved manganese could not be detected in the electrolyte for NMO flakes over the course of cycling and is therefore thought to play a negligible role. P2-NaxMnO2 flakes undergo partial phase transition toward an orthorhombic crystal system upon the insertion of Na+, while Co-doping on the order of 10% suppresses these structural transformations. The lack of repeated phase transitions might reduce inhomogeneity in the structure and, together with the suppression of Na+ ordering processes, explain the better cycling stability of the doped material. In addition to the beneficial structural effects, Codoping is also shown to have a positive influence on Na-ion transport within the structure. This not only explains the better rate capability of doped vs undoped materials but could also contribute toward improved cycling stability. Superior cycling stability of hollow spheres as compared toflakes is attributed to the reduced volume expansion and contraction for the spheres. Thus, increased strain within the structure of the spheres is one explanation for this difference. Moreover, the spherical material shows a higher capacity, which is attributed to structural defects. The e ffects of Co-doping are di fferent from the intended e ffect for other transition metals. Incorporating elements such as Ni or Fe into the structure aims at increasing energy density by exploiting the high potential of their respective redox reactions. In addition, Yabuuchi et al. showed that incorporating 50% of Fe into the structure increases cycling stability by suppressing Na + ordering processes; 8 however, Fe does not prevent phase transformation in the lower voltage region.18,22,47 Ni-substitution, on the other hand, does not eliminate Na + ordering processes but enhances structural stability by alleviating the Jahn-Teller distortion and delaying the phase transitions between 2.1–1.5 V.21,24,27,46 Incorporating a relatively small amount of Co as low as 10%into the structure enhances Na+ conductivity, suppresses Na+ ordering, and prevents phase transformation between 2.1–1.5 V and thus allows a more reversible exploitation of the capacity that can be obtained in this voltage region. A combined approach of the two presented material optimization routes, i.e., doping and morphology optimization, has been shown to be most successful in attaining superior capacity and cycling stability for the investigated materials. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT *S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: Information on XRD data of the pristine materials, the derivative of the potential with respect to capacity for NMO and NCO spheres, theaandb-lattice parameters of the evolving orthorhombic phase, changes of the FWHM for NCOflakes and spheres, development of the lattice parameters for NMO spheres, relaxation behavior of NMO flakes as obtained by GITT, and EIS data for NMO and NCOflakes including fit( PDF) ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author *(M.S.)

By electrochemically extracting Li from a monoclinic layered Li2MnO3, we prepared Li2-xMnO3 (x = 1.6–1.8) of which the Li-extracted domain has a cubic spinel structure. The reversible discharge and charge capacity of Li2-xMnO3 versus the Na negative electrode initially exceeded 200 mA· h · g-1, suggesting that close to one molar equivalent of Na is inserted in and extracted from the formula unit, Li 2-xMnO3. The electrode retains the capacity of 160 mA · h · g-1 after 50 cycles. On the other hand, the Li2-xMnO3 electrode versus the Li negative electrode significantly degrades upon cycling. The ex-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the spinel domain of Li 2-xMnO3 retains its crystallographic structure during the Na insertion and extraction, although the crystal significantly loses its periodicity when Na is inserted. A numerical simulation of the SR-XRD profile suggests that the Na-inserted Li2-xMnO3 has the periodicity of only one to two unit cells while retaining the spinel structure. XAS revealed that the reversible capacity is found to be dominated by the redox between Mn(III) and Mn(IV) and the Mn-Mn distance significantly loses its correlation upon Na-insertion, which is consistent with the broad SR-XRD profile. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Sodium containing Mn-based oxides have become the focus of attraction as a positive electrode material for the sodium ion battery since manganese is an abundant resource and can be considered a low-cost material[1–4]. For example, ̨-NaMnO2 with the monoclinic structure and P2-type Na0.6MnO2 with the hexagonal layered structure, have high initial reversible capacities of more than 180 and 150 mA· h · g-1, respectively[5,6]. With the reversible capacity of only 90 mA· h · g-1 notwithstanding, Na0.44MnO2 with a tunneltype structure undergoes many cycles [7]. When Li is inserted in and extracted from lithium manganese oxides (e.g., LiMn2O4, LiMnO2, etc.), the Mn3+ ⇌Mn4+ redox is often accompanied by a crystallographic phase transition, resulting in a poor cycle stability[8]. A monoclinic layered oxide, Li 2MnO3,i s not an exception; namely, although the initial discharge capacity exceeds 250 mA· h · g-1, the material suffers from a significant degradation upon cycling caused by the transition into a cubic ∗ Corresponding author.

On the other hand, the energetic barrier for such a transition is said to be much higher in the case of Na insertion and extraction[10]. If we can reversibly sodiate and desodiate Li2-xMnO3 suppressing its crystallographic transition, we would be able to achieve a high capacity and long cycle-life electrode material for the sodium ion battery. The reaction mechanism and stoichiometry of Li 2MnO3 to explain its high reversible capacity is not yet clear and still a controfor the sodium ion battery. The reaction mechanism and stoichiometry of Li 2MnO3 to explain its high reversible capacity is not yet clear and still a controversy. For the discussion below, we now mention some presumable reactions, where A typically stands for Li or an alkaline metal, in general. The initial oxidation reaction is allegedly accompanied by oxygen release[11–13], which could be written as, in a complete hypothetical stoichiometry, A2MnIVO3 -→A+ + e- + MnIVO2 + 1 2 O2. (1) During the subsequent A-reinsertion, the released oxygen is considered to be hardly resumed. The following redox of Mn would be dominant: MnIVO2 + A+ + e- ←-AMnIIIO2.

Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 459 In the present study, we prepared Li 2-xMnO3 by electrochemically extracting Li from Li 2MnO3. The electrochemical properties of Li2-xMnO3 were evaluated in a half-cell setup in which Na metal was used as the counter electrode. The crystallographic structure was investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an electron energy-loss spectrometer (EELS). The chemical state and local structure were examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Broad humps in the SR-XRD profile of the sodiated Li2-xMnO3 were numerically simulated to confirm its spinel structure. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Sample preparation A layered manganese oxide, Li2MnO3, as the starting material in this study was prepared by the solid-state reaction between Li2CO3 (Kishida Chemical, purity 98%) and Mn2O3 (Aldrich, purity 99.9%). Li2CO3 and Mn2O3 were mixed by ball-milling in air at the molar ratio of 2:1 for the target composition to be Li:Mn = 2:1. The mixture was calcined in a gold crucible in air for 10 h at 800◦C at which we obtained the best qualified Li 2MnO3 sample in the examined temperature range from 400 to 1000◦C. The Li-extracted sample, Li 2-xMnO3, was prepared by electrochemically extracting lithium from the Li 2MnO3 as follows (see the next subsection for the electrochemical cell assembly). A Li2MnO3/Li cell was first galvanostatically charged ( i.e.,L i extracted or delithiated) to 4.95 Vvs.L i+/Li at the current density of 10 mA· g-1, then potentiostatically charged until the total amount of the charge reached 460 mA · h · g-1. The Li 2-xMnO3 electrode, removed from the cell, was rinsed several times with dimethyl carbonate and then reassembled into a Li2-xMnO3/Na cell. The cell was galvanostatically discharged (i.e., Na inserted or sodiated) to 1.5 V vs.N a+/Na at the current density of 10 mA· g-1. 2.2. Electrochemical properties The electrode was prepared by attaching a mixture of the active material (84 wt.%), acetylene black (AB; 8 wt.%) as the conductive additive and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; 8 wt.%) as the binder to an aluminum mesh. The total mass of the active material per electrode was about 7–8 mg. Throughout the present study, the electrochemical capacity was expressed in terms of per initial mass of Li2MnO3. The electrode was tested in an IEC R2032 coin-type cell assembled with a sodium or lithium foil counter electrode, a separator (Celgard 2400) and the electrolyte (1 mol· L-1 of LiPF6 or NaPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate, EC/DEC (1:1 volume ratio). On initial sodiation process, the cell was galvanostatically discharged (i.e., Na inserted or sodiated) at the current density of 10 mA· g-1, until the potential reached 1.5 V vs.N a+/Na, at which it was then potentiostatically discharged until the current density dropped to 1 mA· g-1. Following process, the cell was galvanostatically charged and discharged at the current density of 10mA· g-1. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were evaluated using a battery testing system (BLS series, Keisokuki Center). 2.3. Material characterization The crystallographic structures of the samples were characterized by a laboratory X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku RINT CuK ̨) and by synchrotron radiation XRD (SR-XRD, SPring-8, BL19B2). For the SR-XRD, the samples were placed in a glass capillary with a 0.5 mm outer diameter. The data were collected using a DebyeScherrer camera with an imaging plate. The wavelength of the X-ray was calibrated to/NAK/nm = 0.06995 using CeO2 as the standard material. The diffraction angle, 2/DC2, ranged from 5.00 to 78.00◦, for which one scan took 300 s. The precise crystallographic structures of the samples were determined by the Rietveld refinements of the SR-XRD data using the RIETAN-FP program[14]. The molar ratio of Na to Mn (Na/Mn) was evaluated by an of the samples were determined by the Rietveld refinements of the SR-XRD data using the RIETAN-FP program[14]. The molar ratio of Na to Mn (Na/Mn) was evaluated by an inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. The local structure and valence shift of the Mn ion were evaluated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, Rits, BL3). The morphology of the sample powders was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6390 JEOL) and the distribution of the constituent elements was detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The nano structure of the sample powders was observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, 3000F, JEOL) equipped with an electron energy-loss spectrometer (EELS), by which the chemical state of the elements was measured. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Precursor Li2MnO3 The XRD profile of the precursor,Fig. 1, is quite consistent with that simulated for the monoclinic Li 2MnO3 phase (PDF #01–0841634, space group C2/m). The profile is free of impurity signals, evidence for a successful synthesis. One finds from the SEM image inset inFig. 1 that the Li2MnO3 sample is comprised of a mixture of spherical and hexagonal particles of ∼300 nm diameter. 3.2. Sodiation of Li2-xMnO3 Fig. 2 shows the electrochemical potential profiles during the initial charge ( i.e., delithiation) process of the Li 2MnO3/Li cell and during the subsequent discharge ( i.e., sodiation) of the Li2-xMnO3/Na cell. This result is compared to that during the discharge process of the Li 2-xMnO3/Li cell ( i.e., lithiation). The lower abscissa indicates the electrochemical capacity in terms of mA· h · g-1 and the upper one is converted to the molar equivalent (mol eq) of Li or Na in the Li2-xMnO3 by assuming that the observed capacity would purely result from the alkali metal extraction and insertion; namely, 460 mA· h · g-1 corresponds to 2.0 mol eq. The left hand-side ordinate indicates the potential difference referenced to Li metal and the right hand-side one to Na metal, in which the numerals of the latter are shifted +0.3 from the former in order to reflect the difference in the standard redox potentials of these metals;i.e., -3.0 and -2.7 V vs. NHE for Li and Na, respectively. During the initial delithiation, a potential plateau is observed at around 4.5 Vvs.L i +/Li which corresponds to the oxygen release [12]. When the charge capacity of Li2MnO3 reaches 460 mA· h · g-1, Fig. 1. XRD profile and a SEM image of the as-prepared Li2MnO3 precursor. (X-ray: Cu K ̨) 460 R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 Fig. 2. Electrochemical potential profiles of the Li 2MnO3 electrode during the initial delithiation (solid line) and the subsequent sodiation (dashed line) or lithiation (solid line). the electrode potential rises to 4.9 V vs.L i+/Li. During the subsequent sodiation, Li 2-xMnO3 is capable of inserting 0.99 mol eq of Na ions (or 238 mA· h · g-1). The fact that the capacity of the lithiation exceeds that of the sodiation and the potential of the former is higher than that of the latter even if taking into account the 0.3 V difference in the redox potentials of Li and Na implies that Li+ is more easily inserted into Li 2-xMnO3 than Na +, probably due to the smaller ionic radius of the former (0.076 nm) than the latter (0.102 nm). The ICP measurement suggests that 0.96 mol eq of Na is contained in the sodiated Li 2-xMnO3, which is consistent with the electrochemical capacity observed during the sodiation. However, the ICP measurement also detected 0.2–0.4 mol eq of Li residing in the Li2-xMnO3 both before and after the sodiation (i.e., x= 1.6–1.8), which is at odds with the initial delithiation capacity. We suspect that certain side reactions, such as the decomposition of the electrolyte at a higher potential, may be involved in the initial delithiation process. The residual Li-containing phase is also detected by TEM and SR-XRD as shown below. As for the structure of the sodiated Li2-xMnO3, see the “TEM and EELS observation” and its subsequent sections. 3.3. Electrode performance Fig. 3 compares the charge and discharge profiles of the cells, Li2-xMnO3/Li (LMO) and Li2-xMnO3/Na (NMO). Initially, the reversible capacity of the LMO exceeds that of the NMO. However, after more than 30 cycles, the capacity of the NMO surpasses that of the LMO. The slope of the charge and discharge profiles of the LMO becomes steeper than that of the NMO upon cycling, especially above 3.5 Vvs.L i+/Li or 3.2 Vvs.N a+/Na, implying more serious damage in the LMO than in the NMO. The cycle trends in the discharge capacity of the LMO and NMO are compared in Fig. 4. The potential range of the cycle test was set to 2.5–4.5 V vs.L i+/Li for the LMO and 1.5–4.2 V vs.N a+/Na for the NMO, so that the first discharge capacities of both the LMO and NMO are around 250 mA· h · g-1. Although the LMO enjoys a higher capacity than the NMO during the initial ten cycles, its capacity significantly decays to less than 100 mA· h · g-1 in the following ten cycles. On the other hand, the NMO retains about 85% of the second discharge capacity observed during the second cycle after 50cycles,i.e.„ 160 mA· h · g-1. Fig. 3. Charge and discharge profiles of the Li2-x MnO3-electrodes versus (a) Li (LMO) and (b) Na (NMO). The coulombic efficiency of the NMO maintains more than 9899% after a few initial cycles, while that of the LMO drops to less than 90%. This suggests that the large structural distortion due to the Mn migration during the cycling is severer for Li insertion and extraction than for Na. 3.4. TEM and EELS analyses Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of (a) as-prepared Li 2MnO3, (b) Li2-xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2-xMnO3. The high crystallinity of the Fig. 4. Cycle trends in the discharge capacity of the Li2-x MnO3-electrodes using Li (LMO) and Na (NMO) as the counter electrode. R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 461 Fig. 5. TEM observation of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) Li2-x MnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2-x MnO3. Top: real-space images, Middle: diffraction patterns from a domain in which residual Li was observed after delithiation and Bottom: diffraction patterns from a domain which was completely delithiated. as-prepared Li2MnO3 is reflected in its fine diffraction spots, which are well assigned to the space groupC2/m, consistent withFig. 1.I n the particles after the delithiation, Li2-xMnO3, Fig. 5(b), we found two domains distinguishable by their diffraction patterns, one of which is attributable to the zone axis [112] of the spinel structure (space groupFd ̄3m), Fig. 5(b-1), and the other to [001] of C2/m, Fig. 5(b-2). The spinel domain should be the unreacted Li 2MnO3 since the inter-planar spacing calculated from the diffraction spots coincides with that from the electron diffraction simulated from the structural model of Li2MnO3 [15]. The Fd ̄3m domain is considered to be the reacted ( i.e., delithiated) phase which has a spinel structure, i.e., /NAK-MnO2. The presence of the Li residue is consistent with the ICP measurement mentioned in the section “Sodiation of Li2-xMnO3”. The arrangement of the oxygen atoms in the [112] plane ofFd ̄3m resembles that in the [001] plane of C2/m, suggesting that the interface between these two phases is coherent [16]. After the sodiation, Fig. 5(c), while the unreacted C2/m phase retains its space group and lattice constant intact, the diffraction spots from theFd ̄3m domain significantly change. The following detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that this sodiated domain is not a layered structure, but remains to be a spinel structure, although it may be tetragonally distorted. The six diffraction spots marked with circles inFig. 5(c-2) nearly form a regular hexagon, giving the inter-planar distance ( d-spacing) of 0.149–0.152 nm. Were the sodiated domain the layered structure of C2/m space group, i.e., layered ̨-NaMnO2, Fig. 5(c-2) should be along the zone axis [001] and the six spots should correspond to the Miller indices of± 2 ±2 0 and ±4 0 0, respectively. However, the experimentally observed d-spacing of layered ̨-NaMnO2 of these planes is 0.13 nm [22], which is inconsistent with the present result. In other words, in order for the corresponding d-spacing of the layered structure to be 0.149–0.152 nm, the Mn-O distance should be 0.22–0.26 nm, which is unlikely long by considering their Shannon radii. Another possibility is that the sodiated domain remains to be a spinel. If the six spots precisely form a regular hexagon, the phase is a cubic spinel (e.g., Fd ̄3m), while if it is irregular, the phase is considered tetragonally distorted (e.g., I41/amd). The blur spots, however, do not allow us to decisively state that the 3% difference between 0.149 and 0.152 nm is significant. We proceed the analysis by adopting the lower-symmetry space group ofI41/amd, which is consistent with the Jahn-Teller distortion of Mn(III). In this interpretation, Fig. 5(c-2) is considered along the zone axis [201] of I41/amd and the Miller indices of the six spots correspond to 040, 0 ̄40, 22 ̄4, ̄2 ̄24, 2 ̄2 ̄4 and ̄224 respectively, yielding the lattice constantsa/nm=0.595 and c/nm = 0.8671. Incidentally, the 3% of distortion of the present material, if any, is smaller than that of Li 2MnIII 2 O4 (7%), for which we suspect the reason is that the defects in the Mn site observed by EELS below absorb the Jahn-Teller distortion. By the sodiation, the lattice of the spinel phase expands by 18% in the volume which is much larger than that of other Na inserting materials with layered structures[17]. Therefore, we consider that the spinel to layer transition of /NAK-MnO2 has not occurred during sodiation in this study. Fig. 6 shows the electron energy loss spectra (EELS) of (a) the delithiated (reacted) domain in Li 2-xMnO3 and (b) the sodiated sition of /NAK-MnO2 has not occurred during sodiation in this study. Fig. 6 shows the electron energy loss spectra (EELS) of (a) the delithiated (reacted) domain in Li 2-xMnO3 and (b) the sodiated domain after the sodiation of Li2-xMnO3. The spectra from the unreacted Li-residing domains (not shown) were used as a reference of Li2MnO3. The binding energy of the NaL-edge, ca. 38 eV, is reflected in the increase in the shoulder over the background after the sodiation. A small peak at aroundca. 38 eV inFig. 6(b), which corresponds 462 R. Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 Fig. 6. EELS spectra of (a) delithiated domain in Li2-x MnO3 and (b) sodiated domain after sodiation of Li2-x MnO3. to the binding energy of the Li L-edge, may imply the presence of Li in the sodiated domain as well. However, EELS detects the signal from several tens nanometers region, so that the profile may contain the signal from the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain. While no shift was observed in the oxygen K-edge, the manganese L-edge shifted to a lower binding energy after the sodiation, reflecting the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ as in reaction (2). The molar ratios of oxygen to manganese (O/Mn) was semiquantitatively evaluated by comparing the peak areas of the O K-edge and MnL-edge for each of which the integration ranges were from 550 to 555 eV and from 635 to 670 eV, respectively. To cancel out the intensity drift, the two signals (OK and MnL) were simultaneously recorded. Normalizing the peak area ratio observed in the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain to 3.0, we found O/Mn to be 2.4–2.5 in the delithiated domain of Li 2-xMnO3; i.e., the initial delithiation is accompanied by 0.5–0.6 mol eq of the release oxygen (cf. the reaction (1)) [16]. The O/Mn ratio after sodiation is 2.5–2.7 in the reacted domain, which barely shifted from that before the sodiation. The oxygen uptake reported by Tabuchiet al. [21] during the lithiation of Li1+x(Fe0.25Mn0.75)O2 was not observed1. The fact that O/Mn ratio exceeds 2.0 suggests the Mn sites in the reacting domain abound in defects. These Mn defects might have prohibited the spinel phase from returning to the layered structure in contrast to what is observed by Yabuuchiet al. [23] in which a partial transition from spinel to layer is reported in a Na cell using LiMn2O4. 3.5. Synchrotron XRD The crystallographic change before and after the sodiation was investigated usingex-situ SR-XRD. Fig. 7shows the SR-XRD patterns of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) delithiated Li2-xMnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2-xMnO3. The initial sharp peaks of the as-prepared Li2MnO3 belong to the C2/m transitions to the Fd ̄3m spinel structure, so called /NAK-MnO2, with a slight broadening of the peaks after the delithiation. The peak broadening would ascribed to the structural distortion of/NAK-MnO2 since the O/Mn ratio of Li 2-xMnO3 is estimated to be more than 2.0 indicating that there has some defects in the Mn site of/NAK-MnO2 structure. One also notices that a small amount of unreacted Li2MnO3 remains after the delithiation. These results agree with our TEM observation. Yanet al.observe a gradual structural change from C2/m to Fd ̄3m during the lithium 1 Strictly speaking, this result stipulates that the chemical formula of Li2-x MnO3 be written as “Li2-x MnOy where y = 2.4∼ 2.6”, etc., which we avoid for simplicity. Fig. 7. SR-XRD patterns of (a) as-prepared Li2MnO3, (b) delithiated Li2-x MnO3 and (c) sodiated Li2-x MnO3.( /NAK/nm = 0.06995) extraction and insertion cycling of LiMnO 2 [16], which is in contrast to our result of one-step transition to Fd ̄3m through the Li extraction. We speculate that the greater amount of Li extraction during the first charge process in our study than Yan’s (i.e., 460 vs. about 100 mA· h · g-1) invokes the more drastical phase change in the former than in the latter. No peak shift was observed between the as-prepared Li2MnO3 and the unreacted Li2MnO3 domain of Li2-xMnO3, suggesting that the delithiation is biphasic as Yuet al.reported [11]. The mass fraction of the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase in Li2-xMnO3 is evaluated to be about 30 wt.% by the Rietveld refinement of the SR-XRD profile. Assuming the spinel phase to be MnO2, one finds from this mass fraction that the molar ratio of Li to Mn in the entire delithiated sample to be 0.38, which is in good agreement with the ICP measurement (Li / Mn = 0.45). After the sodiation of Li 2-xMnO3, very broad humps show up, with the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase remaining. The TEM diffraction measurement (Li / Mn = 0.45). After the sodiation of Li 2-xMnO3, very broad humps show up, with the unreacted Li2MnO3 phase remaining. The TEM diffraction spots from the reacted domain ( Fig. 5(c)) suggest that the humps stem from the completely sodiated phase, NaMnO 2, having the spinel structure, yet its crystalline periodicity is considerably lost. In general, the crystallite size is estimated from the peak widths of the XRD based on the Scherrer equation. However, the humps in Fig. 7(c) are so broad that the equation does not exactly apply. We then directly calculated in the real spaces from the diffraction profile ofone crystallite particlewithout any periodic condition as follows. The intensity,I, of the X-ray (wavelength =/NAK) diffracted at the angle /DC2from the atoms situated at ⃗ri and ⃗rj is: |I(/DC2)|2 ∝ ∑ i ∑ j>i fj(/DC2) exp { 2/EMi⃗K · ( ⃗rj - ⃗ri )} (3) where fj is the atomic scattering factor of the atom j, and ⃗K is the scattering vector of which the magnitude is: |⃗K|= 2 sin/DC2 /NAK. (4) Fig. 9 shows the simulated pattern in which superimposed are two profiles of the spinel NaMnO 2 with 0.4 and 1.6 nm sizes, or several unit cells. The structure model is given inFig. 8 and Table 1 with the lattice constant a/nm=0.595 and c/nm = 0.8671 based on the TEM diffraction described above. Note that we don’t consider the presence of the Li ion in the structure. The coordinates of the oxygen atom are fixed based on the EXAFS result (see the next section). The simulated profile well reproduces the experimental result. The delithiated domain of Li2-xMnO3 retains its spinel structure after sodiation, but loses its crystallinity R.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Figs. 10(b) and (c) show the XANES and EXAFS spectra of the Mn K-edge, respectively, taken at the states indicated by the numbers 1–4 in the potential profile, Fig. 10(a). Each state corresponds to (1) as-prepared Li 2MnO3, (2) delithiated Li 2-xMnO3, (3) sodiated Li2-xMnO3, i.e., NMO and (4) desodiated NMO. The inset in (b) magnifies the pre-edge region, 6530–6546 eV, which reflects the 1s→3d transition. The pre-edge signal of the reduced sample, (3), is observed at (B) 6537 eV, which is lower than the other oxidized samples,i.e., (1), (2) and (3) at (A) 6539 eV. In the case of lithium manganese oxide in general, the shift to the lower binding energy of the Mn pre-edge indicates the reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(III), which Fig. 10.

Kataoka et al. / Electrochimica Acta 212 (2016) 458–464 distorts the initially centro-symmetric MnO 6 octahedron due to the Jahn-Teller effect[18,19]. In the present material, the sodiation triggers a similar distortion in the structure, resulting in the broad humps in the SR-XRD profile. Fig 10 (c) shows the radial correlation,/US, as a function of the distance from Mn, R, derived from the EXAFS spectra taken at points (2), (3) and (4) in Fig 10(a). The first peak in /US centering at R/nm = 0.15 is attributed to the Mn-O distance. The peak shape does not apparently change after sodiation. The distortion in the MnO6 octahedron after the sodiation inferred from the XANES spectrum may be too subtle to be reflected in the peak shape of/US2. The second peak in /US at R/nm = 0.2–0.3 corresponds to the Mn-Mn distance. The intensity of this peak significantly decreases during the sodiation, suggesting a significant loss in the crystallographic regularity. This observation is also consistent with the analysis described in the section “SR-XRD”. The Mn-Mn peak intensity increases when the sodiated sample is desodiated again, implying that the regularity is reinstated to some extent. 3.7. Structural change and cycle-life stability When Li2-xMnO3 is cycled in the Li-system, its structure shuttles between the spineland layer-type. During this transition, Mn is prone to migrate from the initial octahedral site to the tetrahedral site, which clogs the Li diffusion in the electrode, resulting in the poor cycle-stability[9]. On the other hand, the present study proved that Li 2-xMnO3 retains the spinel structure in the Na-system, although its crystallographic regularity is significantly lost when sodiated. In case of AMnO2, the layer structure is retained during the redox reaction when A = Na, resulting in a good cycle stability[5], whereas a quick degradation is observed when A = Li[20]. Whether the spinelor layer-structure, the poor stability results from the Mn-migration triggered by the structural phase transition. A computational study by Reedet al.indeed suggests that the Mn-migration to the tetrahedral sites is energetically unfavorable compared to the Li counterpart due to the difference in the ionic sizes[10]. The better cycle stability of Li2-xMnO3 in Na than in Li is presumably achieved by preventing the Mn-migration. 4. Conclusion A spinel manganese oxide, Li2-xMnO3, was synthesized by electrochemically extracting Li from Li 2MnO3, intending to use it as a positive electrode material for the Na-ion battery. The initial discharge capacity of Li2-xMnO3 exceeded 230 mA· h · g-1, corresponding to more than 1.0 mol eq of Na insertion. The discharge capacity remained more than 80% of that observed for the second cycle after 50 cycles. This cycle-stability is superior to the case when Li2-xMnO3 was used in the Li-system. The TEM observation and SRXRD analysis revealed that the material retained its initial spinel structure during the sodiation and desodiation, although the crystallographic regularity was significantly lost during the sodiation. Whether the structural phase transition takes place or not during the redox reaction can be a key for the long cycle-life.

In this work, we propose an effective strategy by a combination of liquid N 2 quenching and aliovalent doping to get new layered cathode materials. As evidenced by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction and solid-state 23 Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the proposed synthesis methods allow tuning the transition metal ions vacancies and enhance Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center of P2-type Mnbased materials. Our results demonstrate that such an optimized structure significantly enhances the deliverable capacity, Na þ mobility and electronic conductivity of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of aliovalent doping elements and different cooling approaches on the long-range structure, local environment and electrochemical performance are comprehensively studied by comparing a wide range of doped Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li, Mg, Al, Fe) materials. The optimized Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 material exhibits a remarkably high initial capacity of 202 mAh g   1 among ever reported P2-type layered oxides within 2–4 V, a stable capacity retention of 81% after 600 cycles and outstanding rate capability of the specific capacity up to 122 mAh g   1 at 1200 mA g   1. 1. Introduction The rapid development of intelligent and environmental-friendly industrial technology, including smart mobile phone and green elec tric vehicles, has made rechargeable batteries an indispensable part of our modern society [ 1, 2 ]. Among various energy storage systems, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with superior high energy and power den sities performance have accounted for the key position [ 3 ]. Neverthe less, the low reserve and uneven distribution of Li resources, and the use of high-cost and toxicity of Co and Ni as redox center for mostly LIBs cathode materials fail to fulfill demands of sustainable development [ 4 ]. Recently, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted many interests and are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact that sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural abundance than lithium [ 5, 6 ]. are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact that sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural abundance than lithium [ 5, 6 ]. In the development of NIBs, cathode is the most critical component that restricts cost and energy density in the full batteries [ 7, 8 ]. Comparing to polyanionic and tunnel-type cathodes materials for NIBs, layered transition metal oxides (Na x MO 2, M 1⁄4 transition metal) are extensively studied because of their high theoretical specific capacity * Corresponding author.

Among them, the low-cost Mn-based layered materials are deemed as ideal cathodes for large-scale energy storage. Two types of stacking structures, O3(ABCABC stacking) and P2(AABB stacking) are frequently observed in most of as-synthesized Na x MnO 2 materials within layered structure materials [ 10 ]. In comparison to the (de)sodiation of O3-type materials via the interstitial tetrahedral sites with relatively higher hopping energy from one octahedral site to another, the P2-type phase allows a direct migration between adjacent prismatic sites, thus enabling rapid Na þ transport and showing better applicability [ 11 ]. However, the available capacities of P2-type cathode materials are still insufficient yet [ 12, 13 ]. To address this issue, anionic redox reaction is introduced as its Li counterpart, which can be triggered to get extra capacity by charging the cells to a higher voltage range of 4.0–4.5 V vs. Na þ /Na (4.3–4.8 V vs. Li þ /Li). Unfortunately, the cathode materials inevitably suffer from electrolyte decomposition, multiple phase transition and even oxygen loss at such a high voltage, resulting in obvious voltage hysteresis and rapid capacity fade [ 14–17 ]. In contrast, controlling the cut-off voltage lower than 4 V for P2-type cathode can effectively eliminate aforementioned shortages and yield a much better cyclability, but the reversible capacity is hardly higher than 175 mAh g   1 [ 18–22 ]. Recent investigations have focused on the optimization of the crys talline/local structures and morphology engineering of Na x MnO 2 by adjusting the Na/Mn ratio, sintering temperature, cooling rate and aliovalent doping [ 20–25 ], which further determine the electrochemical performance. However, the overall performance of the materials is far below our expectation. The understanding of underlying structure-property relationship of the materials, especially the local environment including Mn vacancies, is insufficient for obtaining the material with high capacity and long cycle performance. The formation of Mn vacancies in the transition metal (TM) layers have been observed over 40 years [ 26–29 ]. Parant et al. proposed that Na 0.67 MnO 2 is able to uptake oxygen during the cooling process [ 27 ], resulting in the lift of Mn ions oxidation state and the formation of manganese deficient phases (denoted as □ ): Na 0.67 MnO 2 þ y/2 O 2 → Na 0.67 MnO 2 þ y (Na 0.67/(1 þ y/2) Mn 1/(1 þ y/2) □ (y/2)/(1 þ y/ 2) O 2 ) The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of Dahn ’ s group showed a reversible mass gain and decline which are related to the oxygen uptake and release during cooling and heating, respectively [ 29 ]. The above works demonstrated that Mn vacancies are inclined to form during cooling process and then adjust the valence of Mn ions. Moreover, previous work has implied that a high-temperature quench ing treatment is possibly conducive to eliminate the Mn vacancies, which was reported by Komaba ’ s group designing distorted P2 0 -Na 0.67 MnO 2 with higher capacity than undistorted P2 - Na 0.67 MnO 2 [ 30 ], which represent a reasonable approach to synthesize a high-capacity Mn-based cathode material for NIBs [ 31–33 ]. However, such quenched samples still contain high content of Mn 3 þ ions entailing the notorious Jahn-Teller effect and thus multiphase transition during cycling and the enhanced long cycle performance of the material is missing in the work. Besides, a comprehensive study of the correlation between the cooling treatment and the structure of the material is also lacking. In this work, we propose a new approach to prepare Mn vacanciesfree Mn-based layered oxides cathode materials through a liquid N 2 lacking. In this work, we propose a new approach to prepare Mn vacanciesfree Mn-based layered oxides cathode materials through a liquid N 2 treatment. The rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (   196 � C) of liquid N 2 take the thermal energy away and freeze the material immediately, providing a superior quenching method to affect the inherent properties/structure of Mn-based layered oxides materials and further improve the specific capacity. Besides, an efficient strategy through low-cost Al and Fe co-doping is introduced to adjust the average valence of Mn ions and suppress biphasic structural transformations during Na þ (de)intercalation [ 33, 35 ]. The stronger Al - O bonding is beneficial to enlarging the spacing between the Na þ layers and stabilize the Na 0.67 MnO 2 structure as demonstrated in our previous work [ 35 ]. And a small amount of Fe-doping is confirmed to disrupt cations ordering and moderate the transition of P2 - O2 phases at high voltage, thus significantly enhancing cyclability of materials [ 33, 35 ]. Accord ingly, an optimized low-cost Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.9 O 2 material with both superior capacity and cycle performance is successfully prepared through this synergetic strategy including liquid N 2 quenching and aliovalent doping. Moreover, a systematic study on the correlation between the elec trochemical properties, long-range structure and local environment including the Mn ions average valence and structural distortion of the Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ ) materials via doping and different cooling processes (natural cooling, normal quenching and liquid N 2 quenching) is further understood by employing exand in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic reso nance (ss-NMR) and time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND). The results clearly reveal the superiority of the liquid N 2 quenching treatment, which can totally avoid the formation of TM va cancies and increase the atomic occupancy of Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center, thus leading to the highest specific capacity, Na þ mobility and electronic conductivity among the prepared samples. Furthermore, the influence of doping on the Mn ions average valence, degree of structural distortion and electrochemical properties is discussed in depth. As a result, our work poses the most fertile directions in the development of high energy and stable cycling NIBs cathode materials based on sustainable Mn element, and provides an ultrahigh performance and low-cost cathode material for NIBs. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Synthesis of materials The Na 0.67 MnO 2, Na 0.67 M 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ ) and Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 samples were prepared via a simple citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. A stoichiometric amount of NaNO 3 (with 3% excess of sodium, AR, � 99%), Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 � 4H 2 O (AR, � 99%) and doped ions source were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water, and LiNO 3 (AR, � 99%), Mg(NO 3 ) 2 � 6H 2 O (AR, � 99%), Al(NO 3 ) 3 � 9H 2 O (AR, � 99%) and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 � 9H 2 O (AR, � 99%) were used as Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ source, respectively. Then the mixed solution was added dropwise into a citric acid solution, and NH 3 ⋅ H 2 O (28%) was used to adjust the pH value to 7–8. The mixed solution was heated to 80 � C and stirred for 12 h to obtain a sol, then dried at 120 � C for 12 h to obtain a gel. The mixture was ground and heated at 450 � C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the powder was ground again and pressed into pellet, which was calcined at 900 � C for 15 h in air, and then sub jected to natural cooling (NC, average cooling rate: 0.8 � C min   1 ), quenching (QU, average cooling rate: 79.5 � C min   1 ) or liquid N 2 quenching (LN) to room temperature and finally stored in Ar-filled glove box. 2.2. Electrochemical tests � C min   1 ), quenching (QU, average cooling rate: 79.5 � C min   1 ) or liquid N 2 quenching (LN) to room temperature and finally stored in Ar-filled glove box. 2.2. Electrochemical tests Electrochemical experiments were carried out in 2032 coin-type cells. The working electrode was prepared by coating the slurry of the active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride in the weight ratio of 8:1:1 using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent onto an Al foil substrate and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 � C. The Na disks were made by rolling sodium chunks into thin sheets, which were then cut into circular plates and used as the counter electrode, and a glass fiber was used as the separator. The electrolyte was composed of a solution of 1 M NaClO 4 in propylene carbonate (PC) and fluoro ethylene carbonate (FEC) (95:5 by volume). The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged on a Neware CT-4008 battery test system at variable current X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 3 rates from 12 to 1200 mA g   1 (1200 mA g   1 1⁄4 5C). Rate capabilities tested by charging at 12 mA g   1 and discharging at the current densities ranging from 12 to 1200 mA g   1. For galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analyses, the cells were cycled at 24 mA g   1. The duration time for each applied galvanostatic current and rest was 5 and 50 min, respectively. 2.3. Material characterizations Rigaku Ultima IV and SmartLab-SE X-ray diffractometer were used to collect powder XRD and variable temperature XRD patterns, respec tively, using Cu K α radiation ( λ 1⁄4 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA from 10 to 80 � (2 θ ) at a scan speed of 2 � min   1 or 10 � min   1. Timeof-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND) was measured at the VULCAN instrument at the Spallation Neutron Sources (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The diffraction pattern was measured at the detector banks at 2 θ 1⁄4 � 90 �, equipped 5 mm receiving collimators. Neutron powder diffraction patterns were collected in the high intensity mode ( Δ d/d ~0.45%) for a duration of 2 h under the nominal 1.4 MW SNS operation, and then processed using VDRIVE software. Rietveld refinement of the XRD and ND patterns were performed using a General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program [ 36 ]. In-situ synchrotron XRD patterns were collected in a transmission mode at room tempera ture, using ion chamber detectors at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). For in-situ XRD, a standard CR2032 coin cell with small holes in each side was used to perform the experiment. Morphological features of the samples were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope(SEM) and a Philips-FEI Tecnai F20 scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM), oper ating at 200 kV. The exact compositions of Na, Mn, Al and Fe were determined by Optima 2000-DV inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer). The ss-NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The 23 Na MAS NMR spectra were acquired using a 1.3 mm double-resonance HX probe at a spinning rate of 55 kHz with a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (90 � pulse - τ - 180 � pulse - τ ) or pj-MATPASS pulse sequence. The 90 � pulse length for 23 Na was 1.2 μ s and the recycle delay used was 20 ms. The 23 Na chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M NaCl aqueous solution (0 ppm). The spin-spin relaxation (T 2 ) were also measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time. For direct-current polarization measurements, the fresh powders were compacted under 200 MPa pressure and subjected to various cooling treatments at room temperature. Both surface of pellets were polished and painted with aurum paste, and they were embedded in a stainless steel Swagelok cells to conduct electrical measurement [ 37 ]. The direct-current polarization measurements data were fitted by i 1⁄4 i ∞ þ ( i 0 i ∞ ) e -t/ τ. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Characterization of prepared materials A group of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 (NAFMO) materials were Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of naturally cooled, quenched and liquid N 2 quenched processes (left), and the effects of different cooling treatment on the vacancies of the electrode structures (right). X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 4 prepared by a sol-gel method followed by a cooling process. The syn thesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The precursor materials were sin tered at 900 � C for 15 h, and then exposed to three different cooling processes including natural cooling (NC), quenching (QU) and liquid N 2 (LN) quenching to 25 � C. Of note, liquid N 2 quenching method with rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (   196 � C) can freeze the samples immediately, providing much faster cooling rate and O 2 -free condition than normal quenching treatment. ICP-OES is employed to determine the stoichiometric ratios of NAFMO materials ( Table S1 ), which are consistent to the designed composition. The SEM images ( Figs. S1a - c ) are collected to reveal the morphologies of the prepared materials, exhibiting similar irregular polyhedron shape and smooth surface facets. Moreover, all of the prepared materials present a uniform distribution of Al, Fe and Mn elements and are shown in the TEM and EDS mapping results ( Fig. S1d -o). Nevertheless, NAFMO-NC, NAFMOQU and NAFMO-LN materials present the median particle size (D50) of 932.6, 756.5 and 742.3 nm ( Fig. S2 ), respectively, indicating the pri mary particle sizes decrease and the bulk diffusion length reduces with the increasing of cooling rate. Additionally, the XRD, TOF PND and ssNMR results demonstrate that the prepared NAFMO materials through different cooling process present very distinct atomic occupancy, local structure and even long-range structure. As shown in Fig. 2 a and S3, both of NAFMO-NC and NAFMO-QU materials exhibit a pure hexagonal layered crystalline structure of P2 phase with space group of P6 3 /mmc (PDF#27–0751), while the NAFMO-LN sample presents a distorted P2 phase (denoted as P2 ’, PDF#27–0752), which includes the standard diffraction patterns of P2 phase and four new diffraction peaks. These four peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase and the decreasing symmetry of crystal lattice, generating diffraction peaks at the relatively lower diffraction angle in comparison to the (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks from P2 phase. Due to the ordered arrangement of TM ions during natural cooling process, two honeycomb-superstructure peaks appear at ~22 � and ~32 � of NAFMOLN sample [ 16 ]. Here, in order to further describe the degree of distortion, the definition of δ is showed in Fig. S4, which is consistent with previous report [ 30 ]. The ratio of lattice constant of NAFMO-LN is calculated to be b ortho /a ortho 1⁄4 1.799, suggesting a slight distortion compared to b ortho /a ortho 1⁄4 1.830 of the P2 ’ phase Na 0.67 MnO 2 (S.G. Cmcm ), and the degree of distortion, δ, is estimated to be 2.9% (for the P2 ’ phase, δ 1⁄4 8%) [ 30 ]. The high-quality TOF PND data were further collected to investigate the existence of cations vacancies in the TM layers for its highly sensitivity to the distribution of atoms [ 38 ]. Rietveld refinements were performed with GSAS [ 36 ] and the results of the refined fractional atomic coordinates and atomic occupancy based on XRD and ND are presented in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively, which are highly consistent with each other and with low Rwp values. These results reveal that the atomic occupancies of TM ions in the NAFMO-NC, -QU and -LN samples are 0.922, 0.964 and 1, corresponding to the TM vacancies of 0.078, 0.035 and 0 in the TM layers ( Fig. 2 b), respectively. Moreover, the full atomic occupancy of Mn ions is expected to generate the lowest Mn ions average valence to satisfy the charge balance in NAFMO materials, which leads to the unequal Mn - O bonds and ortho rhombic distortion in the NAFMO-LN sample ( Fig. 1 and Table S4 ). Besides, the lattice parameters a, c and V increase continuously with the rising cooling rate ( Fig. S3 ), due to the larger ions radius of Mn 3 þ (0.645 Å) than Mn 4 þ Besides, the lattice parameters a, c and V increase continuously with the rising cooling rate ( Fig. S3 ), due to the larger ions radius of Mn 3 þ (0.645 Å) than Mn 4 þ (0.53 Å). More importantly, as shown in Table S3, the continuously expanded extent of Na þ layers spacing indicates that the faster cooling treatment would facilitate the Na þ insertion and extrac tion. In summary, our above results reveal that the long-range structure of materials is highly relevant to the cooling process, and a faster cooling treatment can suppress the formation of vacancy more effectively and thus increasing atomic occupancy of Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center in the TM layers. To thoroughly study the structure of the prepared materials, ss-NMR spectroscopy was employed, which is highly sensitive to the local and electronic environment of target nucleus. Previous works have concluded that the characteristic signal of P2 and P2 ’ phase with obvious orthorhombic distortion are at around 1250 and 850 ppm, respectively [ 34, 39 ]. Surprisingly, as presented in Fig. 2 c and S5, the 23 Na NMR spectra of the three materials only show one resonance signal at 1200–1450 ppm, even for the P2 ’ phase NAFMO-LN sample confirmed by XRD and TOF PND results. The results indicate that such a slight orthorhombic distortion of NAFMO-LN sample have no detectable effect on the local electronic environment of Na þ. Besides, all the spectra show a signal at around 0 ppm due to the diamagnetic sodium salts. Despite the chemical shifts and peak patterns for these three samples are Fig. 2. Structural characterization of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2.

(d - f) Rietveld refinements of TOF PND patterns for the asprepared samples. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 5 similar, the full width at half maximum for NAFMO-NC (97.49 ppm) sample is significantly broader than that for NAFMO-QU (64.99 ppm) and NAFMO-LN (64.88 ppm) samples ( Fig. S5 ), which indicates that the uniformity of the Na þ local environment improves when accelerating the cooling rate. The local environment of Na þ is highly affected by the number of surrounding Mn ions though Na - O - Mn pathways and the presence of TM ions vacancies increases the types of local environment. Moreover, a higher content of paramagnetic Mn ions will cause a stronger Fermi-contact interaction around Na þ and thus a large chemi cal shift [ 40 ]. The resonance of NAFMO-QU sample locates at a larger chemical shift than that of the NAFMO-NC sample ( Fig. 2 c), which further confirm Mn atomic occupancy of NAFMO-QU is higher than that of NAFMO-NC sample. Additionally, the resonance shifts slightly to a lower chemical shift for the NAFMO-LN sample than NAFMO-QU sam ple, owing to the much longer Mn - O bonds in orthorhombic distortion phase ( Fig. 1 and Table S4 ) and consequently the Fermi-contact inter action around Na þ decreased. To further reveal the effects of different cooling rates on the Na þ (de) intercalation, dynamics of NAFMO-NC/QU/LN materials, T 2 (spin spin relaxation times) were obtained by the Hahn-echo method and the fitted results are showed in Fig. 3 a. For the paramagnetic solid-state materials, T 2 can eliminate the influence of transition metal ions and the faster Na þ hopping rate leads to longer T 2 value [ 41, 42 ]. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the T 2 value continuously increases with rising the cooling rate and reaches the highest value of 103 μ s for the NAFMO-LN sample, which is assigned to the largest Na þ layers spacing ( Table S4 ) and the fastest Na þ hopping rate. Besides, the electronic conductivity, as another important param eter for evaluating electrode materials, was measured by direct-current polarization method, and the results are showed in Fig. 3 c - d. The ob tained electronic conductivity of 3.812 x 10   5 S cm   1 for NAFMO-LN sample is higher than the NAFMO-QU sample (3.227 x 10   5 S cm   1 ) and much higher than NAFMO-NC sample (9.790 x 10   6 S cm   1 ), which may be attributed to the increasing contents of Mn 3 þ promoting electron hopping [ 37 ]. Thus, an excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN sam ple is expected, due to the fastest Na þ mobility and highest electronic conductivity. The above results have shown that the long-range and local structure of materials are closely related to the cooling rate during the synthesis process. Next, the XRD patterns at variable temperature were performed for a better understanding of the structure evolution during cooling process. Specifically, the precursor was firstly heated up to 900 � C for 15 h in air, and then slowly cooled down to each temperature point. As shown in Fig. S6, the XRD patterns reveal that the material at 900 � C matches well with the standard patterns of P2 ’ phase, attributed to the low average valence of Mn ions thus leading to an orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase as commented before [ 29 ]. As the temperature decreases, the characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with “ y “ ) of P2 ’ phase are reduced in intensity and they are consecutively shifted to slightly higher diffraction angles due to the contraction of ab plane. The fact corresponds the disappearance of the orthorhombic distortion and the increasing of Mn ions average valence. As the temperature is cooled down to 800 � C and beneath, only P2 phase is observed and its diffraction signals fit perfectly the standard patterns of P2 phase, probably due to the fact that the crystal lattice tends to uptake oxygen in the cooling process [ 29 ]. The XRD data obtained at variable temperature fully reveal that the structure of the material subjected at different the cooling process [ 29 ]. The XRD data obtained at variable temperature fully reveal that the structure of the material subjected at different temperature during cooling process could be obtained by appropriately controlling the cooling rate, and the faster cooling treatment promote maintaining the structure of high-temperature (900 � C). 3.2.

Electronic conductivity is calculated by i ∞ and Ohm ’ s law. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 6 materials was evaluated in Na half cells at 30 � C. The galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of the electrodes within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at 12 mA g   1 (0.05C) current rate are shown in Fig. 4 a. As the cooling rate for the prepared materials increases, the following charac teristics of first cycle curves deserve special attention: (i) These three samples exhibit smooth charge-discharge profiles, confirming multiple phase transition and Na þ -vacancy ordering during (de)intercalation processes have been suppressed by the introduction of Al and Fe ele ments. While the plateaus at ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V become more obvious with increase of cooling rate, which are related to phase transition processes and will be discussed in the next section. (ii) The open circuit voltages ( Fig. S7 ) of the electrodes decrease continuously with the increasing of cooling rate, corresponding to the decrease of Mn ions average valence. (iii) The initial discharge capacities are 131, 175 and 202 mAh g   1 for NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN, respec tively. They are significantly improved with the accelerating cooling rate. To the best our knowledge, NAFMO-LN material has shown the highest initial discharge capacity and specific energy density (~527 Wh kg   1, solely considering the mass of cathode active material) among reported P2-type sodium oxides materials in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. Furthermore, as the working window is expanded to 1.5–4.5 V ( Fig. S8 ), the capacities delivered by NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN are 210, 224 and 246 mA g   1, respectively, while an obvious plateau attributing to anionic redox reaction appears at ~4.2 V [ 17, 43, 44 ]. As indicated above, the anionic charge compensation pro cess usually shows the poor cyclabilities and slow dynamics in both sodium cathode materials and Li-analogues, so we mainly focus on the working potential below 4 V. In order to meet the needs of the market of smart grids, the requirement for the discharge rates of NIBs is much higher. The rate capabilities were tested by charging at low current and discharging at various currents, the same as previous researches [ 33, 35, 39 ], and the results are shown in Fig. 4 b - c. NAFMO-LN electrode shows the highest capacities and stable cyclabilities at each current density, providing the capacities of 202, 191, 173, 161 and 148 mAh g   1 as the discharge current densities are increased from 12, 24, 120, 240–480 mA g   1, respectively. Even with the 100 times increase of the current den sity (1200 mA g   1 ), the capacity retention is up to 60% (122 mAh g   1 ), indicating excellent rate capability among the reported high-rate P2-type electrodes. The diffusion coefficients of Na þ were calculated from GITT results to evaluate the (de)intercalation of kinetics of Na þ during first cycle. As shown in Fig. S9, the geomean D Na þ of NAFMO-LN (2.474 � 10   10 cm² s   1 ) is slight higher than NAFMO-QU (2.196 � 10   10 cm² s   1 ) and is much higher than that of NAFMO-NC (5.107 � 10   11 cm² s   1 ), which is consistent with the best rate performance of liquid N 2 treatment sample. In addition, the cycle stabilities of the ma terials are also investigated at different current densities of 12 and 1200 mA g   1 as shown in Fig. S10 and 4d, respectively. At the current density of 12 mA g   1, NAFMO-LN electrode delivers the highest initial discharge capacity of 202 mAh g   1 and the highest maintained capacity of 198 mAh g   1 after ten cycles without any electrode modifications. Espe cially, the excellent reversibility and negligible voltage change are found in the charge-discharge curves of NAFMO-LN electrodes. Due to the excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current rate of 1200 mA g   1 excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current rate of 1200 mA g   1. As shown in Fig. 4 d and S11, it also maintains the initial capacity of 122 mAh g   1 and the long cycling stability is achieved with the remarkable capacity retentions of 98% after 100 cycles, 95% after 200 cycles and 81% after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g   1 with ~100% coulombic efficiency during cycling. The plateaus of ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V are substantial reduction from the comparison dQ/dV curves at low (12 mA g   1 ) and high (1200 mA g   1 ) current densities, especially the plateau at low voltage which is deemed as the main reason for the ca pacity decays due to the notorious Mn 3 þ Jahn-Teller effects. Ex-situ 23 Na NMR was further performed to explore the structure evolutions at high current density. As shown in Fig. S12, the P2 phase signal is maintained during the whole charge process, and thus the electrode could exhibit Fig. 4.

The best rate performance and outstanding overall electro chemical properties of NAFMO-LN electrode demonstrate a potential competitive advantage to the general P2 cathodes. Fig. 5.

Long-range and local structural transformations during (De) Sodiation processes In-situ synchrotron XRD was employed to track the long-range structural transformations of NAFMO-LN electrode induced by the (de)intercalation of Na þ at a rate current of 24 mA g   1. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the XRD patterns have been divided into four stages to clarify the structure evolution process more clearly. The (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks are retained during the whole process, corresponding to a quasi-solid-solution reaction rather than typically multiple-phases transition reaction according to the previous reports [ 45,46 ]. As indi cated above, the prepared electrode is assigned to a P2 0 I phase, which exhibits a slight orthorhombic distortion from P2 phase. At the begin ning of charge process, the (020) peak reduces in intensity and shifts to higher angle, corresponding to the decrease of distortion degree, and a P2 phase is formed at x 1⁄4 0.40. Afterwards, a board peak is observed at the higher diffraction angle of 9 � at the end of charge process, owing to the formation of small amount of O-type stacking in the P2 structure. As reported by Bruce ’ s group, this process should be indicated as a “ Z ” phase evolved by the intergrowth mechanism, which have been mentioned in many P2 compounds, especially those containing Fe 3 þ [ 35, 47, 48 ]. The formation of “ Z ” phase is more moderate than O2 phase at high voltage, as the lattice parameter changes are smaller in magni tude and less abrupt, leading to a stable structure and better capacity retention [ 49 ]. The structural evolution is highly reversible during discharge. Of note, the (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks of P2 phase maintain in the rest of the discharge process, rather than replaced by that of typical P2 ’ phase with high degree of orthorhombic distortion (denoted as P2 ’ II). As the x equals 0.79, the characteristic signals of P2 ’ II phase are presented in both in-situ XRD and ss-NMR ( Fig. 5 b) results. However, such a moderate phase transition also makes it hard to distinguish between the P2 ’ I and P2 ’ II phase from in-situ XRD results. As shown in Fig. 5 b, the local environment information of the elec trode materials can be observed through 23 Na MAS NMR spectra, since Na þ directly participates in the electrochemical reaction in NIBs. 23 Na 1D slices were extracted from²D projection-MATPASS (pj-MATPASS) NMR spectra to eliminate the sideband signals [ 50 ]. Consistent with the powder sample, the ss-NMR spectrum of NAFMO-LN pristine electrode also shows the resonance signals at ~1250 ppm and ~0 ppm, rather than monoclinic and hydrated phases that usually occur during elec trode prepared process, suggesting that P2 ’ I phase is stable and structural transitions do not occur during electrode preparing procedure [ 34, 51 ]. During initial charge and discharge processes, the chemical shift of the signal moves to the high and low value gradually, corre spongding to the increase and decrease of the Mn ions average valence, respectively. The local structural evolution is in good agreement with the results of in situ XRD. When the x 1⁄4 0.32, the amount of local environment significantly increases because of the glide of MnO 2 layers, a wide peak at ~1100 ppm emerges, corresponding to the “ Z ” phase. Besides, the P2 phase signal can also be observed at the high voltage and decrease in intensity with “ Z ” phase emerging, which further proves the formation of “ Z ” phase is an intermediate and moderate process evolving intergrowth of P2 and O2 phases. The local structure is also highly reversible in discharge process. In x 1⁄4 0.78, the characteristic signal of P2 ’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distin guished from the signal of P2 ’ I phase. Besides, the P2 ’ II phase signal signal of P2 ’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distin guished from the signal of P2 ’ I phase. Besides, the P2 ’ II phase signal of NAFMO-LN sample is much broader than that of non-doped P2 0 -Na 0.67 MnO 2 materials while similar to the stable P2 - Na 0.67 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 and P2 - Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 materials in previ ous works [ 34, 39 ], corresponding to a much more moderate structure transition and thus better cycle performance. 3.4. Effects of various doping elements on structural and electrochemical properties of materials In order to give some illustration on the significance of the work, the Mn ions average valence of layered oxide materias have been adjusted by introducting different valence doping element, e.g. the introduction of Li þ is expected to rise 3 folds molar equivalents of Mn 3 þ to Mn 4 þ, and 2 folds for Mg 2 þ and equal amount for Al 3 þ. Therefore, Na 0.67 M 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ ) and non-doped materials were also prepared via the same synthesis process to further reveal the rela tionship between the Mn oxidation state, structure and electrochemical properties. The longand short-range structural information are showed in Fig. 6. The obvious orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase can been found in non-doped NMO-QU/-LN and Al 3 þ -doped NAMO-LN samples with exhibiting the characteristic signals of P2 ’ phase in both XRD patterns and ss-NMR spectra. Also, orthorhombic distortion is observed for Mg 2 þ -doped NMMO-LN sample, just like the above results of NAFMO-LN sample. While the Li þ -doped NLMO samples do not show any distortion in both longand short-structure by each cooling treat ment. Besides, the full width at half maximum of P2 phase also become narrow continuously with the faster cooling treatment for each prepared material. The above results indicate that the orthorhombic distortion tends to exist in the materials with low theoretical manganese valence and TM vacancies can be suppressed for P2 type Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 by the faster cooling treatment, and then exhibiting a more uniform local environment. A comparison of the electrochemical performance of non-doped and doped Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials (Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ ) prepared by NC, QU and LN methods is shown in Fig. 6 a - e. The initial charge and discharge capacities of all prepared materials increase significantly with the accelerating cooling rate, and the maximum capacity is obtained by liquid N 2 quenching (LN) treatment for all samples, demonstrating that the rapid cooling treatment can eliminate Mn vacancies, increase redox centers, and effectively improve the capacity of P2 type Na 0.67 M x Mn 1x O 2. Moreover, Fig. 7 f and S13 show that the cycle stablity of Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials is highly related to the Mn ions average valence in the materials except for NAFMO-LN sample, which exhibits optimal electrochemical performance through the synergy effect of Al and Fe co-doping [ 32, 33 ]. The lower Mn ions average valence causes more severe orthorhombic distortion in Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 and thus being detrimental to cyclability, e.g. the highest specific capacity (215 mAh g   1, 2–4 V) but lowest capacity retention of non-doped NMO-LN (Mn þ 3.33, δ 1⁄4 5.59%) sample, exhibiting many small plateau in galva nostatic charge-discharge curves. In contrast, the doped samples exhibit much smoother charge-discharge profiles, which evidences that the introduction of non-electrochemically active element disrupt the TM ordering in the TM layers and hamper Na þ -vacancy ordering during cycling [ 13 ]. The 10 mol% of Li-doping material presents a pure P2 phase without any lattice distortion and a stable cycling performance. However, even with liquid N 2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mn þ 3.59, δ 1⁄4 0%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g   1. There However, even with liquid N 2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mn þ 3.59, δ 1⁄4 0%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g   1. There fore, a rational element substitution should be implemented to mitigate Jahn-Teller effect and make a balance bewteen the capacity and cycle stablity to achieve superior electrochemical performance. Thus, the optimal co-doped NAFMO-LN material, with moderate initial Mn ions valence (Mn þ 3.39 ) and slight distortion ( δ 1⁄4 2.91%), shows not only an outstanding capacity of 202 mAh g   1 at voltage range of 2–4 V, but also a satifactory cyclability of 90.4% after 30 cycles at 12 mA g   1. 4. Conclusion In summary, our comparative results obtained in Na cells of nondoped and doped Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials with Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ prepared via different cooling processes is verified by using the combination of in-situ synchrotron XRD, TOF PND and ss-NMR mea surements. They reveal that a simple liquid N 2 quenching treatment X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 9 Fig. 6. (a - d) Powder XRD and (e - h) ss-NMR spectra of Li þ -doped, Mg 2 þ -doped, Al 3 þ -doped and non-doped Na 0.67 MnO 2 materials with different cooling treatment. Na 0.67 Li 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2, Na 0.67 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2, Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 and Na 0.67 MnO 2 are denoted as NLMO, NMMO, NAMO and NMO, respectively. The spinning sideband signal and the characteristic signal of orthorhombic distortion are marked with “ * “ and ” z “, respectively. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 10 could be regarded as a genaral synergetic strategy to control the for mation of vacancy in TM layers and thus to enhance Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center. Consequently, the deliverable capacity of all the Mn-based Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials can be signifcantly improved below 4.0 V, eliminating the factors responsible of capacity dacay such as electrolyte decomposition, structural collapse and oxygen loss at high voltgate. The ss-NMR, GITT and direct-current polarization results demonstrate the highest Na þ mobility and electronic conductivity for the liquid N 2 quenching sample, among the three different cooling rate samples. Moreover, we introduced Al and Fe, the top two earth abundance metal elements into TM layers to form the cost-effective Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 compound. After liquid N 2 quenching, the slightly dis torted Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 delivers a remarkable capacity of 202 and 246 mAh g   1 within 2.0–4.0 V and 1.5–4.5 V, respectively. Even with 100 times higher current density (1200 mA g   1 ), the specific capacity remains up to 122 mAh g   1 over 600 cycles with 81% capacity retention, indicating exceptional rate and power capabilities with excellent cycling stability. The outstanding overall performance of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.2 material demonstrated the synergetic strategy of liquid N 2 quenching treatment and rational element substitution, which can be used as a general guide for the further development of high ca pacity, high power and stable cycling materials, especially for Mn-based layered electrodes in NIBs.

In this work, we propose an effective strategy by a combination of liquid N 2 quenching and aliovalent doping to get new layered cathode materials. As evidenced by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction and solid-state 23 Na nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the proposed synthesis methods allow tuning the transition metal ions vacancies and enhance Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center of P2-type Mnbased materials. Our results demonstrate that such an optimized structure significantly enhances the deliverable capacity, Na þ mobility and electronic conductivity of the materials. Furthermore, the effects of aliovalent doping elements and different cooling approaches on the long-range structure, local environment and electrochemical performance are comprehensively studied by comparing a wide range of doped Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li, Mg, Al, Fe) materials. The optimized Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 material exhibits a remarkably high initial capacity of 202 mAh g   1 among ever reported P2-type layered oxides within 2–4 V, a stable capacity retention of 81% after 600 cycles and outstanding rate capability of the specific capacity up to 122 mAh g   1 at 1200 mA g   1. 1. Introduction The rapid development of intelligent and environmental-friendly industrial technology, including smart mobile phone and green elec tric vehicles, has made rechargeable batteries an indispensable part of our modern society [ 1, 2 ]. Among various energy storage systems, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with superior high energy and power den sities performance have accounted for the key position [ 3 ]. Neverthe less, the low reserve and uneven distribution of Li resources, and the use of high-cost and toxicity of Co and Ni as redox center for mostly LIBs cathode materials fail to fulfill demands of sustainable development [ 4 ]. Recently, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted many interests and are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact that sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural abundance than lithium [ 5, 6 ]. are considered as the most promising candidate of LIBs, due to the fact that sodium possesses similar chemical properties and higher natural abundance than lithium [ 5, 6 ]. In the development of NIBs, cathode is the most critical component that restricts cost and energy density in the full batteries [ 7, 8 ]. Comparing to polyanionic and tunnel-type cathodes materials for NIBs, layered transition metal oxides (Na x MO 2, M 1⁄4 transition metal) are extensively studied because of their high theoretical specific capacity * Corresponding author.

Among them, the low-cost Mn-based layered materials are deemed as ideal cathodes for large-scale energy storage. Two types of stacking structures, O3(ABCABC stacking) and P2(AABB stacking) are frequently observed in most of as-synthesized Na x MnO 2 materials within layered structure materials [ 10 ]. In comparison to the (de)sodiation of O3-type materials via the interstitial tetrahedral sites with relatively higher hopping energy from one octahedral site to another, the P2-type phase allows a direct migration between adjacent prismatic sites, thus enabling rapid Na þ transport and showing better applicability [ 11 ]. However, the available capacities of P2-type cathode materials are still insufficient yet [ 12, 13 ]. To address this issue, anionic redox reaction is introduced as its Li counterpart, which can be triggered to get extra capacity by charging the cells to a higher voltage range of 4.0–4.5 V vs. Na þ /Na (4.3–4.8 V vs. Li þ /Li). Unfortunately, the cathode materials inevitably suffer from electrolyte decomposition, multiple phase transition and even oxygen loss at such a high voltage, resulting in obvious voltage hysteresis and rapid capacity fade [ 14–17 ]. In contrast, controlling the cut-off voltage lower than 4 V for P2-type cathode can effectively eliminate aforementioned shortages and yield a much better cyclability, but the reversible capacity is hardly higher than 175 mAh g   1 [ 18–22 ]. Recent investigations have focused on the optimization of the crys talline/local structures and morphology engineering of Na x MnO 2 by adjusting the Na/Mn ratio, sintering temperature, cooling rate and aliovalent doping [ 20–25 ], which further determine the electrochemical performance. However, the overall performance of the materials is far below our expectation. The understanding of underlying structure-property relationship of the materials, especially the local environment including Mn vacancies, is insufficient for obtaining the material with high capacity and long cycle performance. The formation of Mn vacancies in the transition metal (TM) layers have been observed over 40 years [ 26–29 ]. Parant et al. proposed that Na 0.67 MnO 2 is able to uptake oxygen during the cooling process [ 27 ], resulting in the lift of Mn ions oxidation state and the formation of manganese deficient phases (denoted as □ ): Na 0.67 MnO 2 þ y/2 O 2 → Na 0.67 MnO 2 þ y (Na 0.67/(1 þ y/2) Mn 1/(1 þ y/2) □ (y/2)/(1 þ y/ 2) O 2 ) The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of Dahn ’ s group showed a reversible mass gain and decline which are related to the oxygen uptake and release during cooling and heating, respectively [ 29 ]. The above works demonstrated that Mn vacancies are inclined to form during cooling process and then adjust the valence of Mn ions. Moreover, previous work has implied that a high-temperature quench ing treatment is possibly conducive to eliminate the Mn vacancies, which was reported by Komaba ’ s group designing distorted P2 0 -Na 0.67 MnO 2 with higher capacity than undistorted P2 - Na 0.67 MnO 2 [ 30 ], which represent a reasonable approach to synthesize a high-capacity Mn-based cathode material for NIBs [ 31–33 ]. However, such quenched samples still contain high content of Mn 3 þ ions entailing the notorious Jahn-Teller effect and thus multiphase transition during cycling and the enhanced long cycle performance of the material is missing in the work. Besides, a comprehensive study of the correlation between the cooling treatment and the structure of the material is also lacking. In this work, we propose a new approach to prepare Mn vacanciesfree Mn-based layered oxides cathode materials through a liquid N 2 lacking. In this work, we propose a new approach to prepare Mn vacanciesfree Mn-based layered oxides cathode materials through a liquid N 2 treatment. The rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (   196 � C) of liquid N 2 take the thermal energy away and freeze the material immediately, providing a superior quenching method to affect the inherent properties/structure of Mn-based layered oxides materials and further improve the specific capacity. Besides, an efficient strategy through low-cost Al and Fe co-doping is introduced to adjust the average valence of Mn ions and suppress biphasic structural transformations during Na þ (de)intercalation [ 33, 35 ]. The stronger Al - O bonding is beneficial to enlarging the spacing between the Na þ layers and stabilize the Na 0.67 MnO 2 structure as demonstrated in our previous work [ 35 ]. And a small amount of Fe-doping is confirmed to disrupt cations ordering and moderate the transition of P2 - O2 phases at high voltage, thus significantly enhancing cyclability of materials [ 33, 35 ]. Accord ingly, an optimized low-cost Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.9 O 2 material with both superior capacity and cycle performance is successfully prepared through this synergetic strategy including liquid N 2 quenching and aliovalent doping. Moreover, a systematic study on the correlation between the elec trochemical properties, long-range structure and local environment including the Mn ions average valence and structural distortion of the Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ ) materials via doping and different cooling processes (natural cooling, normal quenching and liquid N 2 quenching) is further understood by employing exand in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state nuclear magnetic reso nance (ss-NMR) and time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND). The results clearly reveal the superiority of the liquid N 2 quenching treatment, which can totally avoid the formation of TM va cancies and increase the atomic occupancy of Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center, thus leading to the highest specific capacity, Na þ mobility and electronic conductivity among the prepared samples. Furthermore, the influence of doping on the Mn ions average valence, degree of structural distortion and electrochemical properties is discussed in depth. As a result, our work poses the most fertile directions in the development of high energy and stable cycling NIBs cathode materials based on sustainable Mn element, and provides an ultrahigh performance and low-cost cathode material for NIBs. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Synthesis of materials The Na 0.67 MnO 2, Na 0.67 M 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ ) and Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 samples were prepared via a simple citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. A stoichiometric amount of NaNO 3 (with 3% excess of sodium, AR, � 99%), Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 � 4H 2 O (AR, � 99%) and doped ions source were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water, and LiNO 3 (AR, � 99%), Mg(NO 3 ) 2 � 6H 2 O (AR, � 99%), Al(NO 3 ) 3 � 9H 2 O (AR, � 99%) and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 � 9H 2 O (AR, � 99%) were used as Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ source, respectively. Then the mixed solution was added dropwise into a citric acid solution, and NH 3 ⋅ H 2 O (28%) was used to adjust the pH value to 7–8. The mixed solution was heated to 80 � C and stirred for 12 h to obtain a sol, then dried at 120 � C for 12 h to obtain a gel. The mixture was ground and heated at 450 � C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the powder was ground again and pressed into pellet, which was calcined at 900 � C for 15 h in air, and then sub jected to natural cooling (NC, average cooling rate: 0.8 � C min   1 ), quenching (QU, average cooling rate: 79.5 � C min   1 ) or liquid N 2 quenching (LN) to room temperature and finally stored in Ar-filled glove box. 2.2.

Electrochemical tests Electrochemical experiments were carried out in 2032 coin-type cells. The working electrode was prepared by coating the slurry of the active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride in the weight ratio of 8:1:1 using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent onto an Al foil substrate and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 120 � C. The Na disks were made by rolling sodium chunks into thin sheets, which were then cut into circular plates and used as the counter electrode, and a glass fiber was used as the separator. The electrolyte was composed of a solution of 1 M NaClO 4 in propylene carbonate (PC) and fluoro ethylene carbonate (FEC) (95:5 by volume). The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged on a Neware CT-4008 battery test system at variable current X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 3 rates from 12 to 1200 mA g   1 (1200 mA g   1 1⁄4 5C). Rate capabilities tested by charging at 12 mA g   1 and discharging at the current densities ranging from 12 to 1200 mA g   1. For galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analyses, the cells were cycled at 24 mA g   1. The duration time for each applied galvanostatic current and rest was 5 and 50 min, respectively. 2.3. Material characterizations Rigaku Ultima IV and SmartLab-SE X-ray diffractometer were used to collect powder XRD and variable temperature XRD patterns, respec tively, using Cu K α radiation ( λ 1⁄4 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA from 10 to 80 � (2 θ ) at a scan speed of 2 � min   1 or 10 � min   1. Timeof-flight powder neutron diffraction (TOF PND) was measured at the VULCAN instrument at the Spallation Neutron Sources (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The diffraction pattern was measured at the detector banks at 2 θ 1⁄4 � 90 �, equipped 5 mm receiving collimators. Neutron powder diffraction patterns were collected in the high intensity mode ( Δ d/d ~0.45%) for a duration of 2 h under the nominal 1.4 MW SNS operation, and then processed using VDRIVE software. Rietveld refinement of the XRD and ND patterns were performed using a General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program [ 36 ]. In-situ synchrotron XRD patterns were collected in a transmission mode at room tempera ture, using ion chamber detectors at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). For in-situ XRD, a standard CR2032 coin cell with small holes in each side was used to perform the experiment. Morphological features of the samples were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope(SEM) and a Philips-FEI Tecnai F20 scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM), oper ating at 200 kV. The exact compositions of Na, Mn, Al and Fe were determined by Optima 2000-DV inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer). The ss-NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The 23 Na MAS NMR spectra were acquired using a 1.3 mm double-resonance HX probe at a spinning rate of 55 kHz with a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (90 � pulse - τ - 180 � pulse - τ ) or pj-MATPASS pulse sequence. The 90 � pulse length for 23 Na was 1.2 μ s and the recycle delay used was 20 ms. The 23 Na chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M NaCl aqueous solution (0 ppm). The spin-spin relaxation (T 2 ) were also measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time. For direct-current polarization measurements, the fresh powders were compacted under 200 MPa pressure and subjected to various cooling treatments at room temperature. Both surface of pellets were polished and painted with aurum paste, and they were embedded in a stainless steel Swagelok cells to conduct electrical measurement [ 37 ]. The direct-current polarization measurements data were fitted by i 1⁄4 i ∞ þ ( i 0 i ∞ ) e -t/ τ. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Characterization of prepared materials A group of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 (NAFMO) materials were Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of naturally cooled, quenched and liquid N 2 quenched processes (left), and the effects of different cooling treatment on the vacancies of the electrode structures (right). X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 4 prepared by a sol-gel method followed by a cooling process. The syn thesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1. The precursor materials were sin tered at 900 � C for 15 h, and then exposed to three different cooling processes including natural cooling (NC), quenching (QU) and liquid N 2 (LN) quenching to 25 � C. Of note, liquid N 2 quenching method with rapid evaporation and extremely low temperatures (   196 � C) can freeze the samples immediately, providing much faster cooling rate and O 2 -free condition than normal quenching treatment. ICP-OES is employed to determine the stoichiometric ratios of NAFMO materials ( Table S1 ), which are consistent to the designed composition. The SEM images ( Figs. S1a - c ) are collected to reveal the morphologies of the prepared materials, exhibiting similar irregular polyhedron shape and smooth surface facets. Moreover, all of the prepared materials present a uniform distribution of Al, Fe and Mn elements and are shown in the TEM and EDS mapping results ( Fig. S1d -o). Nevertheless, NAFMO-NC, NAFMOQU and NAFMO-LN materials present the median particle size (D50) of 932.6, 756.5 and 742.3 nm ( Fig. S2 ), respectively, indicating the pri mary particle sizes decrease and the bulk diffusion length reduces with the increasing of cooling rate. Additionally, the XRD, TOF PND and ssNMR results demonstrate that the prepared NAFMO materials through different cooling process present very distinct atomic occupancy, local structure and even long-range structure. As shown in Fig. 2 a and S3, both of NAFMO-NC and NAFMO-QU materials exhibit a pure hexagonal layered crystalline structure of P2 phase with space group of P6 3 /mmc (PDF#27–0751), while the NAFMO-LN sample presents a distorted P2 phase (denoted as P2 ’, PDF#27–0752), which includes the standard diffraction patterns of P2 phase and four new diffraction peaks. These four peaks are attributed to the orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase and the decreasing symmetry of crystal lattice, generating diffraction peaks at the relatively lower diffraction angle in comparison to the (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks from P2 phase. Due to the ordered arrangement of TM ions during natural cooling process, two honeycomb-superstructure peaks appear at ~22 � and ~32 � of NAFMOLN sample [ 16 ]. Here, in order to further describe the degree of distortion, the definition of δ is showed in Fig. S4, which is consistent with previous report [ 30 ]. The ratio of lattice constant of NAFMO-LN is calculated to be b ortho /a ortho 1⁄4 1.799, suggesting a slight distortion compared to b ortho /a ortho 1⁄4 1.830 of the P2 ’ phase Na 0.67 MnO 2 (S.G. Cmcm ), and the degree of distortion, δ, is estimated to be 2.9% (for the P2 ’ phase, δ 1⁄4 8%) [ 30 ]. The high-quality TOF PND data were further collected to investigate the existence of cations vacancies in the TM layers for its highly sensitivity to the distribution of atoms [ 38 ]. Rietveld refinements were performed with GSAS [ 36 ] and the results of the refined fractional atomic coordinates and atomic occupancy based on XRD and ND are presented in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively, which are highly consistent with each other and with low Rwp values. These results reveal that the atomic occupancies of TM ions in the NAFMO-NC, -QU and -LN samples are 0.922, 0.964 and 1, corresponding to the TM vacancies of 0.078, 0.035 and 0 in the TM layers ( Fig. 2 b), respectively. Moreover, the full atomic occupancy of Mn ions is expected to generate the lowest Mn ions average valence to satisfy the charge balance in NAFMO materials, which leads to the unequal Mn - O bonds and ortho rhombic distortion in the NAFMO-LN sample ( Fig. 1 and Table S4 ). Besides, the lattice parameters a, c and V increase continuously with the rising cooling rate ( Fig. S3 ), due to the larger ions radius of Mn 3 þ (0.645 Å) than Mn 4 þ Besides, the lattice parameters a, c and V increase continuously with the rising cooling rate ( Fig. S3 ), due to the larger ions radius of Mn 3 þ (0.645 Å) than Mn 4 þ (0.53 Å). More importantly, as shown in Table S3, the continuously expanded extent of Na þ layers spacing indicates that the faster cooling treatment would facilitate the Na þ insertion and extrac tion. In summary, our above results reveal that the long-range structure of materials is highly relevant to the cooling process, and a faster cooling treatment can suppress the formation of vacancy more effectively and thus increasing atomic occupancy of Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center in the TM layers. To thoroughly study the structure of the prepared materials, ss-NMR spectroscopy was employed, which is highly sensitive to the local and electronic environment of target nucleus. Previous works have concluded that the characteristic signal of P2 and P2 ’ phase with obvious orthorhombic distortion are at around 1250 and 850 ppm, respectively [ 34, 39 ]. Surprisingly, as presented in Fig. 2 c and S5, the 23 Na NMR spectra of the three materials only show one resonance signal at 1200–1450 ppm, even for the P2 ’ phase NAFMO-LN sample confirmed by XRD and TOF PND results. The results indicate that such a slight orthorhombic distortion of NAFMO-LN sample have no detectable effect on the local electronic environment of Na þ. Besides, all the spectra show a signal at around 0 ppm due to the diamagnetic sodium salts. Despite the chemical shifts and peak patterns for these three samples are Fig. 2. Structural characterization of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2. (a) Powder XRD patterns, (b) the atomic occupancy fitting results of TM ions from TOF PND data, and (c) 23 Na ss-NMR spectra of the prepared materials and the asterisks (*) indicate the spinning sidebands. (d - f) Rietveld refinements of TOF PND patterns for the asprepared samples. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 5 similar, the full width at half maximum for NAFMO-NC (97.49 ppm) sample is significantly broader than that for NAFMO-QU (64.99 ppm) and NAFMO-LN (64.88 ppm) samples ( Fig. S5 ), which indicates that the uniformity of the Na þ local environment improves when accelerating the cooling rate. The local environment of Na þ is highly affected by the number of surrounding Mn ions though Na - O - Mn pathways and the presence of TM ions vacancies increases the types of local environment. Moreover, a higher content of paramagnetic Mn ions will cause a stronger Fermi-contact interaction around Na þ and thus a large chemi cal shift [ 40 ]. The resonance of NAFMO-QU sample locates at a larger chemical shift than that of the NAFMO-NC sample ( Fig. 2 c), which further confirm Mn atomic occupancy of NAFMO-QU is higher than that of NAFMO-NC sample. Additionally, the resonance shifts slightly to a lower chemical shift for the NAFMO-LN sample than NAFMO-QU sam ple, owing to the much longer Mn - O bonds in orthorhombic distortion phase ( Fig. 1 and Table S4 ) and consequently the Fermi-contact inter action around Na þ decreased. To further reveal the effects of different cooling rates on the Na þ (de) intercalation, dynamics of NAFMO-NC/QU/LN materials, T 2 (spin spin relaxation times) were obtained by the Hahn-echo method and the fitted results are showed in Fig. 3 a. For the paramagnetic solid-state materials, T 2 can eliminate the influence of transition metal ions and the faster Na þ hopping rate leads to longer T 2 value [ 41, 42 ]. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the T 2 value continuously increases with rising the cooling rate and reaches the highest value of 103 μ s for the NAFMO-LN sample, which is assigned to the largest Na þ layers spacing ( Table S4 ) and the fastest Na þ hopping rate. Besides, the electronic conductivity, as another important param eter for evaluating electrode materials, was measured by direct-current polarization method, and the results are showed in Fig. 3 c - d. The ob tained electronic conductivity of 3.812 x 10   5 S cm   1 for NAFMO-LN sample is higher than the NAFMO-QU sample (3.227 x 10   5 S cm   1 ) and much higher than NAFMO-NC sample (9.790 x 10   6 S cm   1 ), which may be attributed to the increasing contents of Mn 3 þ promoting electron hopping [ 37 ]. Thus, an excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN sam ple is expected, due to the fastest Na þ mobility and highest electronic conductivity. The above results have shown that the long-range and local structure of materials are closely related to the cooling rate during the synthesis process. Next, the XRD patterns at variable temperature were performed for a better understanding of the structure evolution during cooling process. Specifically, the precursor was firstly heated up to 900 � C for 15 h in air, and then slowly cooled down to each temperature point. As shown in Fig. S6, the XRD patterns reveal that the material at 900 � C matches well with the standard patterns of P2 ’ phase, attributed to the low average valence of Mn ions thus leading to an orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase as commented before [ 29 ]. As the temperature decreases, the characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with “ y “ ) of P2 ’ phase are reduced in intensity and they are consecutively shifted to slightly higher diffraction angles due to the contraction of ab plane. The fact corresponds the disappearance of the orthorhombic distortion and the increasing of Mn ions average valence. As the temperature is cooled down to 800 � C and beneath, only P2 phase is observed and its diffraction signals fit perfectly the standard patterns of P2 phase, probably due to the fact that the crystal lattice tends to uptake oxygen in the cooling process [ 29 ]. The XRD data obtained at variable temperature fully reveal that the structure of the material subjected at different the cooling process [ 29 ]. The XRD data obtained at variable temperature fully reveal that the structure of the material subjected at different temperature during cooling process could be obtained by appropriately controlling the cooling rate, and the faster cooling treatment promote maintaining the structure of high-temperature (900 � C). 3.2. Electrochemical performance of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 cathode materials The electrochemical performance of the NAFMO-NC/QU/LN Fig. 3. (a - b) 23 Na NMR T 2 fitting results and (c - d) direct-current polarization fitting results of prepared materials. The spin-spin relaxation time (T 2 ) was measured by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence as a function of echo time, fitting by the formula of M xy 1⁄4 M xyo � (e -t/T2 ). Electronic conductivity is calculated by i ∞ and Ohm ’ s law. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 6 materials was evaluated in Na half cells at 30 � C. The galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of the electrodes within the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at 12 mA g   1 (0.05C) current rate are shown in Fig. 4 a. As the cooling rate for the prepared materials increases, the following charac teristics of first cycle curves deserve special attention: (i) These three samples exhibit smooth charge-discharge profiles, confirming multiple phase transition and Na þ -vacancy ordering during (de)intercalation processes have been suppressed by the introduction of Al and Fe ele ments. While the plateaus at ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V become more obvious with increase of cooling rate, which are related to phase transition processes and will be discussed in the next section. (ii) The open circuit voltages ( Fig. S7 ) of the electrodes decrease continuously with the increasing of cooling rate, corresponding to the decrease of Mn ions average valence. (iii) The initial discharge capacities are 131, 175 and 202 mAh g   1 for NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN, respec tively. They are significantly improved with the accelerating cooling rate. To the best our knowledge, NAFMO-LN material has shown the highest initial discharge capacity and specific energy density (~527 Wh kg   1, solely considering the mass of cathode active material) among reported P2-type sodium oxides materials in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V. Furthermore, as the working window is expanded to 1.5–4.5 V ( Fig. S8 ), the capacities delivered by NAFMO-NC, NAFMO-QU and NAFMO-LN are 210, 224 and 246 mA g   1, respectively, while an obvious plateau attributing to anionic redox reaction appears at ~4.2 V [ 17, 43, 44 ]. As indicated above, the anionic charge compensation pro cess usually shows the poor cyclabilities and slow dynamics in both sodium cathode materials and Li-analogues, so we mainly focus on the working potential below 4 V. In order to meet the needs of the market of smart grids, the requirement for the discharge rates of NIBs is much higher. The rate capabilities were tested by charging at low current and discharging at various currents, the same as previous researches [ 33, 35, 39 ], and the results are shown in Fig. 4 b - c. NAFMO-LN electrode shows the highest capacities and stable cyclabilities at each current density, providing the capacities of 202, 191, 173, 161 and 148 mAh g   1 as the discharge current densities are increased from 12, 24, 120, 240–480 mA g   1, respectively. Even with the 100 times increase of the current den sity (1200 mA g   1 ), the capacity retention is up to 60% (122 mAh g   1 ), indicating excellent rate capability among the reported high-rate P2-type electrodes. The diffusion coefficients of Na þ were calculated from GITT results to evaluate the (de)intercalation of kinetics of Na þ during first cycle. As shown in Fig. S9, the geomean D Na þ of NAFMO-LN (2.474 � 10   10 cm² s   1 ) is slight higher than NAFMO-QU (2.196 � 10   10 cm² s   1 ) and is much higher than that of NAFMO-NC (5.107 � 10   11 cm² s   1 ), which is consistent with the best rate performance of liquid N 2 treatment sample. In addition, the cycle stabilities of the ma terials are also investigated at different current densities of 12 and 1200 mA g   1 as shown in Fig. S10 and 4d, respectively. At the current density of 12 mA g   1, NAFMO-LN electrode delivers the highest initial discharge capacity of 202 mAh g   1 and the highest maintained capacity of 198 mAh g   1 after ten cycles without any electrode modifications. Espe cially, the excellent reversibility and negligible voltage change are found in the charge-discharge curves of NAFMO-LN electrodes. Due to the excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current rate of 1200 mA g   1 excellent rate performance of NAFMO-LN, this electrode was subjected to further galvanostatic charged-discharged cycles at such a high current rate of 1200 mA g   1. As shown in Fig. 4 d and S11, it also maintains the initial capacity of 122 mAh g   1 and the long cycling stability is achieved with the remarkable capacity retentions of 98% after 100 cycles, 95% after 200 cycles and 81% after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g   1 with ~100% coulombic efficiency during cycling. The plateaus of ~2.2 V and ~3.5 V are substantial reduction from the comparison dQ/dV curves at low (12 mA g   1 ) and high (1200 mA g   1 ) current densities, especially the plateau at low voltage which is deemed as the main reason for the ca pacity decays due to the notorious Mn 3 þ Jahn-Teller effects. Ex-situ 23 Na NMR was further performed to explore the structure evolutions at high current density. As shown in Fig. S12, the P2 phase signal is maintained during the whole charge process, and thus the electrode could exhibit Fig. 4.

The best rate performance and outstanding overall electro chemical properties of NAFMO-LN electrode demonstrate a potential competitive advantage to the general P2 cathodes. Fig. 5.

Long-range and local structural transformations during (De) Sodiation processes In-situ synchrotron XRD was employed to track the long-range structural transformations of NAFMO-LN electrode induced by the (de)intercalation of Na þ at a rate current of 24 mA g   1. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the XRD patterns have been divided into four stages to clarify the structure evolution process more clearly. The (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks are retained during the whole process, corresponding to a quasi-solid-solution reaction rather than typically multiple-phases transition reaction according to the previous reports [ 45,46 ]. As indi cated above, the prepared electrode is assigned to a P2 0 I phase, which exhibits a slight orthorhombic distortion from P2 phase. At the begin ning of charge process, the (020) peak reduces in intensity and shifts to higher angle, corresponding to the decrease of distortion degree, and a P2 phase is formed at x 1⁄4 0.40. Afterwards, a board peak is observed at the higher diffraction angle of 9 � at the end of charge process, owing to the formation of small amount of O-type stacking in the P2 structure. As reported by Bruce ’ s group, this process should be indicated as a “ Z ” phase evolved by the intergrowth mechanism, which have been mentioned in many P2 compounds, especially those containing Fe 3 þ [ 35, 47, 48 ]. The formation of “ Z ” phase is more moderate than O2 phase at high voltage, as the lattice parameter changes are smaller in magni tude and less abrupt, leading to a stable structure and better capacity retention [ 49 ]. The structural evolution is highly reversible during discharge. Of note, the (002), (110), (112), (113) and (114) peaks of P2 phase maintain in the rest of the discharge process, rather than replaced by that of typical P2 ’ phase with high degree of orthorhombic distortion (denoted as P2 ’ II). As the x equals 0.79, the characteristic signals of P2 ’ II phase are presented in both in-situ XRD and ss-NMR ( Fig. 5 b) results. However, such a moderate phase transition also makes it hard to distinguish between the P2 ’ I and P2 ’ II phase from in-situ XRD results. As shown in Fig. 5 b, the local environment information of the elec trode materials can be observed through 23 Na MAS NMR spectra, since Na þ directly participates in the electrochemical reaction in NIBs. 23 Na 1D slices were extracted from²D projection-MATPASS (pj-MATPASS) NMR spectra to eliminate the sideband signals [ 50 ]. Consistent with the powder sample, the ss-NMR spectrum of NAFMO-LN pristine electrode also shows the resonance signals at ~1250 ppm and ~0 ppm, rather than monoclinic and hydrated phases that usually occur during elec trode prepared process, suggesting that P2 ’ I phase is stable and structural transitions do not occur during electrode preparing procedure [ 34, 51 ]. During initial charge and discharge processes, the chemical shift of the signal moves to the high and low value gradually, corre spongding to the increase and decrease of the Mn ions average valence, respectively. The local structural evolution is in good agreement with the results of in situ XRD. When the x 1⁄4 0.32, the amount of local environment significantly increases because of the glide of MnO 2 layers, a wide peak at ~1100 ppm emerges, corresponding to the “ Z ” phase. Besides, the P2 phase signal can also be observed at the high voltage and decrease in intensity with “ Z ” phase emerging, which further proves the formation of “ Z ” phase is an intermediate and moderate process evolving intergrowth of P2 and O2 phases. The local structure is also highly reversible in discharge process. In x 1⁄4 0.78, the characteristic signal of P2 ’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distin guished from the signal of P2 ’ I phase. Besides, the P2 ’ II phase signal signal of P2 ’ II phase appears at ~850 ppm, which are clearly distin guished from the signal of P2 ’ I phase. Besides, the P2 ’ II phase signal of NAFMO-LN sample is much broader than that of non-doped P2 0 -Na 0.67 MnO 2 materials while similar to the stable P2 - Na 0.67 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 and P2 - Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 materials in previ ous works [ 34, 39 ], corresponding to a much more moderate structure transition and thus better cycle performance. 3.4. Effects of various doping elements on structural and electrochemical properties of materials In order to give some illustration on the significance of the work, the Mn ions average valence of layered oxide materias have been adjusted by introducting different valence doping element, e.g. the introduction of Li þ is expected to rise 3 folds molar equivalents of Mn 3 þ to Mn 4 þ, and 2 folds for Mg 2 þ and equal amount for Al 3 þ. Therefore, Na 0.67 M 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 (M 1⁄4 Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ ) and non-doped materials were also prepared via the same synthesis process to further reveal the rela tionship between the Mn oxidation state, structure and electrochemical properties. The longand short-range structural information are showed in Fig. 6. The obvious orthorhombic distortion of P2 phase can been found in non-doped NMO-QU/-LN and Al 3 þ -doped NAMO-LN samples with exhibiting the characteristic signals of P2 ’ phase in both XRD patterns and ss-NMR spectra. Also, orthorhombic distortion is observed for Mg 2 þ -doped NMMO-LN sample, just like the above results of NAFMO-LN sample. While the Li þ -doped NLMO samples do not show any distortion in both longand short-structure by each cooling treat ment. Besides, the full width at half maximum of P2 phase also become narrow continuously with the faster cooling treatment for each prepared material. The above results indicate that the orthorhombic distortion tends to exist in the materials with low theoretical manganese valence and TM vacancies can be suppressed for P2 type Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 by the faster cooling treatment, and then exhibiting a more uniform local environment. A comparison of the electrochemical performance of non-doped and doped Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials (Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ ) prepared by NC, QU and LN methods is shown in Fig. 6 a - e. The initial charge and discharge capacities of all prepared materials increase significantly with the accelerating cooling rate, and the maximum capacity is obtained by liquid N 2 quenching (LN) treatment for all samples, demonstrating that the rapid cooling treatment can eliminate Mn vacancies, increase redox centers, and effectively improve the capacity of P2 type Na 0.67 M x Mn 1x O 2. Moreover, Fig. 7 f and S13 show that the cycle stablity of Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials is highly related to the Mn ions average valence in the materials except for NAFMO-LN sample, which exhibits optimal electrochemical performance through the synergy effect of Al and Fe co-doping [ 32, 33 ]. The lower Mn ions average valence causes more severe orthorhombic distortion in Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 and thus being detrimental to cyclability, e.g. the highest specific capacity (215 mAh g   1, 2–4 V) but lowest capacity retention of non-doped NMO-LN (Mn þ 3.33, δ 1⁄4 5.59%) sample, exhibiting many small plateau in galva nostatic charge-discharge curves. In contrast, the doped samples exhibit much smoother charge-discharge profiles, which evidences that the introduction of non-electrochemically active element disrupt the TM ordering in the TM layers and hamper Na þ -vacancy ordering during cycling [ 13 ]. The 10 mol% of Li-doping material presents a pure P2 phase without any lattice distortion and a stable cycling performance. However, even with liquid N 2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mn þ 3.59, δ 1⁄4 0%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g   1. There However, even with liquid N 2 quenched treatment, NLMO-LN (Mn þ 3.59, δ 1⁄4 0%) sample only delivers specific capacity of 130 mAh g   1. There fore, a rational element substitution should be implemented to mitigate Jahn-Teller effect and make a balance bewteen the capacity and cycle stablity to achieve superior electrochemical performance. Thus, the optimal co-doped NAFMO-LN material, with moderate initial Mn ions valence (Mn þ 3.39 ) and slight distortion ( δ 1⁄4 2.91%), shows not only an outstanding capacity of 202 mAh g   1 at voltage range of 2–4 V, but also a satifactory cyclability of 90.4% after 30 cycles at 12 mA g   1. 4. Conclusion In summary, our comparative results obtained in Na cells of nondoped and doped Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials with Li þ, Mg 2 þ, Al 3 þ and Fe 3 þ prepared via different cooling processes is verified by using the combination of in-situ synchrotron XRD, TOF PND and ss-NMR mea surements. They reveal that a simple liquid N 2 quenching treatment X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 9 Fig. 6.

Na 0.67 Li 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2, Na 0.67 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2, Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 2 and Na 0.67 MnO 2 are denoted as NLMO, NMMO, NAMO and NMO, respectively. The spinning sideband signal and the characteristic signal of orthorhombic distortion are marked with “ * “ and ” z “, respectively. X. Liu et al. Nano Energy 76 (2020) 104997 10 could be regarded as a genaral synergetic strategy to control the for mation of vacancy in TM layers and thus to enhance Mn 4 þ /Mn 3 þ redox center. Consequently, the deliverable capacity of all the Mn-based Na 0.67 M x Mn 1-x O 2 materials can be signifcantly improved below 4.0 V, eliminating the factors responsible of capacity dacay such as electrolyte decomposition, structural collapse and oxygen loss at high voltgate. The ss-NMR, GITT and direct-current polarization results demonstrate the highest Na þ mobility and electronic conductivity for the liquid N 2 quenching sample, among the three different cooling rate samples. Moreover, we introduced Al and Fe, the top two earth abundance metal elements into TM layers to form the cost-effective Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 compound. After liquid N 2 quenching, the slightly dis torted Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.85 O 2 delivers a remarkable capacity of 202 and 246 mAh g   1 within 2.0–4.0 V and 1.5–4.5 V, respectively. Even with 100 times higher current density (1200 mA g   1 ), the specific capacity remains up to 122 mAh g   1 over 600 cycles with 81% capacity retention, indicating exceptional rate and power capabilities with excellent cycling stability. The outstanding overall performance of Na 0.67 Al 0.1 Fe 0.05 Mn 0.2 material demonstrated the synergetic strategy of liquid N 2 quenching treatment and rational element substitution, which can be used as a general guide for the further development of high ca pacity, high power and stable cycling materials, especially for Mn-based layered electrodes in NIBs.

Introduction For the sake of realizing the sustainable development of human society, the employment of clean energy instead of fossil fuel has become the req uire ment of contempor ary society. In the w ake of the rapidl y gro wing demand for large-scale energy stor age syst ems, electric vehicles, smart grids, and recharg eable batt eries with high energy and po wer density are the most sensible choice for v arious energy stor age technologies [1–3]. Electrochemical energy stor age repr esented by lithium-ion batteries has become the main energy stor age method now. How ever, lithium reserv es are not abundant, and the increasing cost re strict its e xte nsiv e and large-scale appli cation. By contrast, sodium is currentl y the fourth-largest element in the earth’s crust, and it is cheap. Therefor e, sodium ion batt eries are e xpect ed to re place lithium ion batt eries in some specific energy stor age market s, which can alleviate the shortage of lithium re sources to a certain e xtent [4,5]. Both Li and Na are alkali metals, the ionic radi us of Na + is larger than Li + (1 .02 vs 0.7 6) [6–8]. R ecentl y, P2-type materials ha ve attract ed considerable inter est because of their e x cellent cy cling stability and rat e capacity [9, 1 0]. The lay ered P2 phase structure Na x MO 2 with high specific capacity has re ceiv ed widespread atten tion due to its attr activ e price combined with envir onmental friendliness [1 1]. How ever, the e xpected electrochemical perfor mance for P2-Na x MO 2 is often unsatisfactory. This is mainly due to the serious Jahn-T eller effect re lated to the Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ redo x couple, causing the P2-P2' phase tran sition [1 2] ther eby affecting Na + MO 2 is often unsatisfactory. This is mainly due to the serious Jahn-T eller effect re lated to the Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ redo x couple, causing the P2-P2' phase tran sition [1 2] ther eby affecting Na + tran sport kinetics [1 3]. A prime symbol ( ′ ) is used to indicate inplane distortion of the he xagonal lattice in the crystal structure, such as for P2-type [1 4]. The distortion reduces the Na + mobility and further leads to structural collapse during repeat ed cy cles. Therefor e, further processing and optimization of structur al stability are of great concern. Element doping is gener ally considered to be an ef fectiv e measure to re duce the deformation of transition metal lay er spacing and thus impro ve the re versibility of the structure. Where fore, understanding the effect of different doping elements is key to further develop and optimize Na x MO 2 cathodes for NIBs. For in stance, Ni is used to pro viding high voltag e to elev ate the a ver age discharge voltag e [1 4–1 7]. Fe doping suppresses minor structur al tran sitions during cy cling and Fe 3+ /Fe 4+ redo x couple pr ovides higher wor king pot ential [1 8].

How ever, Co is an inter esting alternati ve, which can be inv olv ed in redo x re actions in parallel with Mn during the cy cle. W ang et al. [22] ha ve successfull y synthesized P2 - Na 2/3 Mn y Co 1-y O 2 by con ventional solid state reaction. How ever, diffusion of Na + has not been adeq uatel y studied. Although P2-Na 0.67 Co 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 pr epared by Zhu et al. [23] has e x cellent cy cle performance, NCM55 doped by 50 % Co doping is challenging for commercial applications owing to the e xpensiv e price of Co. Nicolas et al. [24] concentra te on impro ving the electrode performance of materia ls by re gulating the mor phology. It w as pointe d out that the electrochemistry performance of the flake structur e materia l doped w as not outstanding. K onaro v et al. [25] mainly conducted w ork on the P2-P2' phase transition. But we pro ve that Co has an adv antage ous inhibitory effect on the P2-P2' phase tran sition besides the impro vement of Na + diffusion used by lattice paramet er changes and DFT. It is w orth mentioning that, the flake structure with an ob vious and uniform size prepar ed by the h ydro thermal method can promo te the diffusion of Na + and accel erat e the reaction rat e. As far as w e know, the influence of Co on Na 0.67 MnO 2 is considered for the first time comprehensi vel y and profoundl y from the aspects of morphology, crystal structure, and electronic structur e. In addition, although Co has a prominent effect on the impro vement of electrochemical performance, the price of Co is relati vel y high. Using of less stoich iometric ratio is also a promi nent factor that must be taken into consideration. Here, Na 0.67 Mn 1-x Co x O 2 (x = 0,0. 1 ,0.2) prepar ed by h ydr othermal method ha ve been studied as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The Co 3+ and Mn 4+ wer e stable and random ly distributed in the trans ition metal lay er. Most importantly, the incorporation of Co can effectiv ely low er the Mn 3+ with the JahnT eller effect and lessen the irrev ersible distortion of P2-P2 ́ materia l. Furt hermore, the particles of NCM2 prepar ed by the h ydro thermal method ha ve high purity, and uniform particle size, which wer e conduciv e to the diffusion of Na + and accelerat e the reaction rat e. In this paper, we comprehend the positiv e role of Co doping in the Na 0.67 MnO 2 cathode using a series of electrochemical analy sis methods. 2. Experiment section All chemicals used are re ceiv ed from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. The precursor w as synthesized by using am monium bicarbonate (NH 4 HCO 3 ) as a precipitant assisted thr ough the h ydro thermal method. First, a certain stoichiometric solution of cobalt acetate and manganese acetate with a ratio of 1/1 0:9/1 0 w as added into 30 mL deionized w ater and stirred to form a uniform solution, then a certain amount of NH 4 HCO 3 w as added into the abov e solution for uniform stirring. The resulting solution w as put into the react or. Set the temper atur e of the chemical re action. After natural cooling, the h ydro thermal reaction product w as filte red and then w ashed three times. Vacuum drying at 80 °C for 24 h, the precursor w as obtained and calcined at 50 0 °C for 6 h. After natural cooling, the prec ursor and e x cess 5 %mol of anh ydr ous sodium car bonate w ere fully ground in an agate mortar and calcined at 90 0 °C for 1 0 h, Na 0.67 Co 0. 1 Mn 0.9 O 2 (N CM1) w as obtained, and Na 0.67 Co 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 2 (NCM2) and Na 0.67 MnO 2 (NM) wer e prepar ed with the same method described abov e. The prepar ation diagram is shown in Fig. 1. 2. 1.

The scanning rang e w as set at 1 0°~ 80° and the scanning rat e w as 2°min -1. The surface morphology of the materia ls w as charact erized by an S480 0 scanning electron microsc ope (SEM JSM-7 6 1 0 F) made by Hitachi Compan y, Japan, and the distribution of elements w as analyzed by energy spectrum analy sis (EDS). 2.2.

Sodium metal w as applied to the counter electrode, where as har d carbon w as used as anode for the full cell. 1 M NaPF 6 in an EC/DEC (1:1 v/v) w as used as electrol yte. A glass fiber (GF/D) w as served as a separat or. The mass loading of activ e materia l w as around 1 .2 mg/cm². The CR2032 cell w as assembled in an Ar -filled glov e bo x.

The surface chemistry element composition w as dete rmined by X -ra y phot oelectron spectroscop y (XPS) (PHI QU AN TERA-II SXM). 3. R esults and discussion Examination of the XRD patterns demonstrat es that single-phase materia ls wer e obtained for all the studied compositions. This w as confirmed by Rietve ld re finement using the Full prof suite Progr am ( Fig. 2 a-c). The materia ls show ed a P2-type structure, crystallized in the P63/mmc space gr oup. The diffraction peaks of all the samples are consistent with the standard card PDF2 7–05 7 1 [26]. Furthermor e, no impurity peak is observed, which indicates that Co is well in corporat ed into the crystal lattice. The unit cell paramet ers a of Co doped materials are decreased with the augment of Co content but enlarges d spacing ( T able S1 ). The Na-O bond of the Co-doped ma teri al increases but the TM-O and O-O bonds are shortened, which makes the insertion and de-insertion of Na + diffusion easier. The shorte ning of the TM-O bond and O-O bond is beneficial to the structur al stability of P2-type materials [2 7]. Fig. 2 d show s the shift of the base peak to w ards left as the cobalt content impro vement, re vealing the shrinkage of the TMO 2. There is the lattice structure of lay ered P2 - Na 2/3 Mn 1-x Co x O 2 (x = 0,0. 1 ,0.2) ( Fig. 2 d). The two tran sition metals ( Co/Mn ) are randoml y distribut ed in the MO2 lay er on account of the condition that Co 3+ (0.545 Å), Co 4+ (0.53 Å), and Mn 4+ (0.53 Å) ha ve similar ion radii [28,29]. It can be seen from ( T able S2–4) that Co is smoothl y doped in the transition metal lay er. In P2 type structure, sodium ions at the prism site are supposed to pass thr ough the cente r of a relati vel y wide plane q uadrilate ral con tributing P2 diffusion barrier that is relati vel y low, which can show e x cellent electroc hemical performance [30,3 1]. As shown in Fig. 3 a-b, the XRD test w as performed on the NM and NCM2 after the 1 0th, 50th, and 1 0 0th cy cles. It w as found that NCM2 still maintains the original P2 structure after 20 % Co doping, but the pure material NM show ed (022) char acteristic peak of P2'. The same re sult has also been confirmed in the resear ch of o ther Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the preparat ion process of Na 0.67 Co 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 2. C. cheng Fu, J. W ang, Y. Li et al.

(a) XRD test of NM after 1 0th, 50th, 1 0 0th cyc le; (b) XRD test of NCM2 after 1 0th, 50th, 1 0 0th cy cle. C. cheng Fu, J. W ang, Y. Li et al. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 9 1 8 (2022) 1 65569 3 scholars, for e xample K umakura [32] and W ang [33]. Therefor e, Co can effectiv ely inhibit the occurrence of P2-P2' phase tran sition, which is conduciv e to structural stability pro viding fa vor able con ditions for fast insertion and e xsertion of Na +. For the sake of comprehending the morphology and structural charact eristics of materials, a series of tests w ere performed to charact erize the material. It can be seen from Fig. 4 a-f that the particles of the thr ee materials are all poly gonal plate-like struc tures, with a particle size of about 1–2 μm, and the thickness of the sheet is within a few nanomete rs. The results are consistent with the XRD test analy sis. The surface of the NM ( Fig. 4 a, d) materia l is not smooth, and the agglomer ation is relati vel y ob vious. In contrast, the surfaces of NCM1 and NCM2 are smoothe r and less agglomerat ed, which are beneficial to augmenting the specific surface area. It is conduciv e to the activ e materia l fully contact with the electrol yte, further accelerating the charge-di scharge re action rat e [34]. In contrast, the particle size of NCM2 is uniform along with the lay er ed structure is more clearl y visible, the surface is smoothe r. The flake materials gather tog ether to form some micropor es, which is in fa vor of the full penetration of the electrol yte. In addition, a single uniform form can re duce the po wdering of the electrode during the charging and discharging proce ss, which makes for the stability of the structure. T o analyze the element distribution in the NCM2 material, a plane scan of the elements w as performed on the NCM2. Fig. 4 g-k are the corresponding distribution diagrams of O, Na Mn, and Co respecti vel y. It can be seen that the distribution of each element is uniform. It can be seen from Fig. 5 a NCM2 presents a flaky structur e, which is consistent with the results of the SEM image. In addition, w e can find that NCM2 is a lay ered structure formed by stacking sheet-like structures. This re sult is consistent with the results ob tained by XRD. Fig. 5 c is a high-resol ution tran smission electron microsc ope (HRTEM) picture. W e calculated the interplanar spacing to be 2.48 Å. Accor ding to the PDF standar d card in XRD (#2 7–075 1), w e know that the correspondin g crystal plane is (1 0 0) plane. By analyzing the structure of the P2 type NCM2 electrode materia l, it is know n that sodium ions diffuse along the two-di mensional plane perpendicular to the (0 02) plane during the charge and discharge proce ss, and the dir ection perpendicular to the (0 02) plane is the (1 0 0) plane, that is, sodium Ions diffuse along the (1 0 0) plane. Fig. 5 d is the electron diffr action pattern performed in the selecte d area of Fig. 4 c. Analy sis of the diffr action spots show s that NCM2 is a he x agon al materia l. In order to further e xplore the composition of element v alence states, the material w as char acterized by XPS measurement. Fig. 6 a show s the measured spectra of the three cathode materials. The peaks of P 2p, Mn 2p, Co 2p, Na 1s, and O 1s can be clearl y detect ed, and there is no binding energy peak of other elements. The Mn 2p spectrum show s four peaks in Figs. 6 b-d, 6 4 1 .4 1 eV and 653.50 eV are Mn 3+, and the o ther two peaks are Mn 4+ at 6 43.0 eV and 654.5 eV [35]. Co 2p also e xhibits four peaks, two of which are located at 780.22 eV and 795.20 eV are Co 3+, and the other two peaks at 782.33 eV and 79 7. 1 0 eV are Co 4+. F rom Fig. 6 e-f, it can be seen that the Mn 3+ in NCM2 is significantly reduced. This is due to the Fig. 4. SEM images show the micromorphology of NM(a,d), NCM1(b ,e), and NCM2(c -f).

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 9 1 8 (2022) 1 65569 4 appropriat e stoich iometricCo -doping inhibits the JahnT eller effect and the occurrence of phase tran sitions. But the Co content of NCM1is not enough to achiev e the desired effect. Aiming to study the electrochemical properties of Co ion doping, charge and discharge tests wer e carried out in these cathode materia ls. Fig. 7 a NM show s an ob vious voltag e plateau around 2.0 V. The appearance of the volt age plateau is accompanied by the oc curr ence of phase distortion [36]. The charge-discharg e curve of materia ls Co doped becomes smoother and the voltag e plateau at about 2.0 V disappears during discharge, indicating that Co doping is Fig. 5.

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 9 1 8 (2022) 1 65569 5 beneficial to stabilizing the structure and suppressin g the P2-P2' phase transition. In addition, the polarization degree during the cy cle is re lativ ely few, re vealing the re versibility of the materia l is also elev ated [36,3 7]. Fig. 7 d-f re flect the dQ/dV curve of thr ee ma terials, NM presents a zigzag-shaped comple x peak due to the orde r of v acancies [38]. How ever, after Co doping, the curves of NCM1 and NCM2 become smoother ( Fig. 7 e-f). The redo x peaks abov e 3.0 V is caused by the o xidation of Co 3+ to Co 4+ follow ed by two sets of re duction peaks around 4.0 V and 2.0 V corresponds to Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ [39,40]. How ever, With the incorporation of Co, a new peak appears near 2.5 V, which may be deriv ed from Co 3+ /Co 2+ [4 1]. The cy cle performance of the three materia ls at 0.2 C can be seen in Fig. 8 a that the performance is relat ed to the content of Co doping. After 1 0 0 cy cles of discharge, NCM2, NCM1, and NM remain capacity are 1 53mAh·g -1, 1 1 9mAh·g -1, and 1 02mAh·g -1 respecti vel y. Com pared with NM, the cy cle performance of NCM1 is impro ved, but the gener ous effect is not achieved. It may be due to insufficient Co doping content. In contrast, the cy cle performance of NCM2 is sig nificantly impro ved. This is largel y because of that when the Co doping content is relati vel y enough. Low -state Co ions are doped at the Mn site, which can increase the ratio of Mn 4+ and reduce the Mn 3+ with JahnT eller activity [42]. Fig. 8 b-c is the charge and dis charge curve of NM and NCM2 at 0.2 C rat e. It can be seen that NFM has a significant voltag e drop at about 1 .75 V relat ed to the Mn 3+ JahnT eller effect with the increase of the number of cy cles, which has a serious impact on the stability of the lattice structur e of the material. After 1 0 0 cy cles, the coulombic efficiency w as 99. 8 %, 99. 3 %, and 98 %, respecti vel y. Co doping impro ves the coulombic efficiency, which is beneficial to the stability of the structure and makes the insertion and deinter calation of sodium ions smoothl y [43]. In terms of electroc hemistry and structural rev ersibility, the high-rat e charge-discharg e cy cle performance in the voltag e rang e of 1 .5–4.0 V has been further studied. Fig. 8 d is a graph of the cy cle performance after 20 0 cy cles at a current density of 2 C. The initial discharge capacity at 2 C rat e is 82 mAh·g -1, 98 mAh·g -1, 1 06 mAh·g -1 re spectiv ely. W e found that with the increase of current density, the discharge specific capacity of NCM2 is low er than the discharge capacity of 0.2 C. How ever, the cy cle stability of NCM2 after 1 0 0 cy cles is more prom inent, and the capacity ret ention rat e is 88. 7 %. Fig. 8 e are the charge and discharge curve of NCM2 when the curr ent density is 2 C. The voltag e fade is significantly suppressed for 20 % Co doping in the consecutiv e cy cles. At the end of the discharge, the incorporation of low -priced and high-spin Co 2+ makes the a ver age combined state of Mn slightl y higher than the level of 3 +, which can w ell inhibit the JahnT eller effect and benefit the stability of the structur e [4 1 ,4 4]. Fig. 8 f is the rat e performance gr aph of the thr ee materia ls. NCM2 still has a capacity of 1 3 7. 5mAh·g -1 when the rat e is re stor ed to 0.2 C. NCM2 has e x cellent rat e performance and higher re versibility. The influence of different Co content on the electrode charge tran sfer kinetics is studied by the A C impedance test (EIS). In Fig. 8 g, the diagram is composed of two semicircles, including diagonal lines in the high-freq uency re gion and the lo w-fr eq uency region. The high-freq uency region of the real axis inter cept repr esents the im pedance of ohmic resistance and the solution re sistance, called R s. The mid-freq uency semicir cle repr esents the charge transfer im pedance, called R ct pedance of ohmic resistance and the solution re sistance, called R s. The mid-freq uency semicir cle repr esents the charge transfer im pedance, called R ct, which is caused by the interface betwee n the electrol yte and the electrode. The low -freq uency obliq ue line re presen ts the impedance of sodium ion diffusion in the electrode, which is called W arburg impedance. The linear part of EIS in the lo w-fr eq uency re gion is relat ed to the Na + diffusion coefficient, and its calculation formula is as follow s: = R T A n F C D 2 2 2 2 4 4 2 2 (1) R is the ideal gas constant, R= 8.3 1 4 J·mol -1 ·K -1 ; T is the absolute temp eratur e, also called K elvin temper ature, if test ed at room tem perat ure, T = 298. 1 5 K; A is the electron transfer re action in each molecule. The number of electrons, the size is 1; F is the F arada y constant, F= 9650 0 C/mol. C is the concentration of sodium ions in Fig. 7.

Accor ding to T able 1, all the v alues of NCM2 are significantly smaller than the o ther two, and the R f v alue is small, indicating that the opt imal co-doping can inhibit the decomposition of the elec trol yte and reduce the dissolution of Mn 2+ in the electrol yte [45]. Compared with the other two materia ls, the resistance of charge transfer resistance (R ct ) has an absolute adv antage, indicating that the electrochemical re action kinetics of NCM2 has been impro ved. A ccording to the abov e calculation formula, the Na + diffusion coef ficients of NM, NCM2 and NCM1 samples are 3.43 × 1 0–1 3 cm² ·s -1, 7 .53 × 1 0–1 0 cm² ·s -1, 1 .78 × 1 0–1 2 cm² ·s -1 re spectiv ely. This re sult show s that the approp riate amount of doped NCM2 material is more conduciv e to the diffusion of Na +, this is because the crystal structure is stable after Co doping, and the phase chang e is not easy to occur in the long cy cle process so that Na + can be inserted and e xtract ed q uick ly. In order to further verify the accuracy of the diffusion coefficient, the GITT test w as performed on NM and NCM2 materials, as shown in Fig. 9 a-b, the NM electrode D Na + is maintained betwee n 1 0–1 2–1 0–1 3 cm² ·s -1. The NCM2 electrode material D Na + is maintained between 1 0–9 -1 0–1 0 cm² ·s -1, which is consistent with the previous test re sults, which pro ves once again that Co doping effectiv ely impro ves the interfac ial transport performance of sodium ions. The following T able 1 lists the re sistance v alues obtained from the EIS curve. Compared with NM, the R f v alue of NCM2 is smaller, in dicating that the op timal Co doping can inhibit the decomposition of the electrol yte and red uce the dissolution of Mn 2+ in the electrol yte.

Journal of Alloys and Compounds 9 1 8 (2022) 1 65569 7 The resistance of NCM2 charge transfer re sistance (Rct) has an ab solute adv antage, suggesting that the electroche mical re action ki netics of NCM2 has been impro ved [46]. Har d carbon is considered to be the most pr omising electrode material for sodium-ion batteries on account of its high sodium stor age capacity and low sodium stor age pot ential. As shown in Fig. 1 0 a, in order to verify the practicability of the NCM2 electrode material for full cell, NCM2 w as used as the cathode material, and hard carbon w as used as the anode material in a mass ratio of 1:1 .2 to match the full cell (NNC M//HC). The voltag e rang e for the full cell is 1 .4–3.9 V. NCM2/ /HC still has a capacity of 1 03 mAh g -1 re maining, and the energy density based on the cathode mass energy can reach 254 Wh ·kg -1 at 0.5 C after 20 0 cy cles. The performance of NCM2/ /HC is outstanding, which is comparable to that of the matched by Zhao et al. [4 7]. The capacities at 1 0th, 50th, 1 0 0th, 1 50th, and 20 0th cy cles are 1 4 7 mAh g -1, 1 36 mAh g -1, 1 24 mAh g -1, 1 1 5 mAh g -1, and 1 03 mAh g -1 respecti vel y. As can be seen in Fig. 1 0 c, after NCM2//HC w as test ed at differen t rat es of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, and 1 0 C, the materia l still had a rev ersible specific capacity of 1 3 7 mAh g -1 when it returned to 0.2 C, NCM2//HC presents highly superior rat e per formance. In orde r to pr obe into the effect of Co doping on the density of states of NM, First-principles calculation w as performed. As shown in Fig. S1, NM and NCM2 straddle both sides of the Fe rmi leve l, in dicating that materials ha ve been eq uipped with fa vor able metallic properties. The ob vious band gap can be observed in NM, but the band gap is almost non-e xistent after Co doping, indicating that the electronic conductivity of the material is enhanced after Co doping [48]. More impressi vel y, the DOS of the O 2p orbital aggra ndizes near the Fe rmi leve l and the re do x reaction of o xy gen is promo ted Fig. 9.

C. cheng Fu, J. W ang, Y. Li et al. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 9 1 8 (2022) 1 65569 8 with the incorporation of Co, pro viding charge compensation for the corresponding higher voltag e region [49]. In addition, manganese ions in NM e xist in a mix ed configuration of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+, but Mn 3+ occupies the ma jority. While the proportion of Mn 4+ (t 2 g 3 -eg 0 ) increased after Co doping. It is well known that un paired electron s Mn 3+ has strong JahnT eller activ ity, which can lead to lattice structure distortion and charge orde ring, thus limiting the inter calation and deinter calation of Na +. Therefor e, we conclude that the distortion of the JahnT eller effect for Mn 3+ can be effectiv el y wea kened by Co doping. A ccording to the theoret ical specific capacity formula ( =Q nF M ), NCM2 corr esponds to 0.58 sodium re lease when charged to 4.0 V. In order to more fully comprehen d the electron beha vior during char ging and discharging, the PDOS are plot ted in Fig. 1 1 a-l. When Na is emigrat ed (Na 0.5 ), the spin orbits of Mn and Co on eg graduall y mov e from the left to the right side of the Fe rmi level. The shif t indicates that Mn 3+ (t 2g 3 -eg1) is o xidized to Mn 4+ (t 2 g 3 -eg 0 ) combined with Co 2+ is o xidized to Co 3+, and the charge compensation is pr ovided by Co and Mn tog ether in this process. When charging to Na 0.34, the charge compensation of Mn ha ve accomplished, and Co continues to play the compensation role until the end of charging. The electronic structur e w as further inv estigated and found that the strong cov a lency between Co t 2 g and O 2p forms an electron -deficient state or "hole" in the O 2p orbital, which is beneficial to inhibit the loss of o xy gen, ther eby impro ving the structural stability [50]. T o further clarify the reason for the e x cellent rat e performance of NCM2. Na + diffusion of materials w as inv estigated by First principles calcula tions using the NEB method. The correspondin g Na + migration bar riers of NM and NCM2 are shown in Fig. 1 1 m and Fig. 1 1 n show s the Na + diffusion paths. Theoretical calculations show ed that the e x cessi ve migrat ion barrier of Na + in NM is about 1 .2 1 eV, which is much higher than that of NCM2 (0.58 eV). The results make clear that the Co-doping modification can pr omot e the diffusion of Na + and pro vide facile ion diffusion channels [5 1]. 4. Conclusions In summary, lay ered Na 0.67 Co 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 2 for SIBs w as successfull y prepar ed thr ough the h ydr othermal method. Among the man y P2 lay ered materials, w e chose the low -cost Mn base tran sition metal Fig. 1 1. First principles computations: (a-d) partial density of states of Mn; (e-h) partial density of states of Co; (i-k) partial density of states of O; (m) the corresponding migration energy barriers of NM and NCM2; (n) structural diagram of Na + migration in NCM2. C. cheng Fu, J. W ang, Y. Li et al. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 9 1 8 (2022) 1 65569 9 o xide Na 0.67 MnO 2 to study. The electrochemical stability of Na 0.67 MnO 2 is poor, which is mainly for the sake of Na+ / v acancy along with the slip of the MO 2 lay er during the process of sodium ion de-inter calation, causing the irr eversible phase transition. The po sitiv e effects of Co doping on Na 0.67 MnO 2 wer e comprehensi vel y charact erized by the morphology, crystal structur e, and charge sto rag e mechanism. Co doping at the Mn site increases the proport ion of Mn 4+ and JahnT eller effect distortion is effectiv ely suppressed pro ven by DFT and XPS tests. Na 0.67 Co 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 2 still has 88. 7 % capacity ret ention rat e after 20 0 cy cles at 2 C and the re versibility and cy cling stability of the material ha ve been significantly im pro ved pro ved by tests. Co-doping modification can achieve pre ferabl y cy cle stability for sodium ion batt eries.

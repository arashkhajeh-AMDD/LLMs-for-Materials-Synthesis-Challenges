Powder X-ray diffraction showed that all samples crystallize with the spinel crystal structure (S.G. Fd3 ̄m). The cubic unit-cell parameter increases with the Ti content. The influence of the Ti content and cationic distribution on the magnetic properties of the compounds was studied by measuring the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the magnetization: substitution by non-magnetic d 0 Ti4+ ions appeared to weaken the magnetic interactions between the manganese ions.

Introduction The normal spinel-type compound Li Mn3+ Mn4+ O4 presents mixed conductivity: ionic conductivity is ensured by diffusion of Li+ ions through the channels formed by the connected vacant sites of the three-dimensional structure, while electronic conductivity results from hopping of electrons between the Mn3+ and Mn4+ occupied crystallographic sites [1]. This compound has recently attracted much interest due to its potential application as a cathode material for solid state batteries [2]. However its capacity loss during cycling has up to now hindered the development of practical applications [3]. Various substitutions of manganese by other transition metal cations have been investigated in order to improve or modify the electrochemical behaviour [4–6]. In the present study, we report our results about the LiMn2 −xTixO4 solid solution (with 0≤x≤1). Progressive substitution of Mn4+ cations by non-magnetic d0 Ti4+ ions might improve the understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern the interactions between manganese ions in LiMn2O4-type compounds. Most previous results published in the literature by other groups concerned (i) the x≤0.2 range only [7,8] or (ii) the use of a very specific technique applied to only one defined chemical composition (EXAFS for LiMn1.5Ti0.5O4 [9], EELS for LiMnTiO4 [10], XPS for LiMnTiO4 [11]). More recently, a publication by Arillo et al. [12] reported a thorough study of the LiMnTiO4 compound by X-ray and neutron diffractions, magnetic and transport measurements. The originality of this work lies in the fact that we report results for the whole solid solution up to x=1. We also compare the electrical transport properties of samples prepared by two different methods, displaying different microstructures, pointing out the role played by the microstructure on the physical properties. While writing the present paper, we have become aware of a recent publication by Petrov et al. [13]: in that paper, the authors put forward a new structural model with partial occupancy of the 8a crystallographic site by Mn2+ instead of Ti4+. That issue will be further discussed in the “Results and discussion” section. The present paper is organised as follows. The synthesis of the LiMn2−xTixO4 samples (where 0≤x≤1) by solid state reaction and Pechini technique is described in the Experimental Solid State Ionics 177 (2006) 1033–1040 www.elsevier.com/locate/ssi ⁎ Corresponding author.

Krins et al. / Solid State Ionics 177 (2006) 1033–1040 were ground in an agate mortar with petroleum ether and were heated to 623 K during 1 h. The resulting powders were ground again and pressed into pellets by isostatic pressing under 2100 bar. The pellets were sintered during 24 h in air, at 1073 K for the samples with x=0 and 0.25, and at 1223 K for the samples with x=0.5, 0.75 and 1. A LiMnTiO4 sample was also prepared by a precursor method (Pechini method [2]), in order to investigate the influence of the microstructure on the conductivity measurements. Titanium isopropoxide, manganese acetate and lithium carbonate were dissolved in ethylene glycol. The addition of citric acid led to the formation of a gel, which was dried at 493 K. The precursor was calcined at 623 K during 8 h, pelletized and sintered at 1223 K during 24 h. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected using a Philips PW-3710 diffractometer with FeKα (λ=1.9373 Å) radiation. The scans were performed between 2θ=20° and 2θ=150° with a step size of 0.020° and a counting time of 8 s/step. The structure refinement was carried out by Rietveld analysis using the DBWS-9807 program [14]. The microstructural properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30 ESEM). The Mn/Ti ratio was measured by Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX system coupled to the electron microscope). The lithium loss resulting from the thermal treatment was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry measurements. The DC magnetic moment was measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field between 5 and 350 K with a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) from Quantum Design and a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) from Oxford Instruments. AC transport measurements were carried out using a Solartron 1260 Impedance Gain Phase Analyser with a frequency range of 10 Hz–10 MHz between 298 and 650 K. Both sides of the pellets were coated with gold in order to ensure good electrical contact with the gold blocking electrodes.

Powder X-ray diffraction Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of all samples prepared by solid state reaction could be refined in the Fd3 ̄m space group (Fig. 1). It turns out that the spinel structure of LiMn2O4 is retained in the substituted compounds LiMn2−xTixO4 (0≤x≤1). For x≥0.5, the ordered structural model with lithium in tetrahedral 8a site and manganese and titanium in the octahedral 16d site did not give satisfactory results. Consequently, it was necessary to introduce some disorder in the cationic distribution in order to account for the observed electron density in the 8a and 16d sites. Previous results of X-ray and neutron diffractions for LiMnTiO4 by Arillo et al. [11,12] had shown that manganese was exclusively on the 16d site, while titanium was distributed in both 16d and 8a sites. Therefore a first model was used where the Mn-content of the 16d site was fixed to its nominal value and where Li+ against Ti4+ were refined in Fig. 2. Cubic lattice parameter and Mn percentage in the 8a site as a function of the titanium content. Fig. 3. Main figure: temperature dependence of the Field Cooled (FC) (white symbol) and Zero Field Cooled (ZFC) (black symbol) magnetization under μ0HDC=0.1 T for the samples with x=0.25 (triangle) and 0.75 (square). Only one third of data points are shown on the figure. Inset: Curie (C) and Weiss (θ) constants obtained by fitting a Curie–Weiss law to the ZFC magnetization data for the samples LiMn2−xTixO4 (0≤x≤1). 1036 N. Krins et al. / Solid State Ionics 177 (2006) 1033–1040 the 8a and 16d sites. The occupancy factors calculated from this model (Model 1) are given in Table 1. The good fit between the refined site scattering values (RSS) and the calculated site scattering values (CSS) seem to confirm this cationic distribution. However, the calculated bond valence sums (CBV) for the 8a crystallographic site are significantly different from the expected bond valence sums (EBV) when 0.5≤x≤1.0 (Table 1). Because the bond valence sums are very sensitive to any change of ionic radii, they constitute a good tool to distinguish between Mn2+, Mn3+, Mn4+ and Ti4+ occupancy for a given crystallographic site. For this reason, the differences between the CBV and the EBV indicate that the 8a crystallographic site probably contains larger cations than Li+ and Ti4+, when 0.5≤x≤1.0. Recently, Petrov et al. [13] proposed another model for the cationic distribution in LiMn2−yTiyO4 (0.2≤y≤1.0), in which Mn2+ shares the 8a position with Li, whereas Ti4+, Mn3+, Mn4+ and a small amount of Li occur in the 16d site. A new series of refinements was performed according to this model (Model 2), by constraining the Ti content of the 16d site to its nominal value, and by refining Mn against Li in the 8a and 16d sites. As shown in Table 1, the CBV are now in much better agreement with the EBV, indicating that this model is more realistic than the previous one. The unit-cell parameters and reliability factors are given in Table 2, and the final atomic coordinates, site occupancy factors, and isotropic thermal parameters are given in Table 3. For completeness, the CBVand EBV were also calculated in the case of Mn3+ sharing the 8a position with Li, but the agreement was not better than in the case of Model 2. In conclusion our XRD refinements appear to confirm the results of Petrov et al. [13], although it contradicts the XPS results of Arillo et al. [11]. Investigation by other methods would be necessary in order to confirm the cationic distribution of Model 2. The occupancy factors obtained with models 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 3) indicate that the main substitution mechanism involved in the LiMn2−xTixO4 solid solution is a replacement of Mn4+ by Ti4+ on the 16d site. However, in Model 2, Mn3+ is also partially replaced by Mn2+ and Mn4+, thus indicating a secondary substitution mechanism 2Mn3+ (16d)=Mn2+ (8a)+Mn4+ (16d). For x=1.00, 0.300 Mn3+ per formula unit (p.f.u.) are replaced by 0.158 Mn2+ p.f.u. on the 8a site, and by 0.144 Mn4+ p.f.u. on the 16d site (Tables 1 and 3), thus confirming the existence of this minor substitution mechanism. Whatever the structural model considered, the cubic unit-cell parameter (Table 2) was found to increase with the titanium content (Fig. 2), as could be expected considering the difference in ionic radii between Mn4+ (rMn4+(VI)=0.530 Å) and Ti4+ (rTi4 +(VI)=0.605 Å) [15], which are the cations involved in the main substitution mechanism. As shown in Fig. 2, the increase of the unit-cell parameter is not linear, probably because the secondary substitution mechanism disturbs the ideal Mn4+=Ti4+ replacement scheme. As shown in Fig. 2, the proportion of manganese in the 8a site, which also probably has an influence on the unitcell parameter, does not increase linearly as a function of the substitution level. By comparison with results from the literature [12,13], the percentage of transition metal ions in the 8a site was found to be significantly smaller in the case of the present samples and the cubic unit-cell parameter is also smaller than in the literature for x≥0.5. This could be due to the nature of the different reactants used for the solid state synthesis: carbonate, acetate and hydroxide salts used in the present study are more reactive than commercial oxides. Finally, it was found that the Mn/Ti ratios determined by Rietveld refinement agree well with the results deduced from EDX analysis. A lithium loss resulting from the thermal treatment was expected and thus evaluated by atomic absorption spectrometry and did not exceed 5%. M (A/m) μ0H (T) Fig. 4. Main figure: field dependence of the magnetization of the samples LiMn2−xTixO4 (with x=0.25, 0.5, 1) at 10 K. Inset: magnetization (in μB/Mn) for μ0H=5 T, at 10 and 100 K, as a function of the titanium content. 1037 N. Krins et al. / Solid State Ionics 177 (2006) 1033–1040 3.2. Magnetic properties The magnetic properties of all samples prepared by solid state reaction were measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The temperature dependence of the magnetization under μ0HDC=0.1 T was collected in Field Cooled (FC) and Zero Field Cooled (ZFC) conditions, between 5 and 350 K. Fig. 3 shows the results for the samples with x=0.25 and 0.75. For the clarity of the figure, only data in the 5–80K range are displayed. In the case of the x=0.25 sample, the FC and ZFC curves diverge below 40 K. The ZFC curve shows a maximum at 30 K while the FC magnetization increases down to the lowest temperature. When the Ti content is increased, the difference between the FC and ZFC curves becomes very small. The ZFC magnetization data above 150 K could be fitted by a Curie–Weiss law 1/χ=−θ/C+T/C. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the values of the Curie constant (C) and Weiss constant (θ) as a function of Ti content. θ is negative for all samples, which could be the signature of local antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. The absolute value of θ decreases when the Ti content is increased: this behaviour results from the weakening of the magnetic interactions between manganese ions, due to the substitution of d0 Ti4+ ions in the Mn–O network. In order to try to confirm the validity of the cationic distributions determined by Rietveld refinement, experimental values for the effective moment μ were calculated from the Curie constants and compared to the theoretical values calculated for models 1 and 2. However it was not possible to conclude because the difference between the experimental and theoretical values (typically 0.3 μB) is much larger than the difference between the theoretical values for the two structural models (typically less than 0.05 μB). The magnetic field dependence of the magnetization was measured at 10 and 100 K for μ0HDC between −2 and 2 T. The data at 10 K for the samples with x=0.25, 0.5 and 1 are shown in Fig. 4. When the Ti content is increased, both the coercive field and remnant magnetization decrease. d0 Ti4+ ions do not contribute to the magnetic moment, therefore it is interesting to normalise the magnetic moment with respect to manganese content: the inset of Fig. 4 presents the magnetic moment of all samples in Bohr magneton per manganese ion (μB/Mn), for μ0H=5 T, at 10 and 100 K. The magnetic moment in μB/Mn increases when more titanium is substituted into the spinel structure. Indeed, when the Ti4+ content is increased, the average Fig. 5. Electron micrographs of non-polished fractures of LiMnTiO4 pellets prepared (a) by solid state reaction or (b) by Pechini method. Fig. 6. Complex impedance plot at 298 K for LiMnTiO4 synthesized by Pechini and solid state routes. 1038 N. Krins et al. / Solid State Ionics 177 (2006) 1033–1040 oxidation state of manganese decreases and the average number of d electrons per manganese ion increases. However the observed increase of magnetic moment is more pronounced than the linear dependence expected by this mechanism only. This confirms that Ti substitution tends to weaken the local antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn ions, as a result of the dilution of the Mn–O network by non-magnetic Ti4+ cations. 3.3. Electrical properties The electrical properties of the LiMnTiO4 compound were studied by AC impedance spectroscopy. In order to investigate the influence of the microstructure of the samples on the conductivity, samples prepared by two different synthesis methods were compared. Fig. 5 presents electron micrographs of non-polished fractures of LiMnTiO4 pellets prepared by solid state reaction (Fig. 5a) or Pechini method (Fig. 5b). The solid state sample is characterized by the presence of large pores and a poor connectivity between well-sintered agglomerates. On the contrary, the Pechini sample seems denser and displays better connectivity. These observations were confirmed by density measurements on the bulk pellets by Archimedes' method: the total porosity (open+closed) values obtained by this method were 18% and 30% for the pellets prepared by Pechini method and solid state reaction respectively. AC impedance measurements were performed at different temperatures between 298 and 650 K on sintered pellets of LiMnTiO4 prepared by Pechini method or solid state reaction. Fig. 6 presents the complex impedance plots recorded at 298 K for both samples. The impedance plot for the Pechini sample can be described as two semicircles. Assuming a series model, the semicircle at high frequency can be attributed to the intragrain conductivity while the semicircle at lower frequency is related to the intergrain effects. The impedance plot for the solid state sample presents only one semicircle, whose low-frequency tail probably results from an electrode-related artefact [16]. Assuming that both samples have similar intragrain properties, the fact that only one semicircle is observed for the solid state sample suggests close values of time constants for the conductivity processes through grains and intergrain spaces. The microstructural analysis has revealed the high porosity of that sample. The geometrical capacitance associated to the large voids inside the material would be very small (0.2 pF for the solid state sample compared to 7.7 pF for the Pechini sample), which would result in a decrease of the time constant of about two orders of magnitude when compared to the Pechini sample. The significant influence of the porosity of the sample on the transport behaviour is confirmed by the higher total resistivity observed for the most porous sample (solid state sample). The influence of the temperature on the overall conductivity is shown in Fig. 7, where the data for both samples are fitted by an Arrhenius equation σ=A exp(−Ea/kT). It turned out that the two samples present a similar activation energy, Ea ∼0.38 eV. This indicates that the temperature dependence of the conductivity is probably controlled by the same activated conduction mechanism for both samples. The activation energy value does not allow to conclude about the ionic and/or electronic character of the conductivity [17]. Therefore the complementary charge–discharge experiments were carried out at room temperature. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for the two samples. The data for the solid state sample are shown in the inset of Fig. 7. It can be seen that the total charge passed during the discharge process is ∼0, revealing the predominant electronic character of the conduction process. The resistivity values deduced from the charge process data agree well with the low-frequency resistivity observed by AC impedance measurements. Fig. 7.

Conclusion LiMn2−xTixO4 compounds with 0≤x≤1 were prepared by solid state reaction and Pechini technique. Powder X-ray diffraction showed that all samples crystallize with the spinellike crystal structure (S.G. Fd3 ̄m). The cubic unit-cell parameter increases with Ti content. Rietveld refinements were carried out considering two different structural models, with Ti4+ (Model 1) or Mn2+ (Model 2) sharing the 8a site with Li. The best fit was obtained for Model 2, despite the contradiction with previous XPS results from the literature. The magnetic properties measurements did not settle the issue and additional investigation is needed. The influence of the Ti content on the magnetic properties of the compounds was studied by measuring the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the magnetization: substitution by non-magnetic d0 Ti4+ ions appeared to weaken the magnetic interactions between manganese ions. The electrical properties of LiMnTiO4 were studied by AC impedance spectroscopy and DC polarisation measurements, which revealed the electronic character of the conduction process.

Introduction Lithium manganese oxide, LiMn2O4, has the cubic spinel structure. An increasing interest has developed around the Li–Mn–O spinels due to their potential use as positive electrode materials in lithium ion rechargeable batteries [1]. The vast majority of the studies devoted to these compounds deal with their electrochemical characteristics, but, only very recently, their structural and physical properties have also been investigated using polycrystalline samples [2]. The stoichiometric compound LiMn2O4 presents a first order structural transition close to room temperature [3]. In the case of manganese perovskite oxides, structural phase transitions accompanied by sharp modifications of electronic and magnetic properties have been attributed to charge ordering [4]. However, the mechanism of the structural transition has not been clarified yet in the case of the spinel-type LiMn2O4. The crystal structure of the low temperature form has been investigated using neutron and synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction methods. Rousse and her co-workers [2,5,6] and Massarotti et al. [7] reported an orthorhombic  3a3aa superstructure of the basic cubic spinel structure, induced by a partial charge ordering on the manganese sites [2]. The powder technique, however, does not fully solve the problem, because it only provides a structure refinement using the starting model structure. To clarify the true crystal symmetry, the precise crystal structure, the mechanism of the structural transition, and the physical properties of *Corresponding author. Tel./fax: +81-298-54-4555.

In the present study, we report the single crystal growth, chemical characterization of the spinel-type LiMn2O4, and the preliminary results of single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments below room temperature. 2. Experimental procedure Single crystals were grown by a solvent evaporation flux method. Starting LiMn2O4 powder samples were supplied by Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Japan. In order to find the best conditions to grow single crystals, we examined some flux materials, e.g., LiCl (3N), Li2O2 (3N), Li2CO3 (4N), and Li metal (2Nup). They were mixed with LiMn2O4 in various ratios and fired at several temperatures in gold crucibles. The produced single crystals were easily separated from the frozen flux materials by rinsing the gold tube in water for several minutes. The products were observed by using an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM: JEOL JSM-5400). Chemical compositions for single crystal specimens were analyzed by SEM-EDX and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. Single crystals were carefully examined with an Xray precession camera (MoKa radiation) in order to check on crystal quality and to determine the lattice parameters, systematic extinctions, and possible superstructures. The intensity data of the cubic spinel structure were collected by the 2y2o scan mode with a scan rate of 18/min at 297K on a fourcircle diffractometer (Rigaku AFC-7R, operating conditions: 50kV, 180mA) using graphite-monochromatized MoKa radiation (l 1⁄4 0:71073 (A). Temperature dependence of the structure between 230 and 330 K was investigated on the fourcircle diffractometer using a nitrogen gas flow cryostat. The temperature was stable at 0.5 K. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction peak profiles were measured after equilibrium of the crystal specimen for 30 min at a given temperature. 3. Results and discussion Single crystals of LiMn2O4 were obtained only when LiCl was used as a flux (the nominal weight ratio of LiMn2O4 : LiCl=1 : 8) and heated typically at 1173 K for 10 days in a covered gold crucible. It should be noted that a control of the evaporation speed of the LiCl flux at high temperatures is very important to grow the single crystals in the present experiment. The crystals are black in color and, as seen in Fig. 1, octahedral-shaped with typical dimensions of about 0.05  0.05  0.05 mm3. Fig. 2 shows the Fig. 1. Scanning electron microphotograph of typical as-grown single crystals of LiMn2O4. Fig. 2. Scanning electron microphotograph of an octahedralshaped single crystal of LiMn2O4. J. Akimoto et al. / Journal of Crystal Growth 229 (2001) 405–408 406 largest single crystal of 0.09  0.09  0.09 mm3 along the octahedral edges. The triangular plane was determined to be of the cubic {1 1 1} plane by the X-ray precession photographs. SEM-EDX analysis showed that the crystals were free from gold contamination from the crucible. The chemical analysis by ICP spectroscopy using the pulverized crystals confirmed the stoichiometric chemical composition. The cubic spinel structure with Fd%3m space group has been confirmed by X-ray precession photographs taken at 298 K using MoKa radiation. The structural parameters were refined using a four-circle X-ray diffraction data taken at 297 K and reported elsewhere [9]. A summary of the crystallographic data is given in Table 1. The refined lattice parameter and the oxygen parameter x are in good agreement with the previous results for the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 using neutron powder diffraction data [10,11]. The oxygen occupation was refined to the nominal value within the experimental error. Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of single-crystal X-ray diffraction peak profiles of the cubic (4 0 0) reflection from 300 to 230 K. The peak intensity starts to decrease at 285 K, and the peak splits into three components at lower temperatures. This fact suggests the structural phase transition takes place at about 285 K on the cooling process. The tripled periodicity toward the aand b-axis directions of the low temperature form has also been confirmed. The additional (2 3 10 3 0) superlattice reflection can be clearly observed below the transition temperature, as shown in Fig. 4. Accordingly, the  3a3aa orthorhombic lattice parameters were determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method to be a 1⁄4 24:752ð11Þ (A, b 1⁄4 24:842ð11Þ (A, and c 1⁄4 8:209ð4Þ (A at 270 K.

Conclusion Single crystals of the spinel-type LiMn2O4 have been successfully grown by a solvent evaporation flux method at 1173 K. The maximum size of the octahedral-shaped single crystal is 0.09  0.09  0.09 mm3 along the octahedral edges. From the results of chemical and structural analyses, it is concluded that the stoichiometric single crystals of LiMn2O4 with ideal spinel structure, having the cubic Fd%3m space group and the lattice parameter of a 1⁄4 8:2483ð6Þ (A, and with high crystallinity are obtained in the present study. The preliminary single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments revealed the  3a3aa-type orthorhombic structure of the low temperature form. References [1] M.M. Thackeray, Prog.

Res. Bull. 25, 657 (1990)], was approached using three di4erent preparation routes: low-temperature solid state reaction (A), chemical delithiation (B), and electrochemical delithiation (C). Rietveld re5nements from neutron di4raction data con5rmed the double-vacancy scheme proposed previously for product A, but with more tetrahedral and fewer octahedral vacancies than in the ideal Li2Mn4O9 formula. Low-temperature solid state reactions systematically result in broad re6ections. Sample B, which was obtained topotactically, exhibits much narrower re6ections. But chemical analyses, thermogravimetry, and neutron di4raction show that the acid treatment introduces signi5cant amounts of protons, resulting in a formula close to Li0.92HMn4O9. Samples A and B were cycled electrochemically in lithium cells at 3 V with better stability than LiMn2O4, probably due to their higher initial manganese oxidation state. No separate electrochemical step linked to the 5lling of vacancies is observed in A, whereas B gives an additional redox step ca. 200 mV above the main plateau. This feature is not observed on compounds A or C; it is reversible, and seems to be a speci5c property of this spinel with a low initial cell parameter (8.09 A_ ). Sample A2 with double cation vacancies is especially stable on cycling at 3 V, and shows a very small volume variation on lithium intercalation.

INTRODUCTION The Li}Mn}O spinel system gives rise to a rich crystal chemistry and a wide interest due to its potential applications in lithium batteries (1}3). A range of stoichiometric compositions is known between the limiting compounds LiMn2O4 and Li4Mn5O12, as well as phases containing tetrahedral site vacancies, such as j-MnO2. A very peculiar case in this system is Li2Mn4O9, initially reported by de Kock et al. (4). This compound is interesting, because (i) it contains tetravalent manganese only and (ii) its structure contains cation vacancies on both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. From a neutron di!raction study, de Kock et al. indeed concluded the structural formula (Li8@9h1@9)[Mn16@9 h2@9]O4 in spinel stoichiometry, where ( ) and [ ] indicate the tetrahedral and octahedral site contents, respectively. Such a high cation de"ciency could lead to high lithium intercalation capacity, although the reversibility of intercalation in such sites is doubtful a priori. The synthesis of Li2Mn4O9, however, is di$cult, and subsequent attempts by several groups (3, 5}7) to reproduce de Kock's result yielded products with a manganese oxidation state l(Mn) never exceeding #3.85, while this composition was cited in several recent works without any manganese oxidation state determination (8}10). In this work, we reconsider the Li2Mn4O9 case, using three di!erent preparation routes. The stoichiometric issues considered here and their relevance to lithium intercalation can be conveniently illustrated using a composition}valence phase diagram, using as coordinate axes the Li/Mn ratio and the manganese oxidation state l(Mn) (11). In this representation (Fig. 1), lithium intercalation/extraction reactions follow parallel lines with slope !1, the length of which is directly proportional to the capacity in the case of an electrochemical intercalation/extraction process. In addition, l(Mn) is immediately visible for any composition. Figure 1 shows relevant compositions such as the stoichiometric spinel solution Li1`aMn2~aO4, with its limits a"0 (LiMn2O4) and a"1/3 (Li4Mn5O12), typical compositions located in the cation-de"cient range (j-MnO2"hMn2O4, and Li2Mn4O9), as well as the limit of occurrence of tetragonal distorsion of the spinel structure due to the Jahn-Teller cation Mn3`. De Kock et al. prepared &&Li2Mn4O9'' by direct solid state reaction from MnO2 and LiOH. Figure 1 shows that such a composition can be reached topotactically, by lithium extraction from a stoichiometric spinel belonging to the Li1`aMn2~aO4 line.

Composition}valence phase diagram for the Li}Mn}O system. The expected topotactic lithium extraction yielding Li2Mn4O9 starts from composition P (see text). spinel'' is simply determined by the condition Mn/O"4/9, resulting in the initial formula Li11@9Mn16@9O4 (a"2/9, point P in Fig. 1). However, lithium extraction is expected to occur preferentially from the tetrahedral sites, yielding a spinel with cation distribution (Li6@9h3@9)[Mn16@9Li2@9] O4, instead of (Li8@9h1@9)[Mn16@9h2@9]O4 in de Kock's formula. So it seems possible to prepare two Li}Mn}O spinels with similar overall stoichiometry Li2Mn4O9, but di+erent vacancy distribution. A comparison of their lithium intercalation properties is expected to be very interesting. Finally, the topotactic preparation of Li2Mn4O9 by delithiation can, in principle, be achieved both chemically and electrochemically; both routes will be investigated here. This paper describes the crystallographic and electrochemical properties of these &&isomers,'' made by (1) de Kock's low-temperature solid state reaction procedure and (2) chemical and (3) electrochemical lithium extraction. While this work was in progress, an alternate route to Li2Mn4O9 was published by Choi and Manthiram, using a lithium peroxide precursor (7). These authors made no attempt to determine the vacancy scheme of their spinel samples. Their results will be compared to ours herein. 2. EXPERIMENTAL Samples a% la de Kock (hereafter named &&A'') were made by solid state reaction between b-MnO2 and LiOH at 400}5003C in air. For routes 2 and 3 above, the starting material was Li1.22Mn1.78O4 powder (sample named &&P'' throughout this paper), which was prepared by solid state reaction from appropriate ratios of the same reagents at 6003C. Chemical delithiation was carried out by stirring 11 g of sample P in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 20 hours (12). The sample was then "ltered, washed with distilled water, and dried in air at 803C. Electrochemical delithiation was made by a galvanostatic charge on sample P up to 4.30 V in a lithium cell. Samples obtained by chemical and electrochemical delithiation are named B and C, respectively. Manganese oxidation states were determined by wet titrimetry using the oxalate}permanganate procedure, with at least three measurements per sample and an accuracy better than 1% (13). Quantitative elemental analysis of lithium (for sample B) and manganese was carried out on a PerkinElmer PA-360 atomic absorption spectrometer on samples dissolved in 2.5 M hydrochloric acid. The composition of sample B was determined from the combination of Li content, total Mn content, and oxidation state measurement; a detailed derivation of the formula from such anaytical data has been published by Feng et al. (14). The thermogravimetric behavior of samples B and P was determined on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 apparatus at heating rates in the range 0.5}43C min~1 in dry oxygen. X-ray di!raction characterization was carried out using a Siemens D-5000 di!ractometer with CuKa radiation. Neutron powder di!raction patterns were collected on the high-resolution two-axis D2B di!ractometer at Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France, with a wavelength of 1.5938 A_ on powder samples A and B loosely packed in vanadium cylindrical cans. This measurement could not be carried out on sample C because it requires sample quantities Z10 g. Structures were re"ned using the Rietveld method (Fullprof program (15)), using pseudo-Voigt pro"le functions. For electrochemical studies, the active material was mixed with 20% carbon black and 10% PTFE emulsion. Cathodic pellets were cut from the resulting paste and dried under vacuum at 1203C for 15 hours before use. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in EC-DMC (Merck), and the anode was lithium foil. Coin-type or Swagelok cells were assembled in a glove box with (1 ppm H2O. Batteries were tested in either galvanostatic or potentiostatic mode at room temperature using a MacPile controller. Throughout this paper, all lithium intercalation levels x will refer to the normal spinel formula unit containing four oxygen atoms. 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Syntheses and X-Ray Diwraction X-ray di!raction shows that all samples prepared have the spinel structure. Cell parameters and analytical data are given in Table 1. The solid state reaction procedure a% la de Kock consistently yielded products containing traces of unreacted lithium carbonate and/or manganese dioxide, broad X-ray re#ections, and a manganese oxidation state l(Mn) much lower than the theoretical value 4.0 expected for the ideal composition Li2Mn4O9 (see values in Table 1). 109 CATION-DEFICIENT Li}Mn}O SPINELS TABLE 1 Preparation Conditions and Characterization of Samples Synthesis Analytical data X-ray data temperature Sample Synthesis procedure (3C) Li/Mn l(Mn) Formula a (As ) FWHMa (32h) de Kock (4) Solid state reaction 400 0.50b n.d.c Li1~xMn2~2xO4 8.162 (X-rays) +1.5d Choi (7) Via Li2O2 in aqueous medium 400 0.50b 3.77e Li0.94Mn1.88O4 8.107(28) +1.5d A0 Solid state reaction 400 * 3.82e Li0.93Mn1.86O4 8.137(8) 1.35 A1 Solid state reaction 425 * n.d. 8.153(9) 0.51 A2 Solid state reaction 500 * 3.69e Li0.95Mn1.90O4 8.179(3) 0.37 B Chemical delithiation 25 0.23e 4.02e Li0.41H3 0.45Mn1.78O4 8.091(2) 0.27 C Electrochemical delithiation 25 0.50e 4.00e Li0.88Mn1.78O4 8.141(2) 0.32 Pf Solid state reaction 600 0.687b 3.81b Li1.22Mn1.78O4 8.163(2) 0.27 a Full width at half-maximum of 311 re#ections. b From overall stoichiometry. c Not determined; 4.07 from neutron re"nement of site occupations. d Estimated from Fig. 2 in Ref.

Evolution of spinel cell parameter a, 311-re#ection full width at half-maximum (F=HM), and Mn oxidation state as a function of reaction temperature. A considerable decrease in both unreacted reagents' content and spinel re#ections linewidths could be achieved by increasing the reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 2. However, this process also decreased l(Mn), thus bringing the composition even farther from the ideal one. Despite this low manganese valence, the cell parameter of sample A2 agrees well with that reported by de Kock et al. (4), but it is signi"cantly higher that those observed on A0}A1 and on delithiated samples B and C. This is consistent with a lower l(Mn) in sample A2 and again in disagreement with the ideal formula Li2Mn4O9. Samples prepared by the hydrogen peroxide route in a similar temperature range also exhibit broad X-ray re#ections (7). In that case, an increase in synthesis temperature resulted in a decrease in X-ray linewidths, but also in the formation of Mn2O3 impurity above 4503C. The cell parameter value reported for the 4003C sample is very low and determined with a high uncertainty (see Table 1), possibly indicating a particular cation/vacancy distribution. For the topotactic synthesis of sample C by electrochemical delithiation, the reaction progress can be followed by the voltage pro"le in the lithium cell used, starting with composition P as the positive electrode. This curve (see Fig. 3) shows a voltage plateau at ca. 4.1 V, which is typical of lithium extraction from the tetrahedral spinel sites (1). The capacity expected for Li1.22Mn1.78O4 up to the limit l(Mn) "4 (0.33 Li extracted per formula unit) is reached at +4.25 V, and this limit shows up as the onset of a domain with a steeper potential increase in the chronopotentiometric curve (Fig. 3). Sample B gave the cleanest X-ray di!raction pattern, with no line broadening with respect to its parent compound P and an experimental l(Mn) value equal to 4.0 within experimental errors. But it also yielded a much lower lithium content than expected (Li/Mn"0.23, see Table 1). This result can be explained taking into account the possibility of proton exchange for lithium during acidic treatment. Several studies (14, 16) showed indeed that acidic treatment of Li1`aMn2~aO4 spinels gives rise to an increasing exchange of Li` by protons with increasing manganese valence, i.e., 110 PALOS, ANNE, AND STROBEL FIG. 3. Evolution of cell voltage as a function of lithium content during room-temperature electrochemical delithiation from Li1.22Mn1.78 O4 (two cells shown). FIG. 4. Thermogravimetric analysis in oxygen of sample B, obtained by chemical delithiation from stoichiometric spinel P (Li1.22Mn1.78O4). The TG trace of sample P is shown at the top (thin line with triangle marks). with increasing a value. Analytical data give a composition Li0.41H+0.45Mn1.78O4 (or Li0.92HMn4O9), i.e., a vacant spinel with partial replacement of Li` by H`. These formulas are in good agreement with the ratio of lithium lost by oxidative extraction and by proton exchange expected as a function of manganese valence from previous studies (14). The di!erence in cell parameter between samples B and C, obtained by chemical or electrochemical delithiation (see Table 1), can be explained by this major di!erence in composition. Whereas the manganese valence is the same between samples B and C, an important fraction of lithium has been replaced by protons in the former, resulting in a signi"cantly smaller cell parameter. 3.2. Thermogravimetric Analysis The presence of protons was con"rmed by thermogravimetry (TG). The thermal stabilities of the stoichiometric spinel P and sample B are compared in Fig. 4. While the former shows a negligible mass change up to 5003C in oxygen, the acid-treated sample B undergoes a continuous mass loss starting at ca. 1203C. This feature is irreversible and probably results from a succession of several steps as a function of temperature, as shown by slope changes in Fig. 4. Unfortunately, these steps are poorly separated, even at low heating rate (0.53C min~1, see dotted line in Fig. 4). Possible causes for mass losses in this sample are (i) the presence of protons, as hydratation molecules or hydroxyl groups, (ii) structural rearrangements due the presence of vacancies, and (iii) reduction of tetravalent manganese. This last factor prompted us to perform the TG measurements in oxygen, with the intent to delay reductive decomposition reactions. Experimental results show that at 3503C in oxygen, this proton-containing, lacunar spinel is already decomposed to b-MnO2 and a spinel phase with higher cell parameter, i.e., higher lithium content (a"8.147 As , compared to 8.091 A_ for sample B). The composition obtained in Section 3.1. for sample B yields a mass loss of 2.73% for the departure of protons (as water). This corresponds to a temperature of 3503C in the slow-heating TG curve in Fig. 4, showing that protons are strongly bonded in spinel B. In addition, the mass loss is very small below 1203C, further con"rming that protons are not present as adsorbed water. These results are consistent with Feng's study (14), in which it was concluded that the mass loss up to ca. 3003C was due to protons introduced by ion exchange in acid-treated Li1`aMn2~aO4 spinels. 3.3. Neutron Diwraction Final Rietveld re"nements from neutron di!raction data included the following variables: (i) global parameters: zero-shift correction, four to six background polynomial coe$cients, (ii) pro"le parameters for the spinel phase: scale 111 CATION-DEFICIENT Li}Mn}O SPINELS FIG. 5. Observed (points) and calculated (continuous line) neutron powder patterns of samples A2 (from solid state reaction a% la de Kock) and B (from chemical lithium extraction). Di!erences I0"4}I#!-# are shown at the bottom. factor, unit cell parameter, four pro"le parameters for the pseudo-Voigt function, (iii) structural parameters: oxygen position parameter, isotropic displacement coe$cients B*40 for manganese and oxygen sites, occupancies of all sites but oxygen. B*40 could not be re"ned for lithium, because a strong correlation with site occupancy resulted in unreasonably large standard deviations. It was thus "xed to 1.50 A_ 2; a test with a value of 1.0 showed an e!ect of less than 4% on the 8a site occupancy. For sample A2, a bMnO2 phase was included, with the same pro"le parameters as those for the main spinel phase, and only cell parameters re"ned. For sample B, both lithium and manganese were placed on octahedral 16d sites and varied independently. This strategy resulted in 17 and 20 variables for samples A2 and B, respectively. Observed and calculated neutron diffraction patterns and re"nement parameters are given in Fig. 5 and Table 2, respectively. Samples of the A series yielded broad neutron di!raction peaks, just as already noted for X rays. This, together with the presence of unreacted starting materials, precluded any satisfactory re"nement for sample A1 (prepared at 4253C). The 5003C sample A2 could be re"ned, taking into account the weak lines of b-MnO2. Its neutron di!raction diagram also showed a broad hump centered at 43.33 2h (also present in sample B, see Figs. 5a and 5b). The origin of this feature is not known; the 42}443 range, which does not include any spinel re#ection, was excluded from the re"nement. Results are summarized in Table 2. The large linewidths made the pro"le di$cult to "t and resulted in somewhat high R1 and R81 values. The possibility of "nding lithium on octahedral 16d sites was tested and found negligible. Our re"nement (see Table 2) con"rms the double vacancy scheme proposed by de Kock et al. (4). But the composition of A2 deviates signi"cantly from the ideal Li2Mn4O9 formula, yielding vacancy fractions larger on tetrahedral sites (as was already the case in Ref. (4)) and smaller on octahedral sites. This results in a calculated Mn valence of 3.83 in the spinel phase, still quite far from the ideal 4.00 value for Li2Mn4O9. 112 PALOS, ANNE, AND STROBEL TABLE 2 Results of Rietveld Re5nements from Neutron Di4raction Data: Spinel Structure, Space Group Fd31 m, x 5 y 5 z for All Sites Cell parameters (As ) Atom Site x, y, z Site Occupancy B*40 (A_ 2) Re"nement parameters Sample A2 (two-phase re"nement including b-MnO2) Spinel: Li 8a 0.125 0.78(2) 1.5 N!P#C 2441 8.1811(3) Mn 16d 0.5 0.94(1) 1.38(6) R1"4.37, R81"5.76 O 32e 0.26352(5) 1 1.17(3) R%91"1.61, RB3!''"4.68 b-MnO2: 35 spinel re#ections used a"4.3955(8) b"2.875(1) Formula for sample A2: (Li0.78h0.22)[Mn1.88h0.12] O4 According to Ref.

The presence of protons in sample B was con"rmed by a signi"cantly higher background, due to incoherent hydrogen scattering. In a "rst step, the structure was re"ned with lithium, manganese, and oxygen atoms only. Several proton sites located along O}O lines in the spinel structure were proposed previously for the formation of strong OH bonds on the basis of infrared spectroscopy data (17). Tests for all these yielded negative or negligible hydrogen occupations. A direct replacement of Li by H on the tetragonal 8a site was also ruled out because of an unreasonable 8a}O length for an O}H bond (18). Using Fourier di!erence maps, we found a possible proton site near 8a, but signi"cantly shifted from the center of the (8a}O4) tetrahedron toward one oxygen atom. Re"nements showed that this site could be described by a 32e position (x, x, x) with x"0.152. Strong correlations between this position parameter and Li1 and H occupancies did not allow an independent re"nement of these three variables. It was thus decided to proceed in two steps, re"ning (1) x(H) with occupancies "xed according to the analytical stoichiometry and (2) the Li1 and H occupancies with this x(H) "xed. Additional attempts to place H in a neighbouring 96 g site as proposed in Ref. (19) led to a poorer re"nement. Results (see Table 2, lower part) show a fairly good agreement with the chemical formula, given the e.s.d. on occupancies from neutron data. A remarkable result is the negliglible shift in composition on the 16d site after acidic treatment in sample B. No vacancies were found on this site (independent re"nements of Mn and Li occupancies on this site led to a total occupancy of 0.999). In contrast, the occupations of both Li1 (8a) and H sites are low, allowing the protons to occupy 32e sites adjacent to unoccupied lithium 8a sites. Mn}O and Li}O distances are given in Table 3. The experimental O}H bond length in sample B is 1.5642(3) A_ . This re"nement con"rms that an acid treatment on a Li1`aMn2~aO4 spinel (i) induces a partial exchange Li`} H`, (ii) has a negligible e!ect on the octahedral site content, and (iii) yields a spinel phase containing an important fraction of vacancies on the 8a site. The compositions of samples A2 and B, together with those of relevant nonvacant Li}Mn}O spinels studied by neutron di!raction, are shown in the phase diagram in Fig. 6. Li}O and Mn}O distances calculated from neutron data are compared in Table 3. The experimental Mn}O distances are 0.01}0.02 A_ smaller than expected from Shannon's ionic radii (18) (see Table 3, last column). Figure 6 shows that the variation in spinel cell parameters and Mn}O bond lengths can be accounted for by two main parameters: (i) the oxidation state of manganese, governing the bond length decrease along the LiMn2O4}MnO2 delithiation line and in the LiMn2O4}A2}B series, and (ii) the occupation of the B site. The availability of samples B and C allows us, for the "rst time, to place three points on an almost horizontal line in the diagram (dash-dotted line LixMn2O4}Li4Mn5O12 in Fig. 6), unambiguously showing that the octahedral cation}oxygen distance dB~O increases with increasing lithium fraction on this site at constant manganese valence. This bond length also increases with the 113 CATION-DEFICIENT Li}Mn}O SPINELS TABLE 3 Cation+Anion Distances in Selected Li+Mn+O Spinels As Determined from Neutron Di4raction Data (A 5 Tetrahedral Site, B 5 Octahedral Site) Cell dB~O, dA~O, SdB~OT Composition l(Mn)a Parameter (A_ ) x(O) exp.

Electrochemical Properties Li}Mn}O spinels undergo lithium insertion/extraction at either 4 V (8a sites) or 3 V ("lling additional lithium sites) vs Li/Li` couple. The former reaction is limited by the manganese valence l(Mn), which cannot exceed 4. The latter is usually considered less interesting for applications, because it corresponds to a lower l(Mn) range (between 3 and 3.5 when starting from LiMn2O4), where extensive Jahn}Teller distortion occurs. This phenomenon is an intrinsic property of the Mn3` ion (t32'e1' electronic con"guration) and is very deleterious to reversibility of intercalation reactions (1). The electrochemical interest of cation-vacant Li}Mn}O spinels is two-fold: (i) they have l(Mn) close to #4, and can be expected to intercalate lithium (3 V reaction) while staying away from the Jahn}Teller distorsion limit l(Mn)"3.5, unlike LiMn2O4; (ii) an extra intercalation capacity is expected to occur because of lithium vacancies, and might show up as distinct steps in charge}discharge curves. In addition, since samples A, B, and C have a fraction of vacant tetrahedral 8a sites, a signi"cant initial lithium intercalation capacity is expected to occur at 4 V vs Li/Li`. A comparison of "rst discharges (Fig. 7) shows that this high-potential capacity fraction is observed only on sample C, which is actually prepared in situ by a preliminary charge 114 PALOS, ANNE, AND STROBEL FIG. 8. Slow step scanning voltammetry of samples A2, B, and P at 10 mV/h. FIG. 9. Galvanostatic cycling of sample B at C/20 rate (top); corresponding incremental capacity curve (bottom). Twenty cycles are shown. (delithiation). Sample B has a fairly high initial potential (3.92$0.05 V), but this decreases rapidly at the beginning of discharge and the capacity above 3.5 V is (0.05 Li per spinel formula unit, i.e., much less than expected for a compound containing 0.38 tetrahedral vacancies. Sample A2 behaves like a normal, nonde"cient spinel with an initial potential of ca. 3.2 V and an immediate drop to the voltage plateau at 2.9 V on discharge. A similar behavior was observed by de Kock et al. on &&Li2Mn4O9'' (4). Details of the "rst electrochemical cycle were studied by slow-scanning voltammetry (10 mV/h), as shown in Fig. 8, where stoichiometric LiMn2O4 is included as a reference. It shows clear characteristics of a two-phase system in all cases (common origin of reduction and oxidation peaks (20)). Compounds A2, B, and P have a similar equilibrium potential for this two-phase redox reaction, obtained by interpolation between reduction and oxidation peak onsets. Its value is slightly lower than that of LiMn2O4 (2.90 and 2.96 V, respectively). These voltammograms also reveal a particular feature of sample B: the presence of a separate redox step occurring ca. 200 mV above the main charge/discharge step (see asterisks in Fig. 8). This result is remarkable in several ways: (i) this feature is observed neither on the parent stoichiometric compound P, nor on the electrochemically delithiated sample C; (ii) it is reversible and remains stable on cycling, as shown in Fig. 9b, which displays 20 charge}discharge cycles on this material. The associated capacity is +0.20 Li per formula, i.e., equal to the B site lithium fraction in sample B. Given the fact that B gives the sharpest X-ray re#ections among cation-de"cient samples, a possible explanation for this is B site Li/Mn ordering. Intercalation sites surrounded by Li-occupied B sites would give rise to lower electrostatic repulsion, and consequently to a preferential occupation by intercalated cations occuring at a lower reducing potential than sites adjacent to Mn3`@4` cations. However, given the low scattering power of lithium, no experimental con"rmation of such an ordering could be found. Another possible explanation for this extra step, the formation of a fraction of ramsdellite-type MnO2 as a result of the acid treatment (21), can be ruled out on the basis of X rays and neutron data. Galvanostatic cyclings at +C/10 rate show that samples A2 and B are both very stable on cycling in the potential window 2.0}3.6 V (see Figs. 9 and 10). The di!erential capacity curves illustrate the main di!erences between these two intercalation hosts: a #atter voltage plateau, i.e., sharper current peaks for A2, and the additional step starting at 3.10 V for B. Initial capacities are slightly higher for the 115 CATION-DEFICIENT Li}Mn}O SPINELS FIG. 10. Same as Fig. 8 for sample A2 at C/10 rate. FIG. 11. Evolution of the 3-V capacity on cycling at +C/10: cell 54"stoichiometric LiMn2O4, cell 55"sample B (tetrahedral-vacancy spinel), cell 56"sample A2 (double-vacancy spinel). latter, as expected from its higher initial manganese oxidation state. Figure 11 shows that their performances level out after ca. 30 cycles, and that both cation-vacant spinels are much more stable than stoichiometric LiMn2O4. The double-vacancy sample A2 is especially stable, and maintains a capacity of 0.5 Li, corresponding to 80 mAh/g, at the 85th cycle. We note that this capacity 0.5 Li corresponds to a lower limit of manganese oxidation state equal to #3.5, i.e., the limiting Mn3` fraction above which a cooperative Jahn}Teller occurs, leading to a structural distortion (1). Analysis of A2 and B electrochemical cells stopped after cycling indeed did not reveal any signi"cant tetragonal distortion in these materials. Average cell parameters obtained on oxide samples from cells stopped in discharged state yielded 8.183 and 8.171 A_ for samples A2 and B, respectively. The remarkably small volume change in the A2 case (*a"0.004 A_ ) may be a major factor in the superior stability of this material after more than 80 charge}discharge cycles. In a slightly wider potential window, high cycling capacities were also reported up to the 30th cycle for Li4Mn5O12-like samples prepared from lithium peroxide at 4003C (7). Our results con"rm the superior stability of such vacancy-containing Li}Mn}O spinels with high initial manganese valence and partial disorder as shown by the large linewidth of X-ray and neutron re#ections. 4. CONCLUSIONS This study allowed us to con"rm the double-vacancy scheme for Li}Mn}O spinels prepared by low-temperature solid state reaction. It also showed remarkable di!erences between spinel-type compounds with compositions close to Li2Mn4O9, depending on the distribution of cationic vacancies and inclusion of protons in the lattice. This di!erence also shows in their electrochemical behavior in lithium batteries: whereas the capacity associated with vacancy "lling is barely noticeable in the double-vacancy compound A2, an extra lithium insertion/extraction step is clearly visible in sample B obtained by room-temperature chemical delithiation. Both compounds are much more stable than stoichiometric LiMn2O4 on cycling in the 3 V region; however, the main advantage of these materials in terms of electrochemical stability does not directly result from lithium intercalation into cation vacancies, but rather from their higher initial manganese oxidation state and exceptionally small cell expansion in the case of the doublevacancy spinel B.

Due to the presence of these redox couples in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.1), Ru doped compositions show (i) change in structure (ii) large decrease in impedance(~ 107 to ~ 105 Ohm) (iii) degrade methyl orange and methylene blue solution (pH-6) in quick time in presence of tungsten (W) bulb and sun light. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction studies show the change in lattice parameters with Ru doping at Mn site in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.1). Raman and Infrared spectroscopic studies show the shift in Mn–O stretching mode of ­Li2MnO3 towards lower wave number with Ru doping. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies show the presence of mixed valences of ­Mn+3, ­Mn+4, ­Ru+4 and ­Ru+5 in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.1) using ­L2,3 and ­M4 edge. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies show the optical band gap in visible light range in Ru doped ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.1) compositions. The presence of 5 mg of ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 degrades 5 ml of methyl orange solution (10 mg/L) of pH 6 in 5 min and methylene blue solution (10 mg/L) of pH 6 in 3 min of exposure in W bulb light. Keywords Synchrotron X-ray · XAS · Raman · Dye degradation · Optical absorption 1 Introduction Manganese (Mn) containing oxides crystallize in layered, perovskite, spinel, and various other structures, where valence state of Mn make these oxides vulnerable for various technological applications [1–7]. Colossal magnetoresistance, room temperature magnetism, metal to insulator transition, catalytic and Li intercalation are some of the properties which are utilized in devices [1, 2, 5, 6]. Mixed valence states of Mn play a major role in altering the properties of the materials as per the technological application need [2, 6, 7]. In perovskite oxides, ratio of Mn mixed valence ­Mn+3/Mn+4 decides the structural, magnetic and transport properties. ­Mn+3 containing oxides show insulating and antiferromagnetic behaviour while ­Mn+4 containing oxides also show insulating and antiferromagnetic properties [2, 6]. When ­Mn+3 remains present 67% and ­Mn+4 33% then perovskite oxides show metallic and ferromagnetic behaviour. Presence of 50% ­Mn+3 and 50% ­Mn+4 valence states makes spinel oxides susceptible for charging and discharging in Li ion battery [1, 4, 7]. Hierarchical microstructure of ­Mn3O4 has been tried for degradation of methylene blue [8]. ­MnO2, which has +4 valence state of Mn, has been considered as a photocatalyst and known for its cost effectiveness, adsorption/ oxidizing abilities, large specific surface area and nontoxic nature [9]. It has been observed that some of the good photocatalysts involve metal cations ­Fe+2 in photo-fanton process for degradation of MB, where redox interaction between ­Fe+2 and ­Fe+3 play an important role to produce hydroxyl ions [10]. Ru is a 4 d transition metal and placed in same group with iron in periodic table. Ru-Mn interaction * Brajendra Singh, brajendr@gmail.com; brajendr@allduniv.ac.in; Priyanka Singh, priyankauoa@gmail.com | 1Materials Chemistry Lab, Centre of Material Sciences, University of Allahabad, Allahabad 211002, India. Vol:.(1234567890) Research Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:506 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2260-z induces mixed valence ­Ru+4/Ru+5 with ­Mn+3/Mn+4 in perovskite oxides and spinel structures [11–14]. When ­Ru+4 (0.62 Å) is interact with ­Mn+4 (0.53 Å), it undergo redox reaction which leads to ­Mn+3 (0.645 Å) and ­Ru+5 (0.565 Å) valence states as redox potential of ­Ru+4/Ru+5 (1.07 eV) is comparable with that of ­Mn+3/Mn+4 (1.02 eV) [15]. ­Ru+4/ Ru+5 redox couple operates at 4.3 V vs Li in the spinel ­LiMn2O4 and increases the cycling capacity of Li ion battery [12]. Ru doping brings cycling stability due to the presence of ­Ru+4/Ru+5 redox couple in ­Li2Mn(Ru)O3 rock salt type layered structure [16–19]. Presence of mixed valence ­Ru+4/Ru+5 with ­Mn+3/Mn+4 brings long range of magnetic ordering in ­La0.7Ca0.3Mn1−xRuxO3 thin films [14]. ­Ru+4 containing thin film of ­La0.7Ca0.3Mn0.7Ru0.3O3 shows colossal magnetoimpedance effects at room temperature [20]. Ru exists in its single valence state ­Ru+4 in ­LaMn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.1,0.2,0.3, 0.4) compositions and it shows band gad in the range of ~ 1.27 eV to 1.36 eV [21]. ­LaMn1−xRuxO3 compounds degrade MO solution (pH 2.5) and generate photocatalytic oxygen by water in W bulb light [21]. In this study, we have documented the doping effect of ­Ru+4 at ­Mn+4 site in ­Li2MnO3 on the structure, Mn and Ru valence states, and dye degradation properties using methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) at nominal pH 6. 2 Experimental Polycrystalline ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1) samples were prepared using high temperature solid state reaction route. In the preparation process, we have weighed the stoichiometric amount of high purity LiOH.H2O, ­MnO2 and ­RuO2. They were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and heated at 950 °C for 12 h in an ambient atmosphere in muffle furnace. ­Sr4Ru2O9 sample was prepared by taking stoichiometric amount of high purity ­SrCO3 and ­RuO2 oxides. The precursors were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and calcined at 850 °C for 36 h in oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered under oxygen atmosphere at 950 °C for 36 h in tubular furnace. ­LiMn2O4 sample was prepared by taking stoichiometric amount of high purity LiOH.H2O and ­MnO2. The precursors were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and heated at 800 °C for 24 h. ­LaMn0.8Ru0.2O3 sample was prepared by taking stoichiometric amount of high purity ­La2O3, ­MnO2 and ­RuO2 oxides. The precursors were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and calcined at 900 °C for 24 h and subsequently sintered at 1050 °C for 24 h in ambient atmosphere. Heating rate was maintained 5 °C/min during heating and cooling. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns (step size 0.015, scan speed 1 s/step) using synchrotron radiation (λ = 1.09 Å) were recorded at room temperature at Indian beamline BL-18B, Photon Factory (PF), KEK, Tsukuba, Japan. The incoming X-ray beam from the bending magnet of the PF storage ring was collimated with a set of beam-defining slits having vertical opening of 0.2 mm and 2 mm in the horizontal direction. The sample was mounted onto an 8-circle goniometer (Huber, Germany) at the focal point of the focusing mirror of the beamline. A slit of 1.5 mm (horizontal) by 0.25 mm (vertical) was mounted just before the detector to increase the signal-to-background ratio. Raman spectra of these powder samples were recorded using Renishaw micro-Raman spectrometer (model RM-2000) and focused ­Ar+ laser beam of 514-nm using Leica microscope. The incident laser power was attenuated to 2 mW, and data acquisition time was set to 50 s for all the samples was used to record the data. The Raman spectra were recorded using Peltier air-cooled CCD detector in the range of 100–3200 cm−1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (absorbance vs. wavenumber) of the samples were recorded using a FTIR Perkin Elmer spectrometer, using the KBr pellet technique from 400 to 4000 cm−1 at room temperature. Each IR scan recorded after averaging of 25 scans. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements for Mn ­L2,3, and Ru ­M4,5 were performed at the Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS) beamline (BL-01) of the INDUS 2 synchrotron source source (2.5 GeV, 300 mA) at Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore, India. This beamline is operating in the energy range 100-1200 eV. Sample pellets were mounted in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of ­10−10 Torr. SXAS data were collected in total electron yield (TEY) mode at room temperature under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Impedance and capacitance measurements were recorded using novacontrol make Impedance analyzer (Alpha-A high performance frequency analyzer) in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 40 MHz in ambient atmosphere at room temperature. We had used 10.4 mm diameter and 1.2 mm thick pellets polished both side with silver paste for these measurements. The wire length was ~ 2 feet between the impedance analyzer and sample. The reflectance of the ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1) solid samples were recorded using UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer over a wavelength range of 200–800 nm. ­BaSO4 was used as an internal reflectance standard. The absorbance of the Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MB) solution was measured in wavelength range of 200–800 nm to find out the degradation. To find out the band gap of these samples, the diffuse reflectance data were converted to the Kubelka–Munk function by equation [22]: F(R) = (1 −R)2∕2R Vol.:(0123456789) SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:506 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2260-z Research Article where R is reflectance, F (R) is proportional to extinction coefficient α. Band gaps were determined by Tauc plots using equation [23]: where υ is frequency, A is absorption constant, h is Planck constant and ­Eg is band gap. Here, n denotes the nature of band gap. For indirect band gap n = 2 and direct band gap n = 1/2 is used. To understand the dye degradation ability of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.0 and 0.1), we have selected methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) dyes for degradation. ­MnO2 has been used as reference for MO and MB degradation. The photocatalytic degradation of aqueous methyl orange and methylene blue dyes by ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3, and ­MnO2, was carried out in a borosil make glass sample vials. Sample vial further placed in ultrasonicator and exposed in visible light of 200 Watt incandescent tungsten (W) bulb (300 to 900 nm) under constant flow of water (to maintain the constant temperature). MO and MB stock solutions of 10 mg/L concentration were prepared in ultra pure water. Hydrochloric acid was used to maintain pH of dye solutions. For dye degradation experiment, we have used 5 mg of catalyst in 5 ml dye solutions of 10 mg/L concentration for all the compositions. Before mixing catalysts in dye solutions, the pH of dye solutions was maintained 6. Ultrasonicator was used for proper mixing of catalyst and dye solution during exposing the mixture in visible light. The distance between 200 W incandescent tungsten(W) bulb and sample vial was maintained 15 cm. Visible part of sample vials (4 cm length and 1.6 cm diameter) was effectively exposed to 70.77 mW/cm2 power of radiation. The samples were filtered using whatmann filter paper after exposing in W bulb light and absorbance of dye solutions were recorded in a Shimadzo make UV–Visible spectrometer over a wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The concentration of MB were calculated as ­Ct = C0(At/A0), [훼h휐]1∕n = A [h휐−Eg] where ­C0 initial MB concentration, ­A0—initial absorbance (at λ = 662 nm), ­Ct—MB concentration at time t, and ­At—absorbance (at maxima of peak on t minute), respectively.The degradation rate % was calculated by [(A0 − At)/ A0] × 100. 3 Results and discussion Li2MnO3 crystallizes in monoclinic unit cell and space group C2/m (Fig. 1). It is a layered structure, where a layer of Li ions, and a mixed layer of Li and 2Mn ions are alternating between closed packed oxygen layers. In a crystal, Li ions occupy three positions (2b, 2c and 4 h), oxygen ions occupy two positions (4i and 8j) and Mn atom occupies one position (4g) [24, 25]. In ­MnO6 octahedra, two types of Mn–O bonds of 1.90 Å and 1.91 Å exists [24, 25]. Figure 2 shows the synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions from 10 degree to 70 degree. We have found stoichiometric single phase for ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions and diffraction patterns matches with the reference code ICSD-202639 and JCPDS-01-084-1634 patterns. All the peaks are matching with the reported results in literature. Parent and Ru doped diffraction patterns show the characteristic peaks (020), (110), (021) and (110) which confirms the crystallization of these compositions in C2/m. Figure 3 shows the close look of the peaks of normalized intensity for all the compositions. It has been observed that the peaks (001), (020), (110), (130) shifts at lower theta with the increase in Ru concentration. Shifting of peaks shows the expansion of unit cell with Ru substitution due to the higher ionic size of ­Ru+4 (0.76Å) than the ionic size of ­Mn+4 (0.67Å). Peaks (202) and (131) merge together with Ru substitution at Mn site. Peak ( ̄3 31) shifted towards lower theta value for Ru = 0.05 composition but for Ru-0.1 composition ( ̄331) peak split into ( ̄331) and (060). Crystallite size for all the composition has been calculated using Debye Sherrer formula (Crystallite Fig. 1 a Crystal structure of monoclinic ­Li2MnO3. b Shaded atoms (six O and one Mn atoms) show the configuration of Mn–O6 octahedra in ­Li2MnO3 Vol:.(1234567890) Research Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:506 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2260-z size (Å) = 0.9 λ/d cosθ). Ru doping decreases crystallite size of materials. Table 1 summarizes the results of the analysis of synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns. These results show that Ru has been successfully doped at Mn site in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1]. To explore the shifting of peaks at lower theta value and lowering of crystallite size at micro level by Ru doping at Mn site, we have recorded the Raman spectra of these compositions [12, 26]. Figure 4 shows the Raman peaks for powder samples of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions. Theoretical calculations predict the 15 Raman active optical modes, in which 7 modes are ­Ag and 8 modes are ­Bg [27]. In monoclinic space group C2/m, ­Ag modes are generated from the symmetric vibrations of cations along b-axis. ­Bg modes are generated from the symmetric vibrations of cations along a and c-axis. The vibrations of octahedrally coordinated Mn atom at 4 g position results 1 ­Ag and ­2Bg modes, while 1 ­Ag and ­2Bg modes are due to Li atom at 4 h site. O atom at 4i position generates ­2Ag and ­1Bg modes, and remaining 3 ­Ag and ­3Bg modes can be assigned to vibrations of O atom at 8j site [28, 29]. We have clearly observed 14 active Raman modes in our synthesized ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 samples while other groups have reported only 8 Raman peaks in monoclinic ­Li2MnO3 samples [28, 29]. The observed Raman Peaks positions are summarized in Table 2 for ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions. Ru substitution at Mn site shifts ­Ag peak at ~ 615 cm−1 of ­Li2MnO3 to lower value ~ 610.8 cm−1 for x = 0.05 composition. This observation is similar to the Ru doped ­LiMn2O4 samples where we had observed the peak shifting towards lower wave numbers [12]. Ru as a 4d transition metal having extended orbitals and higher spin orbit coupling constant 800 cm−1 in comparison with 100 cm−1 of Mn. It makes Ru–O bond stronger than Mn–O bond which reflect in shifting of ­Ag vibrational peak towards lower wave numbers. For Ru = 0.1 composition, we have observed that Raman peaks splitted into multiple peaks for stretching modes of Mn–O vibrations, it shows that the multiple cations vibration contributing to stretching modes. Figure 5 shows the Infra red (IR) peaks for powder samples of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.1] compositions. Theoretical calculations predict the 7 ­Au and 11 ­Bu IR active optical modes [27]. We have found 7 peaks for ­Li2MnO3 which are similar with the reported experimental studies in literature [30]. In ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3, some Raman peaks merge and total 5 peaks have been observed. All the peaks have been sihifted towards lower wavenumber with the doping of Ru at Mn site. Presence of multiple peaks and shift of other vibrational peaks in Raman and IR spectra motivated us to find the valence states of transition metals Mn and Ru in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1] compositions. In Figure 6a, we show Mn­L2,3 absorption edge spectra of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] and ­Li2Mn2O4 systems together with that of ­Mn2O3, ­MnO2 (where Mn exist in +3 and +4 valence states) for comparison. The ­L2 edge and ­L3 edge correspond to the ­2p1/2 − 3d ­(t2g and ­eg orbitals) and ­2p3/2 − 3d ­(t2g and ­eg orbitals) transitions, respectively. Cathode material ­LiMn2O4 is known for showing 50–50% of ­Mn+3 and ­Mn+4 valence states [12]. In ­L3 absorption edge, We have observed two peaks at 642.30 eV and 643.39 eV in ­LiMn2O4 which are identical to peaks at 642.37 in ­Mn2O3 and 643.45 eV in ­MnO2 [31]. It shows the presence of ­Mn+3 and ­Mn+4 valence states in ­Li2Mn2O4 [31]. In ­Li2MnO3 (x = 0.0), we have found peak at 643.45 eV which is comparable to peak observed in ­MnO2, it shows the presence of ­Mn+4 valence state in ­Li2MnO3. Figure 6b shows the close look of ­L3 edge for ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1]. In ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 (x = 0.05), we have observed peaks at 643.35 eV and in ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 (x = 0.1) we have found peaks at 643.25 eV. These peaks are shifting towards lower energy as Ru concentration is increasing. It confirms the presence of ­Mn+3 valence state along with ­Mn+4 in ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 and ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3. In Figure 7a, we show Ru – ­M4 absorption edge spectra of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1] and ­LaMn0.8Ru0.2O3 systems together with that of ­RuO2 and ­Sr4Ru2O9, where Ru exist in +4 and +5 valence states [11, 15, 32, 33]. The ­M4 Fig. 2 Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1). Ru doped compositions show the single phase as ­Li2MnO3.

The ­M4 edge of ­RuO2 has been found at 287.95 eV which is similar with the reported by zhou et al. [33]. Zhou et al. have found ­M4 edge of Ru at 288 eV in ­RuO2 nano particles [33]. The ­M4 absorption edge has been found at 289.74 eV for ­Sr4Ru2O9, which is 1.78 eV more than ­M4 edge peak of ­RuO2. This result shows the presence of +5 valence state of Ru in ­Sr4Ru2O9. These results are similar with findings of Hu et al. [32] where they have shown that Ru remains in +4 and +5 valence states for ­RuO2 and ­Sr4Ru2O9 respectively [32, 34]. In our observation, ­LaMn0.8Ru0.2O3 has been found showing ­M4 absorption peak of Ru at 288.05 eV which is very close to the absorption peak (at 287.95 eV) of ­RuO2 [33]. This result is very much similar with the reported result by patra et al., where it has been found that Ru remains in +4 valence state in ­LaMn0.8Ru0.2O3 [21]. In ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 (x = 0.05), we have Fig. 3 Zoomed peaks of synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1). Shifting of peaks towards lower theta value shows the expansion of lattice with Ru substitution at Mn in ­Li2MnO3 Vol:.(1234567890) Research Article SN Applied Sciences (2020) 2:506 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-2260-z observed multiple peaks at 288.15 and 289.88 eV and similarly in (x = 0.1) two peaks at 288.02 and 289.88 eV have been observed. These two absorption peaks are similar with the ­M4 absorption peak of ­RuO2 and ­Sr4Ru2O9. These results show that ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 and ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 contain multi valence states of Ru ­(Ru+4 and ­Ru+5). Fitting of ­M4 absorption peak of Ru shows the % amount of Ru valence state in ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 and ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 (Fig. 7b). ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 compound contains 48% ­Ru+4 valence state and 52% ­Ru+5 valence state. ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 compound contains 32% ­Ru+4 valence state and 68% ­Ru+5 valence state. To see the effect of multivalence states of Ru and Mn in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1] on the transport properties of ­Li2MnO3, we have measured the frequency dependent impedance measurements. Figure 8 shows the impedance and capacitance for these compositions in the frequency range ­103 to 4 × 107 ­cm−1. At frequency ­103 Hertz, x = 0.0 composition show 1.38 × 107 Ohm impedance while x = 0.05 and 0.1 show 2.82 × 105 and 5.37 × 104 Ohm respectively. Capacitance is found 1.05 × 10−11 F at frequency ­103 Hertz for x = 0.0 composition while x = 0.05 and 0.1 compositions show 5.15 × 10−10 F and 2.71 × 10−9 F respectively. These measurements show the decrease in impedance and increase in capacitance with the substitution of Ru in ­Li2MnO3. On increasing frequency, impedance further decreases for all the compositions. These observations confirm the presence of ­Mn+3 valence state along with ­Mn+4 valence state in Ru doped compositions. While synthesis of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions, we have observed that parent x = 0.0 composition is in reddish colour and Ru doped compositions x = 0.05 and 0.1 are in black colour.

Figure 9 shows the reflectance of the ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions. ­TiO2 (commercial sample) is used as reference for reflectance. Optical reflectance spectra of ­Li2MnO3 showed a sharp edge at 610 to 750 nm, which is similar with the reported by Tamilarasan et al. [35]. The peaks ~ 610 nm corresponds to a HOMO–LUMO gap between filled O(2p) states and empty Mn(IV) (3d–4 s) states. Figure 10 shows the band gap of the ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions, which was calculated using Kubelka–Munk function and Tauc plot [22, 23]. Tauc plot gave an energy band gap 2.17 eV for parent ­Li2MnO3 which is in agreement with the theoretical estimations [35, 36]. In Ru doped compositions, we have observed some more reflectance peaks near to 480 nm and 577 nm. Band gap calculation suggests the presence of multiple absorption of band gap 1.97, 2.15, 2.33 and 2.41 eV for x = 0.1 composition and band gap 1.91, 2.09 and 2.24 eV for x = 0.05 composition. These experimental determined optical band gaps are reported by theoretical studies on the systems which have Mn mixed valences. The optical absorption in Mn containing systems is controlled by electric dipole matrix elements that preserve spins of electrons. Features observed in optical conductivity close to 1 eV, 3 eV have been ascribed due to the d–d charge transfer between Mn ions on different sites, ­eg−eg transitions in perovskite manganite systems [37–39]. These band gap values 1.91, 2.09 and 2.24 eV for x = 0.05 composition and band gap 1.97, 2.15, 2.33 and 2.41 eV for x = 0.1 composition suggest the optical activity of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1] compositions in visible light. Ranjeh et al. have investigated photocatalytic properties of ­Li2MnO3 bulk and nano particles using aqueous solution via visible light for degradation of dyes acid red88 and malachite green [40]. Acid red dye degradation was found 17.6% by bulk ­Li2MnO3 and 40.9% by nano ­Li2MnO3. They have shown following mechanism of degradation using ­Li2MnO3: [40] Li2MnO3 + h휐→(Li2MnO3 ) ∗+e−+ h+ O2 + e−→O− 2 O− 2 + 2H+→H2O2 OH−+ h+→⋅OH H2O + h+→⋅OH + H+ Dyes + (O− 2 ∕⋅OH ∕H2O2 )→Degraded water pollutant Fig. 6 a XAS spectra of ­L2,3 edge for ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] and ­LiMn2O4.

These cations make positive surface of ­Li2MnO3 and prevent electron–hole recombination which help generation of.OH on the ­Li2MnO3 surface [40]. We have selected two different type of dyes, (i) A cationic dye, Methylene Blue (MB) and (ii) an azo dye methyl orange (MO) for degradation capabilities of ­Li2MnO3 and its Ru doped compositions. MB is used for printing, leather and in dyeing cotton and, causes various harmful effects such as eye burns, irritation to the skin and gastrointestinal tract [41]. MB is also regarded as significant threat due to its carcinogenic and mutagenic properties [42]. MB containing waste water from industry is essentially needed an efficient treatment technology which give ultimately clean water for safe disposal quickly. Methyl orange is used as an indicator for acid base titration. In Figure 11, we have plotted the absorption in the wavelength range 200–800 nm of (i) as prepared MO solution (ii) pH controlled (pH = 6) MO solution and (iii) MO solution of pH6 mixed with ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 composition exposed up to 5 min in visible light. Methyl orange absorbs UV–vis light at ~ 270 nm and ~ 465 nm which corresponds to n-π* transition. MO solution shows absorption peak ~ 465 nm which shifts to ~ 507 nm after adjusting the pH 6 of the MO solution. After 5 min of ultrasonication and exposure in visible light, MO solution with pH 6 is degraded and no peaks at ~ 465 and ~ 507 nm is visible. ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 composition degrades MO solution 100% in 5 min in the presence of nominal pH6. As prepared MO solution show no degradation either in sunlight or with ultrasonication (Table 3). In Figure 12, we have plotted the absorption of the MB solution mixed with ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 composition varied time (b) 1 min (c) 2 min (d) 3 min exposure in visible light. Methylene blue show absorption band at high energy due to π-π* transition of benzene ring while low energy band ~ 660–670 nm corresponds to n–π* transitions (where n is the free doublet on the nitrogen atom of C=N bond and free doublet of S atom on S=C bond). Insets show the zoomed plot in the wavelength range 400 to 800 nm for corresponding time exposure in visible light. After 1 min of exposure in visible light, MB peak (λ = 663 nm) shifts to 619 nm and absorption is very much decreased. After 3 min exposure of visible light, MB is degraded. As prepared MB solution shows no degradation with ultrasonication (Table 4). We have also recorded the degradation using MB solutions (pH6) exposed in Tungston bulb light for 60 min each with (b) ­Li2MnO3, where Mn is present in +4 valence state (c) ­LiMn2O4, where Mn is present in +3 and +4 valence states and (d) ­MnO2, where Mn is present in +4 valence state. We have found that there is no substantial degradation of MB solution with ­Li2MnO3 and ­LiMn2O4 while ­MnO2 degrades partially in 60 min. In Figure 13, we show the efficiency for MB in presence of (i) ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3, where Mn is present in mixed valence Fig. 7 a XAS spectra of ­M4 edge for ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1].

Synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy measurements show the change in structure with the doping of Ru at Mn site in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1]. XRD studies show the change in lattice which suggest the presence of Ru with Mn in the lattice of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1] systems. XAS studies show the presence of ­Ru+4/Ru+5 and ­Mn+3/Mn+4 redox couples in Ru doped materials. When ­Ru+4 doped at ­Mn+4 site, due to comparable redox potential of ­Ru+4/Ru+5 (1.07 eV) with that of ­Mn+3/Mn+4 (1.02 eV), ­Ru+4 (0.62 Å) converts into ­Ru+5 (0.565 Å) and for charge valence same amount of ­Mn+4 (0.53 Å) converts into ­Mn+3 (0.645 Å) [11, 15]. When ­Ru+4 doped at ­Mn+3 site in ­LaMnO3 then mixed valence is not observed as shown in Fig. 7 and it also show by patra et al. [21]. It has been shown earlier that ­Mn+3(0.645 Å) (in octahedral coordinated configuration) has comparatively bigger radius than ­Mn+4 (0.53 Å) and it has an electron in ­eg orbital. Due to one ­eg electron, ­Mn+3–O6 octahedral elongate in z axis direction and it brings distortion in lattice. Although, the presence of ­Ru+5 (0.565 Å) make up charge balance but due to size mismatch with ­Mn+3 (0.645 Å) could not stop distortion in lattice of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1]. Raman and IR spectroscopic studies show the evidence of lattice distortion by changing the peak position and splitting in Ru doped compositions. Impedance has been observed ­102 times less in ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 in comparison to that of ­Li2MnO3 due to the bigger d orbitals of Ru in comparison to Mn and mixed valences ­Ru+4/Ru+5 and ­Mn+3/Mn+4. Electrons can easily hope in Ru assisted invironment in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 in comparison to ­Li2MnO3. ­Mn+3 contains 3 electrons in ­t2g orbitals while 1 electron in ­eg orbitals while ­Mn+4 contains only 3 electrons in ­t2g orbitals. ­Ru+4 contains 2 paired and 2 unpaired electrons in ­t2g orbitals while ­Ru+5 contains only 3 electrons in ­t2g orbitals. One ­eg electron of ­Mn+3 can hope to vacant ­eg orbitals ­Mn+4 and ­Ru+5 in Ru doped ­Li2MnO3 compositions. One ­eg electron of ­Mn+3 and presence of 4d orbitals containing Ru modify the impedance and capacitance properties of Ru doped ­Li2MnO3 compositions.

Band gap increases with the increase of Ru content while crystallite size decreased. In the crystalline environment of Ru and Mn in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1], Mn intersite and Ru intersite transitions using ­eg − eg, ­t2g − eg may become allowed by spin orbit coupling, lattice disorder/distortions and mixing of odd parity wave functions. Decreases in crystallite size of the compositions, Mn–Mn intersite, Ru-Mn intersite and spin orbit coupling are the main cause of enhanced band gap of ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 and ­Li2Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 in comparison to ­Li2MnO3. Presence of mixed valences ­Ru+4/Ru+5 and ­Mn+3/Mn+4 assist the process of degradation of MO and MB solutions with faster rate in comparison with ­MnO2. Compounds ­LaMn1−xRuxO3 degrades MO dye only at pH 2.5 and takes 15 min [21]. ­LaMn1−xRuxO3 shows the presence of only ­Mn+3 and ­Ru+4 valence states. Our results show the presence of redox couples ­Mn+3–Mn+4 and ­Ru+4–Ru+5 valence states in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1,]. Multiple valence states enhance the process of degradation of 5 ml each of MO and MB dyes in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1,]. 5 mg of Fig. 10 Band gap calculations using UV–vis (DRS) spectra for a F(R) for all the compositions b x = 0.0, c x = 0.05 d x = 0.1 in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1] compositions Fig. 11 Absorbance spectra of the Methyl Orange solutions after reaction with ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 in the given exposure time of W bulb light.

Possible degradation mechanism can be summarised by following reactions as shown by Ranjeh et al.: Presence of multiple valence states ­Mn+3/Mn+4 and ­Ru+4/Ru+5 create photo generated electrons and holes by transferring electrons from valence band to conduction band leaving holes in valence band. Electrons react with ­O2 and generate ­O2 −. O2 − further reacts with ­H+ ions and generates ­H2O2. Holes react with ­OH− and generate ­OH• free radicals. So ­(O2 −/.OH/H2O2) react with MO, MB dyes solution and decolourize. If ­H+ ions are not present then these compounds does not degrade MO and MB dyes. In presence of ­H+ and visible light, ­Li2MnO3 does not degrade MO and MB dyes up to 24 h. ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1] degrades MO and MB dyes very fast in presence of ­H+ (pH 6) and W bulb/sunlight due to presence of mixed Methylene Blue∕Methyl Orange Dye + (O− 2 ∕.OH∕H2O2 ) →Degraded water pollutant valence states ­Mn+3/Mn+4 and ­Ru+4/Ru+5. These materials degrades MB dye very fast in compare to other Mn based ­systemsMn3O4, ­MnO2 and nano ­Li2MnO3 [8, 9, 43]. Easy material preparation of ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 and reusability of these materials is an advantage over other known ­TiO2 based catalysts. 4 Conclusions We have optimized the synthesis conditions for inducing the redox interaction between ­Ru+4 and ­Mn+4 which further results ­Mn+3–Mn+4 and ­Ru+4–Ru+5 valence states in ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 [x = 0.05, 0.1]. These redox couples in presence of ­H+ ions and W bulb/sunlight enhances the dye degradation process in Ru doped ­Li2MnO3. ­Li2Mn0.9Ru0.1O3 composition (i) shows ­102 times decreased impedance and (ii) quickly degrades methyl orange and methylene blue solutions at pH 6 which shows its capability as effective dye degradation material which otherwise was neither found in other Mn based systems nor in these types of monoclinic crystals. These Ru doped ­Li2Mn1−xRuxO3 materials can be use for fast decomposition of other organic dyes which are harmful for environment. Fast degradation of dyes, easy material preparation and reusability can make these materials first choice in industry over other known ­TiO2 based catalysts.

Prakasha,bc Mridula Dixit Bharadwaja and Annigere S. Prakash *c Oxygen removal from high capacity Li-rich layered oxide Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2 affects the charge transfer process during cycling. During de-lithiation, oxygen removal takes place with the reduction in oxygen binding energy. Co substitution affects oxygen removal by shifting the O-p orbital closer to the Fermi energy. A convex hull plot is used to analyse single-phase and two-phase reactions during de-lithiation in Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2 and Li2MnO3. Experimentally, the single-phase and two-phase reactions are identified based on the characteristics of the charge curve. In the charge transfer process more than 80% of lithium charge is transferred to oxygen in both the compounds. Effective charge and cyclic voltammetry reveal the redox centers in the compounds which help to understand the role of oxygen and transition metals in de-lithiation. A detailed explanation of oxygen removal and the charge transfer mechanism of Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2 and Li2MnO3 is provided in the current experimental and density functional theory based study. In search of efficient cathode materials for high energy and power density requirements of electric vehicles (EV), Li-rich layered oxides are considered to be a feasible solution owing to their high specific capacity (B250 mA h g1).1–4 However, there are several challenges associated with the performance of these materials such as (i) high irreversible capacity loss with oxygen removal in the first charge,2 (ii) low discharge rate capability,5 (iii) capacity fade over cycles,5 (iv) low electronic conductivity,6,7 and (v) inevitable phase transformation from a layered to spinel phase during cycling,8 which undermine the commercial progress of the material. The origin of most of these challenges associates with the initial activation of the material, which needs further in-depth electronic level analysis. Although Density Functional Theory (DFT) based studies on Li-rich cathodes are reported in the literature they are limited to one or two 3d metals9–13 except for the study on Li1.2Ni0.13Fe0.13Mn0.54O2 by Laisa et al.14 Dianat et al.15 studied the electrochemical properties like structural stability, electrochemical potential and Li-ion diffusivity in Li[Li1/6Al1/6Mn1/2Ni1/6]O2. However, none of these studies addressed the electronic origin of the charge transfer process and oxygen removal in Li-rich cathodes involving Ni-Mn-Co. Among them, Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2 (LNMC) is considered one of the most promising cathode materials. In LNMC, the presence of Co increases the reversible capacity, but it suffers from O removal which may occur due to the overlap of the Co-d and O-p bands.16 To address this issue Xiao et al.17 have performed theoretical calculations on Li[Li1/3X2/3]O2 (X = Mn, Ni, Co, and Ti) and reported that the Co phase reduces the band gap which facilitates oxygen loss. However, such studies are to be extended to LNMC where the presence of multiple transition elements alters the electronic structure of the compounds and hence a systematic approach of first principles calculations together with experimental analysis is required. In the present study, first principles calculations based on DFT have been used to understand the electrochemical properties of Li-rich LNMC. The theoretical and experimental findings provide new physical insights into the electrochemical performance of LNMC, which is then compared with that of Li2MnO3 (LMO). In the proposed work, different phases are analysed with the help of a convex hull plot while charging. Electrochemical performance is analysed based on the following – (a) atomic arrangement in the metal layer, (b) stable phases attained on de-lithiation, (c) voltage profile, a Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), Bangalore 560094, India b Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR Madras Complex, Chennai 600113, India c CSIR Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Chennai Unit, Chennai 600113, India.

In the first step, a stoichiometric amount of transition metal acetates were dissolved in a mixed solution of ethanol and distilled water (volume ratio of water to ethanol was 2:1). Then a required amount of urea was added to the solution which serves as a carbonate source. The mixed solution was sealed in an autoclave and placed in an oven at 200 1C for 36 h followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The precipitate was washed several times with distilled water and then filtered and dried overnight at 80 1C. In the second step the as-prepared carbonate was mixed with stoichiometric lithium hydroxide and sintered at 800 1C for 12 h. The phase characterization of synthesized materials was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer equipped with a Cu Ka source (1l = 1.54056 Å, 2l = 1.54439 Å). Rietveld fits of individual diffraction patterns were carried out using the Fullprof suite program. The morphological features and elemental compositions of both the powder samples were analysed using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM MIRA3 LMU) equipped with Oxford X-Max20 energydispersive X-ray (EDX). The chemical valence of elements in the sample was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Multilab-2000 spectrometer fitted with non-monochromatic Al Ka radiation (1486.6 eV). Electrochemical studies were performed on Swagelok-type Li half-cells assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The positive electrodes were prepared by casting a mixture of 80 wt% of active materials, 15 wt% of Super-P Carbon (Timcal Belgium), and 5 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride using the N-methyl-2pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent on aluminum foil and dried overnight at 80 1C in a vacuum oven. A metallic lithium disc (Alfa Aesar) was used as a negative electrode. The electrolyte solution used was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate and the weight ratio of these carbonates was 1 : 1. A Whatman glass microfiber filter paper was used as a separator. The galvanostatic charge–discharge performance was measured between 2–4.8 V (versus Li) in galvanostatic mode using a VMP3Z (Biologic) multichannel potentiostat/ galvanostat. The typical cells contained around 4–6 mg cm2 cathode materials. DFT+U based first principles calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).19 Perdew– Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) type Generalized Gradient Approximations (GGA)20 were considered to approximate the exchange and correlation energy. In the simulation, a supercell of 2  1  1 was considered to reduce the influence under periodic boundary conditions. Further plane wave energy cutoff of 520 eV and k-mesh grids of 4  2  4 (Monkhorst–Pack21) were used. In the optimization process, on-site correlation of d-orbitals was incorporated to avoid delocalization using the Hubbard U parameter. The U-values for Mn (5.0), Ni (5.96) and Co (5.1) were used as reported by Xiao et al.17 For all the calculations, cell parameters and ionic positions were optimized till the force on each atom is o0.01 eV Å1. The partial intercalation potentials of studied phases were calculated using the Nernst equation.22 Oxygen binding energy in different compounds is a direct indication of oxygen stability. The binding energy is calculated from the energy obtained during the following reaction.17 Li2xMnxO3x Li2xMnxO3x1 + 1/2O2 (1) To calculate the binding energy, an oxygen vacancy concentration of 8.3% was considered for all the studied compositions. Weak bonding between metal and oxygen makes the removal of oxygen from the structure easy. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structure and morphology Fig. 1 shows the Rietveld refinement fitting of powder X-ray diffraction patterns of both LMO and LNMC samples.

Phys., 2018, 20, 19606--19613 This journal is ©the Owner Societies 2018 refinement of the LMO phase a monoclinic system with a C2/m space group is used whereas a two phase model (monoclinic system with a space group of C2/m and rhombohedral system with a space group of R%3m) was used for LNMC. The clear splitting of two peaks around 65–701 for both the samples suggests the well-ordered layered structure.23,24 The obtained crystallographic parameters are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Fig. 2a and b show FESEM images of the LMO and LNMC particles which are fused tightly into polycrystalline spherical agglomerates with sizes of 5–15 mm. 2.2 Optimization of ground state structure LMO has a layered structure similar to LiMO2 (M = Co, Mn, and Ni) with ABC oxygen stacking and additional Li in the Mn layer. In the structure, one additional Li ion per two Mn ions is positioned in the 2b Wyckoffsite and formed the LiM2 layer. The initial crystallographic information of LMO from the ICSD has been used for total energy calculations to optimize the ground state structure.25 The same crystallographic information has been used to construct the unit cell of LNMC, where two atoms of Mn and Li are replaced with Ni and Co atoms in the LiM2 layer. In LNMC, different atomic positions of Li, Co, Mn, and Ni in the LiM2 plane are considered to obtain the ground state structure similar to that of Li[Li1/6Al1/6Mn1/2Ni1/6]O2 reported by Dianat et al.,15 where they have taken Li[Li1/6Mn2/3Ni1/6]O2 as the base structure and all the transition elements are positioned in the LiM2 layer. In this study, similar approach has been adopted with an incorporation of Co in the LiM2 layer to generate different atomic configurations in the unit cell. Fig. 3 shows the highest and lowest formation energy (Ef) configurations of LNMC and these are referred as configuration 1 (Ef = 23.52 eV f.u.1) and configuration 2 (Ef = 23.45 eV f.u.1) respectively. In the configuration 1, both Ni and Li neighbour only with Mn and Co octahedra, whereas in configuration 2 the NiO6 octahedron neighbours with the Li, Co and Mn octahedra and LiO6 neighbours with the Ni, Co and Mn octahedra. A lower formation energy configuration (i.e. configuration 1) is considered further to evaluate the electrochemical properties. In the ESI† all other possible configurations have been given with their formation energies. 2.3 Phase analysis Stability of different de-lithiated structures have been analysed by using the convex hull plot shown in Fig. 4. In the figure, the relative energy per formula unit (E0) of most stable phases is connected ensuring that the curvature of the resulting arch always stays positive. For LMO, E0 at x = 2, 1.5, 1.25, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 compositions lie on the curvature (Fig. 4a) and these are considered as stable phases. Phases with x = 1.75 and 1 stay within 3 meV above the line, which is below the typical accuracy of DFT calculations.26 Therefore the phase can be considered as a stable phase. Although kinetic effects during cycling might prevent the phase to reach its lowest energy configuration, it would prefer to blend with the nearest neighbouring compositions of Fig. 2 FESEM images of (a) Li2MnO3 and (b) Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2 powder samples.

Phys., 2018, 20, 19606--19613 | 19609 the curvature. In the convex hull plot of LMO, an unstable phase is observed for x = 0.75 which stays above the line. In the case of LNMC, relative energy of stable phases for the lithium concentration of x = 1.2, 1, 0.5, and 0.17 lies on the convex hull line (Fig. 4b). The bending of the convex hull is observed at x = 0.5, therefore it is considered as the most stable phase of LNMC, whereas unstable phases at x = 0.85, 0.67, and 0.33 stay above the line which suggests that two-phase reactions would take place in the region of 1 o x o 0.5 and 0.5 o x o 0.17. Consequently, voltage plateaus are observed in these two regions. Further details of the voltage profile are discussed in the subsequent section. Based on the convex hull plot, a schematic of a lithium removal sequence is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen from the figure that lithium is initially removed from the lithium layer and then from both the layers of lithium and LiM2. A similar sequence of Li-removal has been observed during the charge transfer process for other Li-rich compounds as well based on DFT calculations.27 Although the sequence of Li-removal from specific sites is difficult to observe from experimental results, Mohanty et al.28 have reported that Li is removed first from the Li-layer, and then from both the layers of Li and LiM2 based on a change in c-lattice parameter with the help of in situ XRD analysis. Lithium removal from different layers affects the electrochemical potential and also the oxygen binding energy of the compound.27 2.4 Voltage profile In Fig. 6, a DFT calculated voltage profile along with experimental results of both the compounds have been compared. Voltage steps in the calculated profile correspond to each arc of the convex hull plot. For LMO, a nearly flat voltage (4.6 V) step has been observed till x = 1.25 composition (Fig. 6a) as a change in relative energy from one stable phase to another is negligible. Also in the experimental voltage profile of LMO, a flat plateau has been observed at 4.6 V during the initial de-lithiation process. Xiao et al. also reported a de-lithiation potential of 4.6 V for LMO based on DFT calculations.29 A current study has discussed electrochemical properties of LMO within a lithium concentration x = 2 to 1 considering deeper de-lithiation is practically difficult. For LNMC significant differences have been observed in the voltage profile (Fig. 6b). In Fig. 6b, the first voltage step appears at 4.04 V with a change in compositions of x = 1.17–1. This corresponds to a single phase reaction. Subsequent voltage steps appear at 4.23 and 4.42 V with a change in x = 1–0.5 and 0.5–0.17 respectively, where two phase reactions take place. Experimentally a steep slope is observed between 3.7–4.3 V and this corresponds to the oxidation of Ni2+/Ni4+ and Co3+/Co4+.30 A steep slope in this voltage range suggests a single phase reaction.31,32 The flat plateau beyond 4.4 V corresponds to two phase reactions. In this region, lithium removal from the transition metal layer is accompanied by complex reactions involving oxygen loss and structural rearrangement.33,34 2.5 Oxygen binding energy In Fig. 7, oxygen binding energy of different de-lithiated phases of LMO and LNMC is compared along with previously reported Fig. 4 Convex hull plot showing formation energy of different de-lithiated phases of (a) Li2MnO3 and (b) Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2. Fig. 5 Schematic showing the sequence of Li removal from the Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2 structure. Initial de-lithiation takes place from the lithium layer followed by the layers of LiM2 and metals instantaneously. Paper PCCP Published on 16 July 2018.

Phys., 2018, 20, 19606--19613 This journal is ©the Owner Societies 2018 Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.67O2 (LNMO).27 The binding energy is calculated for the stable phases as appeared in the convex hull plot. The oxygen binding energy of LMO at x = 1.75 is 0.7 eV, and it goes below 0 eV for further activation processes, whereas the binding energy increases in the Ni substituted material (LNMO). On the other hand, the energy will reduce with incorporation of Co in LNMC. The oxygen binding energy in the Co substituted compound with lithium concentration at x = 1 is 1.26 eV and for the next stable phase (where x = 0.5), it is 0.52 eV. The M–O bond dissociation energy (DHf) suggests that the Mn–O (DHf = 402 kJ mol1) and Ni–O (DHf = 391.6 kJ mol1) bonds are stronger than the Co–O bond (DHf = 368 kJ mol1).16 Therefore oxygen binding energy reduces with Co substitution in LNMC. Oxygen binding energy of both LMNO and LMNC (B0.53 eV) is nearly identical at deep de-lithiation state. In the subsequent section, the partial density of states (PDOS) of transition metals and oxygen has been analysed to understand the origin of oxygen evolution in the studied compositions. 2.6 Charge transfer To calculate lithium charge distribution, the Bader method has been used here. It helps to estimate the charge surrounding an atom x (Qx). The difference of Qx between lithiated and de-lithiated compound is used to calculate the lithium charge distribution on that atom x (Bx). Table 1 summarises lithium charge distribution of different atoms on the lithiated compound. For the charge distribution analysis of Li2MnO3, LiMnO3 is considered as a final de-lithiated compound. The analysis shows that O shares majority of lithium charge which is about 90% and Mn shares remaining 10%. In the case of LNMC where lithium concentration in the final de-lithiated compound is x = 0.17, Li valence charge is mainly concentrated on O which is about 81.15%, however, it is reduced from that of LMO as Mn (11.04%), Co (3.73%) and Ni (4.08%) participate in a charge transfer process. This has been noticed for other layered oxide systems as well where Li valence charge mainly localized to oxygen p-orbitals.35–37 2.7 Redox center and effective charge To understand the redox center in the charge transfer process, CV analysis is presented along with effective charge calculations for different atoms. Furthermore, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 8) has been conducted to confirm the oxidation states of transition metals in the parent phases. Fig. 8a shows the wide spectra for LMO encompassing the signals for C 1s, Li 1s, Mn 2p, and O 1s. The core level spectrum for Mn 2p (Fig. 8b) appears at the binding energies of B642 eV (2p3/2) and 653 eV (2p1/2). The deconvoluted Mn 2p spectrum indicates the presence of Mn4+ species.38 Similarly, Fig. 8c displays the wide spectra of LNMC. Individual elemental spectra (Fig. 8d–f) are found at 854–869 eV, 779–794 eV and 642–653 eV Fig. 6 Galvanostatic charge–discharge profile with a theoretically calculated voltage plot for (a) Li2MnO3 and (b) Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2.

The Li 1s peak was observed at B53.5 eV for both the samples and the peak at B529 eV could correspond to the oxygen atoms in both the LMO and LNMC. Fig. 9 shows the CV curves of LMO and LNMC. CV has been performed between 1.75 and 4.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a sweep rate of 0.05 mV s1. In both the figures during the initial charging process the sharp peak at around 4.6 V is attributed to the Li+ extraction with a concurrent oxygen loss and structural rearrangement. The peak at B3.3 V corresponds to the redox process of Mn3+/Mn4+. In Fig. 9b, peaks at B3.7 V and B4.3 V correspond to the redox process of Ni2+/Ni4+ and Co3+/Co4+ respectively. Effective charge (q) calculation (Table 1) also confirms the redox centers for both the compounds. q is calculated after taking the difference between Qx and number of valence electrons of x. For LMO the effective charge of Mn and O is changed from +1.65e to +1.79e and 1.12e to 0.86e respectively. It suggests that O is mainly redox active in the charge transfer process, whereas for LNMC a change in effective charge of Mn, Ni, Co and O is +1.69e to +1.87e, +1.2e to +1.4e, +1.52e to +1.71e, and 1.14e to 0.8e respectively. This suggests that all are redox active and participate in a charge transfer process. 2.8 Density of states To study the charge transfer mechanism and its electronic origin, the PDOS of Mn-d, Ni-d, Co-d, and O-p orbitals (Fig. 10) has been analysed for LMO and LNMC. For all the compositions oxygen p-orbital stays near to the Fermi energy and it dominates during a charge transfer process. This has been confirmed by the Bader analysis as well. For both the compounds there is no significant change in the Mn-d states. The occupied Ni-d orbitals in LNMC are observed closer to the Fermi energy, which are oxidised on de-lithiation and at x = 1, it appears as an unoccupied orbital in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Co gets oxidised on further deep de-lithiation for x = 0.5 and unoccupied states of Co-d are observed near to the Fermi energy. This suggests that oxidation of Ni takes place followed by Co during de-lithiation of LNMC. CV analysis also confirms the sequence of redox centres in Co substituted LNMC.

At an early de-lithiation stage of LMO, more number of unoccupied O-p orbitals are located near to the Fermi energy as compared to LNMC. This triggered oxygen removal from the structure at the beginning of the charge transfer process in LMO as compared to LNMC. 3 Conclusion The experimental and theoretical findings summarize the electrochemical performance of Li2MnO3 and Li1.17Ni0.17Mn0.5Co0.17O2. DFT studies revealed that Ni and Li octahedra in the LiM2 layer of LNMC are neighboured only with Mn and Co octahedra. Furthermore, it indicated that the de-lithiation of LNMC resulted in two-phase reactions in the region of 1 o x o 0.5 and 0.5 o x o 0.17, and subsequently a voltage plateau was observed at 4.23 V and 4.42 V. This matches well with the experimental observation. Experimentally a two-phase reaction has been observed at a voltage of 4.5 V. The DFT calculations also revealed a charge transfer mechanism wherein the incoming Li charge is mainly localized on O for both LMO and LNMC. In LMO, the presence of more number of unoccupied O-p orbitals near to the Fermi energy helps in the faster removal of O compared to LNMC. With the substitution of Co, an unoccupied O-p orbital shifts towards the Fermi energy as compared to LMNO resulting in the removal of O during the initial activation period. DFT studies analyse the sequence of redox centers while de-lithiation takes place. With the removal of Li in LNMC, the unoccupied Ni-d orbital is determined in the vicinity of the Fermi level followed by unoccupied states of Co-d orbitals, which confirms the sequence of redox center, Ni followed by Co. CV analysis also suggests the oxidation of Ni2+ before Co3+. This study examined the charge transfer mechanism and oxygen removal in Li-rich cathode materials and discussed the role of transition metals and oxygen.

New reaction mechanisms are proposed involving solid-solution regions within both cubic and tetragonal spinel phases in addition to a continuous phase transition between them. In operando NPD is an ideal tool to follow the light elements such as lithium and oxygen in cathode materials which are often the key to fully understand their structural evolutions. Here, we report a novel methodology to prepare an extremely thick electrode with ∼378 mg·cm−2 loading density suitable for the in operando NPD studies. Enabled by such thick electrode, we find that the metal oxygen M−O (M = Li and Mn) bond lengths in both end members LiMn2O4 and Li2Mn2O4 experience pronounced changes larger than dictated by the change in lattice parameters because of the locally formed Jahn−Teller distorted Mn3+. First-principles density functional theory calculations confirm these metastable intermediates and further propose atomistic reaction pathways for the phase transition by coupling a global structure search algorithm. These findings redefine the conventional understandings on two-phase reactions of this spinel material. 1. INTRODUCTION The gravimetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has increased threefold since first commercialization in the 1990s, but the state of the art (250 W h·kg−1) is still insufficient to power electric vehicles for a cost effective and reasonable driving range that can compete with a standard gasoline internal combustion engine vehicle. Maximizing the potential of LIBs requires a firm and comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms during battery operation, including bulk phase transition of electrode materials, chemical variations at multiple interfaces between different battery components, changes in mechanical properties affecting the structural integrity, and so forth.1 However, determining these mechanisms is often difficult particularly when characterizing the battery components outside the real operating environments. To aid better understanding, operando characterization techniques have emerged and grown rapidly in the past decade.2−6 Among operando characterization techniques, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) are important because they can provide insights on atomic locations and dynamics and address basic questions of interest about promising electrode materials such as: what are the phase transitions occurring upon charge/discharge process and how do they proceed?7−12 An operando XRD technique has been developed to take advantage of the high flux, high resolution, and fast acquisition time of synchrotron-based X-ray sources. Many significant achievements have been made relatively recently.13−15 For example, Grey et al.15 have shown that nonstoichiometric Li1−xFePO4 (0 < x < 1) is formed with high-rate cycling, whereas two-phase reaction between fully lithiated LiFePO4 and fully delithiated FePO4 occurs with low-rate cycling. Bianchini et al.14 have revealed new insights on an intermediate spinel phase Li0.5Mn2O4 with Mn3+/Mn4+ 1:3 cation ordering and lithium/vacancy ordering, which is more accurately written as Li0.5Mn0.5 3+Mn1.5 4+O4 with the cubic P213 space group. The operando NPD technique can often provide information about LIBs that are difficult to obtain from any other techniques including X-rays. Neutrons are sensitive to light elements such as Li and O, which are hard to detect with X-rays especially in the presence of heavier elements. Neutrons offer drastically different scattering length for adjacent Received: July 27, 2018 Revised: November 29, 2018 Published: December 5, 2018 Article pubs.acs.org/cm Cite This: Chem.

This enables distinction between some transition-metal elements frequently in use in cathode materials in LIBs. For example, the coherent nuclear scattering lengths for Ni, Co, and Mn are 10.30, 2.49, and −3.73 fm, respectively.16 These advantages are essential to closely monitor structural details such as Li atomic positions and occupancies as well as transition-metal cation orderings, which have been clearly indicated in previous studies.17−20 Some intrinsic difficulties of the interaction of neutrons with battery materials have slowed the development of this technique and its wider applications. For instance, incoherent scattering of the hydrogen-rich electrolyte, separator, and binder creates a large background. Neutron diffraction also requires a high loading of active material. Accordingly, designing a neutron-friendly electrochemical cell that is able to cycle a large amount of active material while minimizing scattering from other cell components is critical. Sharma et al.10 summarized various designs of such electrochemical cells, including large coin-type cells, pouch-type cells, roll-over cylindrical cells, and commercial 18 650 cells. Among these, commercial cells have a limited selection of electrode materials available and often require kilogram-scale electrode materials not available in a typical laboratory setting. We note that the use of hydrogenated electrolyte in commercial cells leads to a raised background in NPD data, which is countered somewhat by the relatively large quantity of electrode materials.20 Rollover cells with reliable electrochemical performance are relatively difficult to assemble. Pouch-type cells usually need graphite as an anode to build up a full cell, but graphite peaks dominate the cathode peaks of interest.21−23 Regarding the compatibility between cells and instrument geometry, cylindrical-type cells are preferable because they often suit the arrangement of detectors, such as at the time-of-flight neutron diffractometer POWGEN (beamline 11A at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source).24 Therefore, an in-house designed large coin-type cylindrical cell is the most favorable one especially when the cell is manufactured from a neutron-friendly metal (V) or null alloy (Ti2.08Zr).25 Nonetheless, it is still very challenging to cycle enough active material within this large coin-type cell, which requires an extremely thick electrode. In this work, we report a facile methodology to prepare an extremely thick electrode with approximately 378 mg·cm−2 loading density of active LiMn2O4 spinel. We also developed a neutron compatible in situ large-coin-type electrochemical cell. This thick electrode and the neutron-friendly electrochemical cell were utilized to study (de)lithiation mechanisms of the Li1+δMn2O4 (0 ≤δ ≤1) spinels. In theory, the spinel-Mn2O4 framework can deliver a capacity of ∼297 mA h g−1 when a Li+ ion is inserted/extracted into/from each of the 8a tetrahedral and 16c octahedral sites at the voltages of ∼4.0 and ∼2.7 V, respectively. Unfortunately, the phase transition related to 2.7 V plateau is only partly reversible because strong Jahn−Teller distortion of MnO6 octahedra occurs due to Mn3+ formation. Lithiation of Li1+δMn2O4 (0 ≤δ ≤1) leads to an increase in the axial ratio c/a of the unit cell from 1.0 in the cubic phase to 1.6 in the distorted tetragonal phase. This anisotropic strain causes fracture of large particles and thus internal contact loss upon cycling.26−28 Although this reaction has been extensively studied, its dynamic features such as the appearance of any intermediate phases have never been fully understood. Herein, via operando NPD, we followed the M−O bond lengths (M = Li and Mn) in the spinels. Their continuously changing M−O features are unexpected according to the conventional understanding of a two-phase reaction and imply that there must be solid-solution regions within both cubic and tetragonal phases. Firstprinciples density functional theory calculations identified intermediate spinel phases (Li1.5Mn2O4) that are accessible during the phase transition and proposed reaction pathways. These findings redefine the conventional understandings on two-phase reactions of this cathode material. 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 2.1. Preparation of Thick Electrode. The procedure to prepare a thick electrode involves three main steps. First, a slurry was prepared by mixing active LiMn2O4 (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%), graphite (TIMCAL, KS6), carbon black (TIMCAL, Super P), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Kynar Powerflex LBG) in a N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Aldrich 99.5%) solution in a weight ratio of 80:4:6:10, respectively, and adding graphite to further increase the electrical conductivity of the composite electrode. Second, the as-prepared slurry was dripped into an aluminum foam (1100 alloy, 40 PPI, ERG Aerospace Corporation) which was mounted on a hotplate. The temperature of the hotplate was set to be 120 °C. Note that the amount of NMP solution needs to be optimized to guarantee that the slurry viscosity is suitable to flow and penetrate the pores. After drying it, a disc electrode was punched out with two different dimensions, 9.5 mm diameter for a Swagelok-type cell testing and 10.6 mm diameter for the neutron in situ cell. Finally, the disc electrode was immersed into a NaOH solution (1.0 M) for 1.5 h to partly remove the aluminum foam template. Then, the electrode was collected from the solution and washed several times using deionized water before drying overnight under vacuum. The loading of active material was measured by subtracting the average weight of punched aluminum foam without the slurry coating. Active material loadings of ∼0.2 and ∼0.3 g were achieved for the 9.5 and 10.6 mm electrodes, respectively. For the operando NPD study shown here, the thick electrode contains 0.33 g of LiMn2O4 powder, corresponding to ∼378 mg·cm−2 loading density. 2.2. Characterization of Thick Electrode. The electrode performance was first characterized using a Swagelok-type half-cell. The as-prepared cathode and Li foil anode were assembled with two pieces of glass fiber separator in an argon-filled glovebox. The electrolyte used was 1.2 M LiPF6 in a 3:7 mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The voltage window was 2.0−4.4 V (vs Li+/Li), whereas 1 C corresponds to 120 mA g−1. The electrode morphology and elemental distribution were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi TM3030Plus) accompanied with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). NPD pattern (collected at POWGEN beamline, center wavelength = 1.33 Å) and SEM image of the LiMn2O4 powder are shown in Figure S1. 2.3. Design of the in Situ Electrochemical Cell. The top-view schematic of the in situ electrochemical cell with respect to the neutron beam and detectors is shown in Figure 1a. This geometry of setup guarantees to fully utilize the capability of all detectors from each scattering angle. An image of the in situ electrochemical cell for the operando NPD experiment is shown in Figure 1b, and a detailed schematic is shown in Figure 1c. Our in situ cell has a geometry configuration similar to that reported by Masquelier et al.25 but modified as per the specific requirements of POWGEN. The core part of this cell is the container made by Ti2.08Zr alloy as highlighted in a blue color in Figure 1c. The Ti2.08Zr alloy has been chosen because its overall coherent scattering length is close to zero (2bTi + bZr = 0), where bTi = −3.438 fm and bZr = 7.16 fm. Consequently, it generates no Bragg peaks from the cell body which makes it effectively invisible to the neutron beam. Additionally, the Ti2.08Zr alloy is highly conductive and corrosion resistant which makes it a perfect current collector and internal spacer. The inner diameter of the cell body is Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 125 1.27 cm, which fits the beam size at POWGEN beamline (1 × 4 cm2). Another core part of the cell is the plunger with attached O-ring that is airtight whilst permitting a copper wire connected through the plunger. Glass fiber was used as the separator to reduce the amount of hydrogen that would be introduced by the conventional Celgard separator. Another roll of glass fiber lines the inside wall of Ti2.08Zr body to avoid short circuits. For the electrolyte, 1.10 M LiPF6 in 31 wt % deuterated-EC (d-EC) and 69 wt % deuterated-DMC (d-DMC) solution was used to further reduce the hydrogen involved. For the anode, 7Li (ORNL National Isotope Development Center, 99.92%, absorption coefficient = 0.0454 × 10−24 cm2) foil was used as it minimizes the neutron absorption compared with using natural Li (absorption coefficient = 70.5 × 10−24 cm2). To minimize the internal contact resistance, the pressure on the working cell components was adjusted by a tube fitting. To reduce the scattering from cell components, a neutron absorber (boron nitride, BN) sleeve was used to cover most of the cell except for the active material of interest. 2.4. Operando Neutron Diffraction Experiment. An operando neutron diffraction experiment was carried out at the POWGEN beamline. The in situ electrochemical cell was cycled in the galvanostatic mode with C/50 and C/80 rates for discharge and charge, respectively, which corresponds to 0.8 and 0.5 mA actual current with 0.91 and 0.57 mA cm−2 areal current densities. There was a 12 h resting procedure in between the discharge and charge processes. The discharge cutoffvoltage was set to be 1.5 V whilst the cell was continuously charged until the beamtime was over (∼70 h). Time-of-flight NPD data were collected for 14 h when the cell was at the open-circuit voltage (OCV) state and every 3 h for the rest of the experiment. The center wavelength was 1.066 Å corresponding to a dspacing range of 0.3−5 Å. Rietveld refinements were carried out using the GSAS suite of programs29 with the EXPGUI interface.30 All of the reflection peaks taken at the OCV state could be accounted for using a multiple phase model including LiMn2O4,31 Li,32 Al,33 graphite,34 and Cu,35 as seen in Figure S2. Unidentified peaks at around 1.68 and 0.99 Å are suspected to be a contribution from the sample environment. Note that the Li2Mn2O4 phase36 is then added to this multiple phase model for the sequential refinement. Li, Al, graphite, and Cu phases are present because of the usage of anode, the preparation of cathode, and the conductive Cu wire. Regarding the two main structures, LiMn2O4 is a cubic phase with Fd3̅m symmetry, whereas Li2Mn2O4 is a tetragonal one with I41/amd symmetry. Figure S3 shows a comparable lattice ordering between them. The O sublattice orders in a similar way with slight movement, whereas the most significant difference between the two phases relies on the occupied tetrahedral-Li in the cubic but octahedral-Li in the tetragonal structure. The isotopic 7Li scattering factor was used for all Li phase refinements. A back-to-back exponential profile function was chosen with the mixing coefficient (η) and microstrain coefficients (Shkl).37 March−Dollase (MD) preferred orientation38 ratios of 110 for Li (metal) and 100 for Al was included. In order to avoid correlation between refined parameters, the occupancies were fixed without refining because LiMn2O4 and Li2Mn2O4 were used as line phases. The atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) of Li8a ( ) , , 1 8 1 8 1 8 , Mn16d( ) , , 1 2 1 2 1 2 , and O32e (x, x, x) for LiMn2O4 phase and O16h (0, y, z) for Li2Mn2O4 phase were refined using the long scan at the OCV state before cycling for LiMn2O4 and then the 12 h resting scan between discharge and charge for Li2Mn2O4. These ADPs were then fixed for the rest of the refinements. These refined structural parameters of LiMn2O4 and Li2Mn2O4 are listed in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. The profile and MD preferred orientation coefficients were refined in the same manner. The ADPs of Li4a (0, , 3 4 1 8), Li8c (0, 0, 0), and Mn8d (0, 0, 1 2) were fixed at the values reported in the literature.36 Finally, the lattice parameters of each phase in addition to the atomic position of O32e in LiMn2O4 and O16h in Li2Mn2O4 phase were all freely refined. Starting from 85 h during charge process, a peak asymmetry develops that cannot be described by the LiMn2O4 phase alone. Another Li1−δMn2O4 phase with a cubic Fd3̅m structure was added to achieve the best fitting, as has been previously reported by Bianchini et al.9 The weighted profile factor Rwp, profile factor Rp, and goodness-of-fit indicator χ2 are listed in Table S1. 2.5. Theoretical and Computational Approaches. For firstprinciples calculations, spin-polarized GGA + U scheme was used with the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation exchange correlation functional39 and the projector augmented wave method40 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).41 520 eV was chosen for energy cutofffor the plane wave, and ionic relaxation was performed until all forces on ions are smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. A k spacing parameter was used to control k-point sampling, and the value was 0.3 Å−1 for relaxations and 0.15 Å−1 for accurate energy and electronic structure calculations generating Γcentered 3 × 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 × 5 k-point mesh, respectively, for cubic-LiMn2O4. A Hubbard U correction value for Mn atom in LiMn2O4 is known not to have a significant effect on the results in the range of 3−6 eV.42 In this study, 3.9 eV, which is the calibrated value for Mn atom by Materials Project, was used. For global structure search on intermediate compositions (Li1+δMn2O4 with δ = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75), the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm43,44 implemented in CALYPSO (Crystal Structure AnaLYsis by Particle Swarm Optimization) software45,46 was utilized in conjunction with firstprinciples total energies. The simulation cell size for structure prediction was chosen from a single formula unit to a size containing 32 oxygen atoms for each composition, and separate structural prediction was performed for each simulation cell size. Each generation contains 30 structures, and structural evolution was performed up to 15 generations using ABC algorithm for global optimization. In between evolutionary steps, local structural relaxation was performed using first-principles calculations until all forces on ions are smaller than 0.03 eV/Å. After obtaining predicted structures from CALYPSO, more accurate relaxations were carried out on every structure using 0.01 eV/Å value for force criteria and accurate energies were calculated. Among the structures obtained through the global structure search, structures showing the same Mn2O4 framework as in the LiMn2O4 spinel were identified and further structural and electronic properties were analyzed. The detailed procedure for intermediate structure identification is shown in Figure S4. Materials database search was carried out on Materials Project.47 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Performance of the Thick Electrode. Because of the need for a large amount of active material within the neutron beam, we designed the extremely thick electrode (diameter: Figure 1. (a) Top view of the experimental setup. (b) Picture of the in-house designed in situ electrochemical cell. (c) Schematic of the cell. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 126 10.6 mm, thickness: 6.5 mm) with active material loading above 300 mg (see Experimental Section). A simple simulation of the relationship between weight, porosity, and thickness was conducted and is shown in Figure S5. When the tap density of active material (D) is 2.5 g cm−3, to achieve 60% porosity electrode, the thickness must be ∼4 and ∼6 mm if loadings were 500 and 300 mg, respectively. Unless the pores inside the electrode are perfectly interconnected so that electrolyte may easily soak in, the Li+ ion diffusion would be a limiting factor to reach full capacity. In this regard, we developed a novel method using an Al foam as a sacrificed template to produce an extremely thick electrode with a high porosity, while still retaining a 3-dimensional conducting pathway for electrons. The preparation details are referred to the Experimental Section. As shown in Figure 2a, the as-prepared electrode used in our operando NPD experiment is ∼6.5 mm thick and contains 0.33 g of LiMn2O4 active powder. Surprisingly, the loading density reaches 378 mg·cm−2 which has not been reported in the LIB community to the best of our knowledge.48,49 It is worth noting that the loading density value normally falls into the scale of ∼2−5 mg·cm−2 at the laboratory level, whereas ∼20 mg·cm−2 at the industry level. Elemental mapping (Figure 2b) and SEM imaging (Figure 2c,d) of the electrode demonstrate the spatial relationship between the active material composite (LiMn2O4 + C + PVDF) and the residual Al foam, which provides enough channels for electrolyte soaking and pathways for electron transportation via the Al metal framework. An enlarged SEM image (Figure 2e) shows the particle morphology of LiMn2O4 with an average size around 30 μm. Figure 2. Appearance (a) and the elemental mappings (b) of the thick electrode.

The diffraction peaks of Li, Al, graphite, and Cu are due to Li anode, residual Al foam in cathode, graphite additive in cathode, and Cu wire in electrochemical cell, respectively. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 127 As shown in Figure 2f, the LiMn2O4 thick electrode was first charged to 4.4 V and then discharged to 2.0 V. It delivered 81.3 mA h g−1 (∼55% theoretical capacity) charge and 146.2 mA h g−1 (∼51% theoretical capacity) discharge capacity. Remarkably, this thick electrode was able to deliver ∼40 mA h· cm−2 areal capacity when discharged to 2.0 V, which is almost one magnitude larger than the commercial LIBs. Regarding the charge/discharge curves in Figure 2f, the two plateaus (4.1 and 4.25 V) in the voltage range of 3.0−4.4 V represent (de)lithiation reaction within Li1−δMn2O4 (0 < δ < 1) whilst an additional 2.7 V discharge plateau demonstrates a typical lithiation reaction within Li1+δMn2O4 (0 < δ < 1). Such performance guarantees sufficient material experiencing (de)intercalation of Li+ ions to be detectable with neutron beam. Note that there is still room to improve the specific capacity by reducing the scale of the individual islands of composite electrode in the middle of the Al framework (Figure 2c,d). Currently, these islands are around 1 mm in diameter which is still too large for Li+ ions to diffuse. 3.2. Operando Observations of the Phase Transition during Cycling. There are three reaction regions during the experiment. Figure 3a shows the discharge/rest/charge profiles of LiMn2O4 electrode between 1.5 and 4.2 V used for the in situ NPD experiment. In region I during discharge, one Li+ ion is intercalated into the LiMn2O4 cubic structure to transform it into tetragonal Li2Mn2O4. Region II (charge) is the reverse process of region I involving a phase transition from tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 to cubic-LiMn2O4. In region III (charge), further de-intercalation of Li+ ion from the transformed cubicLiMn2O4 induces a solid-solution reaction to form Li-deficient Li1−δMn2O4 which is also cubic. 1 represent these reactions. + + → → + − LiMn O (cubic) Li e Li Mn O (tetragonal) (region I, Li stoichiometry: 1 2) 2 4 2 2 4 (1) → + + → + − Li Mn O (tetragonal) LiMn O (cubic) Li e (region II , Li stoichiometry: 2 1) 2 2 4 2 4 (2) δ δ → + + → δ − + − LiMn O (cubic) Li Mn O (cubic) Li e (region III, Li stoichiometry: 1 0) 2 4 1 2 4 (3) Figure 3b,c shows the evolution of NPD patterns and the corresponding zoom in the contour plot (2.30−2.52 Å) throughout the entire three regions, clearly demonstrating a two-phase reaction mechanism for regions I and II whilst a solid-solution reaction mechanism for region III. Specifically, upon Li (de)intercalation in regions I and II, the weight fractions of the individual spinel change as reflected by the continuous variations in the intensities of the 222 LiMn2O4 reflection and 202 Li2Mn2O4 reflection. In region III, we observed a peak shift of LiMn2O4 instead of a new peak formation, indicating the solid-solution reaction between the fully lithiated LiMn2O4 and the Li-deficient Li1−δMn2O4. Figure 3d,e highlights two examples of the Rietveld refinements of the in situ NPD data. Very importantly, the two active material reflections around 2.3−2.45 Å d-spacing are the strongest thanks to the cell and electrode design, which minimizes the unwanted diffraction peaks from the sample environment. It is worth noting that the oxygen information of both spinel phases is what we are trying to explore from this experiment. Figure S6 compares two simulated NPD patterns with full or zero occupancy of O atoms. It demonstrates that the contribution of O atom to 222 reflection in LiMn2O4 and 202 reflection in Li2Mn2O4 is strong enough to provide us confidence to extract reliable information. The fits between the calculated and the observed patterns were good for both active spinels and 7Li anode, as shown in Figure 3d,e (goodness-of-fit parameters are given in Table S1). The mismatch in intensity of Al foam peaks at 1.43, 2.03, and 2.34 Å d-spacing is due to preferred orientations. Figure 4. (a) Voltage profile of LiMn2O4 electrode during the operando experiment. Rietveld refinement results of weight fraction of individual phase (b), lattice parameter a of cubic-LiMn2O4 (c), and lattice parameters a and c of tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 (d). Weight fractions were normalized based on the sum of the weight fractions of nonreactive Al, graphite, and Cu at the OCV state (37.5 wt %). The estimated standard deviations (e.s.d.) are also shown. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 128 Figure S7 provides the weight fractions of Al, Cu, graphite, and their sum. As these three components are nonreactive during cycling, their weight fractions should not change. Therefore, the sum of Al, Cu, and graphite (37.5 wt % for the OCV state) was used to normalize the weight fractions of all other active components to minimize the effect from the amorphous phases. The normalized weight fractions of Li anode, cubic-LiMn2O4, tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4, and cubicLi1−δMn2O4 throughout the entire operando experiment are shown in Figure 4b. About 80 wt % of cubic-LiMn2O4 transforms into tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 during discharge (region I) via the two-phase reaction but is not fully recovered during the following charge (region II). In fact, 44 wt % of tetragonalLi2Mn2O4 remains in the electrode when Li+ ions start to be extracted from the cubic-LiMn2O4 (region III). In specific, Li extraction from both tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 and cubic-LiMn2O4 proceeds simultaneously from 85 h, converting themselves into the Li-deficient cubic-Li1−δMn2O4. Here, it is difficult to determine whether such a coexistence of three phases is intrinsic upon charge, or if it is just induced by the sluggish kinetics of Li+ ion diffusion in such a thick electrode. Figure 4c,d shows the evolution of lattice parameter a for cubicLiMn2O4, and a and c for tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4, respectively; in both cases, they remain constant through the first 85 h (regions I and II), strongly supporting the two-phase reaction mechanism. However, after 85 h (region III), a new cubic phase with lattice parameter a = 8.201(6) Å is detected that coexists with the original one with a = 8.2426(8) Å. Afterward, both lattice parameters continuously decrease to the end of the experiment, indicating a solid-solution reaction as Li+ ions are extracted. Another interesting observation is the evolution of crystalline-Li in the cell (Figure 4b). The amount of crystalline-Li from the Li anode first reduces upon discharge as Li moves from anode to cathode, but it remains almost the same upon the following charge, although Li is moving back from cathode to anode. This indicates that the returning Li never crystallizes. Instead, it deposits into an amorphous structure on the anode’s surface. Such amorphous deposition of Li during charge is not new and has been reported by different groups and different techniques.50−53 In this work, using operando NPD, we present another strong piece of evidence for Li amorphization when depositing onto the Li metal electrode. Note that natural Li was used to synthesize LiMn2O4. Although a small amount of 6Li with a high absorption coefficient possibly transfers from the LiMn2O4 cathode to 7Li anode which may reduce the peak intensity of Li, its effect is still negligible. This is because most of the natural Li is 7Li (natural abundance, 6Li/7Li = 7.5:92.5), which introduces similar coherent nuclear scattering lengths between natural Li (−1.90 fm) and 7Li (−2.22 fm). 3.3. Evidence of Intermediate Metastable Spinels. In the I41/amd symmetry, the Wyckoffpositions of Li4a (0, , 3 4 1 8), Li8c (0, 0, 0), and Mn8d (0, 0, 1 2) are all special whilst only O16h (0, y, z) is general. Thus, refining O position gives reliable information of the Li−O and Mn−O bond lengths. Bond length differences between the two along c-axis and the four in a−b plane of MnO6 octahedra are a clear indicator of Jahn− Teller distortion of Mn3+.54 Interestingly, the bond length of Li−O along c-axis reduces from 2.444(23) to 2.393(8) Å upon discharge in region I and increases back to 2.439(16) Å upon charge in region II, as shown in Figure 5a. Conversely, the bond length of Mn−O along c-axis increases from 2.176(23) to 2.224(8) Å during discharge in region I and reduces back to 2.181(16) Å during charge in region II. Assuming only a twophase reaction between LiMn2O4 and Li2Mn2O4 occurs with the fixed stoichiometric composition for the individual phase, a continuous variation in bond length would not be the case within the tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 spinel. In a conventional theory of a two-phase reaction, there must be a phase boundary within a single-crystal lattice that propagates via (de)intercalation of Li. On one side, it is stoichiometric LiMn2O4 with fixed metal−O (M−O, M = Li and Mn) bond lengths. While on the other, it is stoichiometric Li2Mn2O4 also with fixed M−O (M = Li and Mn) bond lengths.55−57 However, as clearly seen in Figure 5, the M−O (M = Li and Mn) bond lengths in the tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 spinel vary continuously upon cycling. In fact, similar observations are also obtained for the cubic-LiMn2O4 spinel (Figure S8) even though the degree of variation is relatively low. On the basis of the observations described, we propose a new reaction mechanism that involves a formation of nonstoichiometric Li1+xMn2O4 (cubic) and Li2−yMn2O4 Figure 5. Evolution of Li−O bond length (a,b) and Mn−O bond length (d,e) of the tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 spinel (c) during the operando experiment. The e.s.d. is acceptable for drawing conclusions. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 129 (tetragonal) spinel phases and a phase transition between them. Under this mechanism, Li+ ions are first intercalated into LiMn2O4 to form Li1+xMn2O4 with a long-range cubic symmetry but locally distorted on the M−O (M = Li and Mn) bond. The reason is that the intercalated Li+ ion likely occupies the octahedral 16c site (0, 0, 0). To maintain local charge neutrality, an adjacent Mn4+ needs to be reduced to Mn3+. Thus, a local Mn4+−O bond is replaced by a Mn3+−O bond, which is distorted along c-axis. It also causes a slight relocation of O atom that induces an opposite bond length change of Li−O. Note that at this stage, the short-range structure may vary from being cubic even though the longrange structure remains cubic. As more and more Li intercalate into the local structure of cubic-Li1+xMn2O4, it finally reaches a saturation point where the long-range symmetry of Mn-site needs to be lowered to achieve a lower free energy of the whole structure and thus a first-order phase transition occurs. This first-order phase transition leads to another nonstoichiometric phase formation of the tetragonal-Li2−yMn2O4. Then, Li is further intercalated into the Li2−yMn2O4 phase to reach the fully lithiated Li2Mn2O4 composition. It is very important to note that the NPD data only provide an average M−O bond length from all possibly formed chemical compositions of Li1+xMn2O4 and Li2−yMn2O4 throughout all particles. As discharge proceeds, more and more LiMn2O4 particles are activated to become Li1+xMn2O4 prior to the phase transition. Meanwhile, more and more Li2−yMn2O4 particles are fully lithiated to Li2Mn2O4 after the phase transition. Most importantly, these different reactions over a wide range of Li concentrations take place simultaneously within different particles during the whole discharge process. That is why the average bond lengths of Li−O and Mn−O in both tetragonal and cubic spinels continuously change during discharge. A reverse process has been observed during charge. Goodenough et al.58 have studied this LiMn2O4−Li2Mn2O4 transition behavior in his early work and proposed nonstoichiometric cubic-Li1+xMn2O4 (0 ≤x ≤0.1) and tetragonalLi2−yMn2O4 (−0.25 ≤y ≤0.2) phases based on their discharge curve. Two sloped regions at both ends of the discharge curve imply the solid-solution reaction whilst a flat plateau implies a two-phase reaction. Our operando NPD results provide strong crystallographic evidence to support their earlier conclusions. Furthermore, if comparing the bond length change of Mn−O between the OCV and the fully discharged state, one would find a 2.1% difference for the tetragonal spinel (Figure 5e), whereas it is only 0.6% for the cubic spinel (Figure S8b). This implies that the tolerance of Li composition in the tetragonal spinel is much wider than the one in the cubic spinel. 3.4. First-Principles Density Functional Theory Calculations. First-principles density functional theory calculations were performed (see details in the Experimental Section), to explore possible intermediate Li1+δMn2O4 phases that connect the cubic-LiMn2O4 and tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 during the phase transition. Our first-principles approach couples with a global structure search algorithm and materials database searches to efficiently explore intermediate phases. We identified two intermediate states of Li1+δMn2O4 (δ = 0.5) having the same Mn2O4 sublattice as the cubic-LiMn2O4. For a given crystal structure, many different spin configurations are possible (as an example, see refs42,59−63 for possible spin configurations of LiMn2O4). Among them, we investigate the ones with the lowest energy magnetic configurations. In the case of LiMn2O4 (δ = 0) and Li2Mn2O4 (δ = 1), we consider ferromagnetic orderings that have cubic and tetragonal structures, respectively, as the stable configurations. We then compare their structural stabilities with respect to the cubic spinel (δ = 0) and the most stable solid-state Li (bcc Li crystal) by calculating the formation energies (ΔEf) δ Δ = −[ · + ] δ δ + + E E E E (Li Mn O ) (Li Mn O ) (Li) (Li Mn O ) f 1 2 4 1 2 4 bcc 1 2 4 cubic (4) Figure 6 summaries relative stabilities between the stable phases (δ = 0 and 1) and intermediates identified by our calculations as well as the charge states of Mn ions. Note that the valence state of Mn ions in the cubic spinel is Mn3.5+, where both dz 2 and dx 2−y 2 orbitals are partially occupied, in Figure 6.

Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 130 comparison to the orthorhombic spinel with equally occupied Mn3+ and Mn4+.61 Here, we propose the reaction pathway that leads to the phase transition (see Figure 6). In the initial state, Mn3.5+ ions occupy the half of four possible octahedral sites and a Li+ ion is located at one of eight possible tetrahedral sites of a single formula unit (LiMn2O4). Upon the intercalation of Li+ ions (1 Li per 2 LiMn2O4 unit) into the cubic spinel (δ = 0) at the step 1, the additional ions occupy 25% of the empty octahedral sites, whereas the existing Li+ ions remain intact at the tetrahedral sites (see Table S4). The locations of the occupied octahedral sites by intercalated Li+ ions are evenly distributed in all layers of the cubic phase where the charge is balanced by Mn4+ and Mn3+ (with 1:3 ratio) at each layer. In the next step (step 2), the Li+ ions located at the center of the tetrahedra migrate to the 50% of octahedral sites filling the 75% of octahedral sites and the crystal system is transformed into tetragonal. As a final step (step 3), the remaining octahedral sites are filled with intercalated Li+ ions (1 Li per Li3Mn4O8 unit) and eventually transform into the tetragonal phase that has a significantly lower energy by ∼1.5 eV per reaction (see Figure 6a). It is worth noting that these theoretical calculations only provide the possible local symmetry forms rather than the long-range ones; otherwise, the intermediate phases would be seen from their newly formed diffraction peaks. Figure 6b,c highlights the various Mn−O bond lengths of Mn3+O6 and Mn4+O6 octahedra in the intermediate Li1.5Mn2O4 phases the first-principles calculation identified. It is worthwhile pointing out that the bond length of Mn3+−O along c-axis indeed follows the increase trend from cubic-Li1.5Mn2O4 (∼2.20 Å) to tetragonal-Li1.5Mn2O4 (∼2.27 Å) and finally tetragonalLi2Mn2O4 phase (∼2.30 Å).36 This agrees well with the observations from Figure 5e that the average bond length of Mn3+−O along c-axis increases upon discharge while decreases upon charge. Note that the NPD results always provide an average bond length that include all possible intermediate phases from lightly (de)lithiated to heavily (de)lithiated ones. The various (de)lithiation depths from one particle to another thus leads to a slightly different average bond length compared with the values obtained from the calculated intermediate phases. 3.5. Discussions. Our findings on the reaction mechanisms between the cubic-LiMn2O4 and the tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4 are schematically summarized in Figure 7. The larger solidsolution region of the tetragonal phase compared with the one of the cubic phase is demonstrated in the phase diagram, which also corresponds to the discharge curve. Note that this is a representative phase diagram but not accurate. As the particle size of LiMn2O4 is as large as ∼30 μm (Figure 2e), a concentration gradient of Li is easily formed when the current is applied. Thus, the reaction pathway from the center to the surface of a single particle should follow cubic-LiMn2O4 → cubic-Li1+xMn2O4 →tetragonal-Li2−yMn2O4 →tetragonalLi2Mn2O4 during discharge and reverses during charge. The interpretation of whether it is a solid-solution or two-phase reaction implies whether there is a symmetry change from cubic to tetragonal in the long-range point of view. In fact, similar phenomena have been observed via in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the reaction mechanisms of Li4+xTi5O12.64 They also found evidence of a mixed feature Figure 7. Discharge curve (a) and phase diagram (b) of LixMn2O4 and its proposed reaction mechanism in view of a single particle during discharge (c). Figure 8. Schematic illustration of the evolutional volume change of MnO6 and LiO6 octahedra in tetragonal-Li2Mn2O4, representing the reason why the unit cell volume has no change throughout the entire discharge/charge process. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199 Chem. Mater. 2019, 31, 124−134 131 between solid-solution and two-phase reaction, although the in situ XRD looks almost the same over a wide range of Li concentrations. Therefore, the conclusion that a two-phase reaction is always accompanied with solid-solution regions within both end members is suspected to be universal irrespective of reaction rate. Nonetheless, the extension of solid-solution region still depends on the structural tolerance during (de)lithiation. Another interesting observation is that the tetragonal-spinel structure is robust as the unit cell volume has almost no change throughout the entire reaction range even though the intermediate phases are formed, as shown in Figure S9. Figure 8 presents the evolution of the bond lengths of LiO6 and MnO6 octahedra in the tetragonal spinel during cycling, which are obtained based on the operando NPD results. We observe that the volume of the MnO6 octahedra increases upon discharge and decreases upon charge. Conversely, the volume of the LiO6 octahedra decreases upon discharge and increases back upon charge. Consequently, the total effect is that the volume change of a single unit cell is almost zero. 4. CONCLUSIONS In summary, we report a novel methodology to prepare an extremely thick electrode with ∼378 mg·cm−2 loading density and ∼40 mA h·cm−2 areal capacity achieved by cycling LiMn2O4 between 4.4 and 2.0 V (vs Li+/Li). Enabled by such a thick electrode with enough loading of active material, an operando NPD experiment was performed to study the phase transition mechanisms of Li1+δMn2O4 (0 ≤δ ≤1) spinel upon cycling. Through Rietveld refinement of both cubic and tetragonal phases, we found evidence of metastable Li1+xMn2O4 (cubic) and Li2−yMn2O4 (tetragonal) phase formation as the Li−O and Mn−O bond lengths continuously vary during (de)lithiation. First-principles calculations further identified these metastable phases and provided their detailed descriptions on both the crystallographic and the magnetic structures. Accordingly, we propose a comprehensive understanding on the reaction mechanisms involving the solidsolution regions within both cubic and tetragonal symmetries in addition to the two-phase transition between them. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the tetragonal spinel possesses a more robust lattice than the cubic spinel in terms of varying the Li composition without changing its volume. The lack of substantial change in lattice volume is ascribed to the oppositely varying trend between MnO6 and LiO6 octahedral volume. We also believe such metastable intermediate phases exist in most of the two-phase reaction process irrespective of reaction rates. These findings redefine the conventional understandings on two-phase reactions and possibly lead to a wider search for chemical compositions to improve performance of LIBs. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03199.

However, recently, it has been reported that this compound usually does not exhibit such an ideal structure and instead contains a large number of structural defects, not only stacking faults but also mixing of Li and Mn atoms between the 2b and 4g sites. To elucidate the effect of such structural defects on the electrochemical behavior, we examined the crystal structure of Li2MnO3 synthesized at various temperatures by simultaneously analyzing the stacking faults and cation mixing using FAULTS, a Rietveld code. Our examination showed that the crystals consist of both disordered and ordered domains; the disordered domains contain a large number of stacking faults along the c axis and have considerable Li/Mn atomic mixing within the transition-metal layer, whereas the ordered domains have almost no defects. At low synthesis temperatures, the disordered domains are dominant. However, the ordered domains increase at the expense of the disordered domains above 770 °C and become dominant at higher temperatures. It is also found that the degree of cation mixing in the disordered domains remains almost constant irrespective of synthesis temperature. The crystalline defects such as stacking faults or Li/Mn cation mixing are expected to promote the formation of smooth Li percolation paths. The decreasing of the disordered domains leads to dramatically decreased capacity. This indicates that the observed capacities of Li2MnO3 can be determined by the relative amounts of the ordered/disordered domains in the structure. ■INTRODUCTION LiCoO2, LiMnO2, LiNiO2, and their solid solutions, such as LiMn1/3Ni1/3Co1/3O2, are widely used as cathode materials for Li ion rechargeable batteries. These LiMO2 [M: transition metal (TM)] compounds have rocksalt-type layered structures that comprise Li, M, and O layers. In recent years, Li-rich layered compounds such as Li[Li1/3M2/3]O2 or Li2MO3 have been extensively investigated because their specific capacities of higher than 200 mAh/g exceed that of LMO2; among them, a simple system, Li2MnO3, has been widely examined1−8. Such high capacity implies that Li in the TM layer is utilized and thus the topological arrangements of atoms in the crystals is a key to ensure Li movement in the charge−discharge processes; however, their crystals generally contain serious structural defects, such as atomic mixing or stacking faults,2 which makes their precise structural analysis difficult. Many structural examinations of Li2MnO3 have been performed to date. Strobel and Lambert-Andron9 clarified that Li2MnO3 belongs to the C2/m space group and has a cubic-close-packed (ABC...) layered structure (Figure 1). They observed that the TM layer consisted of Li and Mn atoms in an ordered arrangement occupying the 2b and 4g sites. However, Boulineau2 et al. recently showed that Li2MnO3 generally does not exhibit its ideal structure; instead, it contains a large number of stacking faults along the interlayer direction, and there is considerable cation (Li and Mn atomic) mixing in the TM layer. They examined the stacking faults in specimens synthesized at 650 and 850 °C using the simulation program Received: January 1, 2016 Revised: June 6, 2016 Published: June 14, 2016 Article pubs.acs.org/cm © 2016 American Chemical Society 4143 DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b05041 Chem.

DIFFaX,10 which can estimate the contribution of stacking faults to the diffraction intensities and profiles, and revealed that stacking faults and atomic mixing increase when the synthesis temperature decreases. The specific capacity of Li2MnO3 is known to vary with synthesis temperature, with high capacities observed at lower temperatures of around 600 °C.1 This implies that the structural features, which depend on the heat treatment temperature, greatly affect the electrode behavior. Therefore, it is desirable to analyze both crystallographic data and quantitative information on the stacking faults simultaneously. Unlike other codes for Rietveld analysis,11 the FAULTS program created by Casas-Cabanas12 et al., which is a Rietveld code based on DIFFaX, allows not only simulation but also refinement of the experimental pattern: i.e., this program allows us to perform Rietveld refinement to analyze different amounts and types of stacking faults as well as to determine crystallographic structural parameters for multiple phases. In this study, to elucidate the relationship between synthetic conditions, structure, and electrode performance, we examine a number of Li2MnO3 specimens synthesized at a wide range of temperatures from 450 to 1000 °C, scrutinize their structures and structural defects using the FAULTS program, and discuss the effect of the structural features on electrode performance. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Li2MnO3 specimens were synthesized by a solid-state reaction using Li2CO3 and MnCO3 in a molar ratio of 1.05:1 as precursors. The precursors were thoroughly mixed by milling in acetone for 2 h and then dried at 100 °C. The dried precursors were then pelletized at 5 MPa and calcined at 450 °C for 48 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirmed that the pellets contained only Li2MnO3 (space group: C2/m). The pellets were powdered and pressed again to form new pellets, which were then annealed at various temperatures between 500 and 1000 °C for 12 h in air. The heating and cooling rates were both 300 °C/h for all the annealing temperatures. Additionally, some specimens were prepared using LiOH·H2O and MnCO3 (2.1:1), but changing the precursor did not have any effect on the structural features. Inductively coupled plasma (for metals) and iodometric redox titration (for oxygen) analyses revealed that the compositions (in at%) for two of the synthesized products were Li, 32.7; Mn, 14.3; O, 47.7 (annealing at 700 °C); and Li, 33.6; Mn, 15.4; O, 48.8 (annealing at 900 °C). For fabricating the positive electrode, a mixture of the active material, acetylene black (Denki Kagaku Kogyo), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Kureha) in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 was spread onto an aluminum foil with 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and then dried overnight at 80 °C under vacuum. The electrode was pressed to a typical thickness of 30−35 μm. Metallic Li foil (0.2 mm in thickness, >99.9%, Honjo Metal) was used as the counter and reference electrodes. These components were assembled along with the polyolefin separator and soaked in the electrolyte solution in an Arfilled glovebox, which was sealed in an aluminum-coated laminate-type cell. The 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a 3:7 (v:v) mixture of anhydrous ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) (Kishida Chemical) was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature on an automatic cycling and data recording system (HJ1001SD8, Hokuto Denko). The cells were galvanostatically cycled between 4.8 and 2.0 V vs Li/Li+ at a current rate of 10 mA/g. Powder XRD patterns were collected between 15° and 125° at a scan rate of 1°/min (in 2θ) on a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) equipped with a Johansson-type monochromator and D/teX Ultra, a high-speed one-dimensional X-ray detector.13 The applied isotropic thermal displacement parameters (Biso) for Li, Mn, and O were fixed at 1.0, 0.5, and 0.8 Å2, respectively, to prevent divergence of the least-squares refinement.2 The atomic configuration of the material synthesized at 700 °C was directly observed on an aberration-corrected STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy, JEM-2100F, JEOL Ltd.) operated at 200 kV, using crushed polycrystalline particles supported on holey carbon films. A radial Wiener filter (HREM Filters, HREM Research Inc.) was applied to the images for noise reduction. HAADF (highangle annular dark-field) STEM image simulations were conducted using MacTempasX (Total Resolution LLC). ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 1. Electrochemical Performance.

To the right of the model, the atomic configuration of the TM layer is shown, where the open and filled circles indicate Li and Mn, respectively. The rectangle represents the a−b unit cells. In this layer, Li atoms forming a triangular net are surrounded by Mn atoms in a honeycomb lattice. Figure 2. First charge/discharge curves of Li2MnO3 electrodes synthesized at 450, 700, and 900 °C. The measurements were carried out between 2.0 and 4.8 V (vs Li/Li+) at a rate of 10 mA/g at room temperature. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b05041 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 4143−4150 4144 specimens. The charge/discharge current rate was 10 mA/g, corresponding to ca. 1/50 C, which is low enough to ensure that a quasistatic process is realized. The specimens synthesized at 450 and 700 °C show high charge/discharge capacities; on the other hand, the specimen annealed at 900 °C exhibits a very low capacity. This demonstrates that the amount of Li available for charging/discharging is significantly decreased between 700 and 900 °C, which suggests that structural modification of the material has occurred. 2. Simultaneous Analysis of Stacking Faults and Li/ Mn Mixing. The powder diffraction patterns obtained for the synthesized Li2MnO3 materials are shown in Figure S1 (see Supporting Information). Structural pre-examination of various possible atomic arrangements in this compound confirmed that the obtained specimens contained only a few vacancies at any atomic site; this is in agreement with the chemical composition analysis results, which suggest that the number of cations nearly equals that of anions. However, a large amount of Li and Mn atomic mixing at the 2b and 4g sites, previously reported by Boulineau2 et al., was also observed in our Li2MnO3 crystals. Consequently, we then included the site occupancy g for the Mn atoms at the 4g site (gMn 4g ) in the structure refinement. When gMn 4g = 1.0 (100% Mn at the 4g site), the 2b and 4g sites are exclusively occupied by Li and Mn atoms, respectively, which corresponds to the model described by Strobel and Lambert-Andron.9 In addition, a large number of stacking faults were also observed in our specimens; fairly intense diffuse peaks arising from the stacking faults were observed, especially at the bottom of the 020 and 110 reflections, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information; also see Figures S2 and 4). These diffuse peaks are more noticeable in the diffraction patterns of the specimens synthesized at lower temperatures. In the stacking fault analysis using FAULTS, we assumed a structural model of the pseudotrigonal cell shown in Figure 3 (space group: P1̅) that comprised three rigid slabs of −O−TM−O− Li−layers, wherein stacking faults were allowed only in between the slabs and could never be generated inside the slabs. According to Boulineau2 et al., in order to express all possible atomic configurations generated by the stacking faults, the three vectors for describing the stacking faults are defined as [0, 0, 1], [1/2, −1/6, 1], and [1/6, −1/6, 1] in the unit cell ([−1/3, −1/3, 1/3], [1/3, 0, 1/3], and [0, −1/3, 1/3] in the pseudotrigonal cell); the stacking probabilities associated with these stacking vectors are given by three α parameters, viz., α11, α12, and α13, respectively. These parameters indicate the probabilities of normal (cubic) stacking, the other cubic stacking, and hexagonal close-packed (ABAB...) sequences, as seen in the right illustration in Figure 3. If the TM layer has the Figure 3. (Left) Pseudotrigonal cell for FAULTS analysis with the original C2/m (monoclinic) cell and (right) a rigid slab viewed along the pseudotrigonal c axis. A rigid slab consists of four atomic layers (−O layer −TM layer−O layer−Li layer−). It is assumed that stacking faults can occur only in the area between the slabs (shown by open red arrows). Shift vectors of the stacking faults are shown by thin red arrows. Figure 4. Observed (+) and calculated (red line) X-ray diffraction profiles of Li2MnO3 synthesized at (a) 700 °C and (b) 900 °C.

The background profiles are shown by green lines. Some peaks on the low-angle side are labeled with their Miller indices, and strong peaks from unreacted Li2CO3 are shown with arrows.

The refinement results for the specimen synthesized at 700 °C are shown in Figure 4a and Table 1 (shown in the original C2/m cell configuration). As seen in this figure, the superstructure reflections, (110), (1̅11), (021), and (111), are almost obscured by the diffuse intensities arising from the stacking faults. However, the FAULTS program successfully determined the structure with defects, i.e., with atomic mixing Table 1.

Mater. 2016, 28, 4143−4150 4146 and stacking faults, using these diffuse intensities and the Bragg intensities. The calculated diffraction pattern shows very good agreement with the observed one, including the region of these superstructure reflections. As shown in Table 1 (and Figure 6, to be discussed later), g was not unity; our analysis showed that about 10% of the Li/Mn mixing at the 4g site (i.e., 20% Li/Mn mixing at the 2b site) took place in the TM layer. Table 1 shows that α11 and α12 are about 70% and 30%, respectively, whereas α13 is almost zero. This shows that the hexagonal closepacked arrangement that requires short O−O pairs of 2.4 Å along the interlayer direction is quite unlikely to appear (note that the O2−ion radius is about 1.4 Å14). 3. Direct Observation of the Defects in the Li2MnO3 Crystals. We also used HAADF STEM to confirm the presence of cation-mixed structures and stacking faults in the Li2MnO3 compounds. In HAADF STEM images, the brightness can be directly correlated to the atomic number Z (it is approximately proportional to the square of Z).15 Figure 5 shows the HAADF STEM image of the Li2MnO3 specimen synthesized at 700 °C. The bright spots show the positions of Mn atomic columns in Li2MnO3 along the [100], [110], and [11̅0] zone axes, which are indicated by solid, dashed, and dashed−dotted lines, respectively. The coexistence of these three crystal orientations in a single image indicates that the compound synthesized at 700 °C definitely contains stacking faults, as has been shown in other reports.2,16 In addition to the stacking faults, defective contrasts, indicated by white arrows, were observed in the TM layers in this image. Since the specimen contains few vacancies, as deduced from the XRD and chemical composition analysis, such disordered contrasts can be attributed to intense mixing of Li and Mn. In fact, the simulated HAADF STEM image in Figure 5, made using a hypothetical structure model with heavily disordered atomic arrangement (gMn 4g was assumed to be 0.6), is in good agreement with the observations in the A−A′ region. Various other contrast disorders can also be explained by different degrees of cation mixing. It is suggested that these atomic arrangements are averaged to lead to the XRD results containing the disorder and atomic mixing. 4. Formation of Ordered Crystalline Domains at High Synthesis Temperatures. Next, we examined the structures of the specimens obtained at high temperatures. For the specimen obtained at 900 °C, the convergence of the FAULTS analysis becomes poor when a single-phase is assumed, as shown in Figure S2a. Generally, Li2MnO3 specimens obtained at high synthesis temperatures of over 800 °C show sharp (020), (110), (1̅11), (021), and (111) diffraction lines out of diffuse peaks, as shown in Figure S1; at the same time, the diffuse peaks become weak as the synthesis temperature increases. According to Boulineau2 et al., this suggests the generation of highly crystalline domains in addition to the disordered crystalline domains with stacking faults. We then performed the FAULTS analyses by assuming that these specimens consist of crystalline domains with and without stacking faults. In the latter case, we further assumed that there was no Li/Mn atomic mixing in the TM layers and the diffraction intensities were incorporated into the background to simplify the calculation. The background profile of the specimen obtained at 900 °C is shown in Figure 4b. As shown in this figure, the multiphase analysis results indicate very good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated patterns, showing that this specimen consists of both ordered domains without any cation mixing and stacking faults as well as disordered domains with both defects. The refined structural parameters of the disordered domain are listed in Table 1, indicating that the structural features related to the disordered domain are similar for specimens obtained at 700 and 900 °C. 5. Temperature Dependence of Structural Features. The analysis of all specimens was carried out using FAULTS, with the assumption that the specimens consist of both disordered and ordered domains. Figure 6 summarizes the structural features of the disordered domains for specimens obtained at various synthesis temperatures. The features are almost unchanged irrespective of the synthesis temperature, indicating a constant degree of disorder in the disordered domain. The volume fraction of the disordered domains was estimated by comparing the scale factors (integrated intensities) of the disordered and ordered domains with the background for the ordered domain. We also assumed that the Figure 7. Fraction of the disordered crystalline domains estimated by FAULTS analyses. The dashed line in the figure was obtained by fitting 1 −a(T −Tc)β; T ≥Tc to the data from the 800 to 1000 °C range. The critical temperature (Tc) and critical index (β) are 773 ± 22 °C and 1.24 ± 0.25, respectively (a = 0.00077 ± 0.00113). Figure 8. Occupancy factor (gMn 4g ) and translation probabilities (α11, α12, and α13) in Figure 6 averaged (corrected) by the disordered domain fraction in Figure 7. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b05041 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 4143−4150 4147 densities and compositions were identical for both domains. The volume fraction of the disordered domains is shown in Figure 7. As seen in this figure, below ca. 770 °C, the specimens consist entirely of disordered domains, while above this temperature, the fraction of disordered domains decreases and ordered crystalline domains grow on increasing the temperature. This also shows that the proportion of stacking faults and atomic mixing in the whole specimen decreases as the synthesis temperature increases, because the defects in the specimen are diluted by the ordered domains. When volume fraction correction is applied to Figure 6, the structural features shown in Figure 8 are obtained, indicating that the defects decrease on average for specimens synthesized at high temperatures. 6. Structural Features and Their Advantages for Battery Application. The high charge−discharge capacity for the low-temperature-synthesized Li2MnO3 materials, shown in Figure 2, can be ascribed to the structural characteristics Figure 9. Stereographic views of the three individual Li atoms ((a) Li(1), (b) Li(2), and (c) Li(3); see Table 1) within an asymmetric unit in perfectly ordered Li2MnO3 with the first-nearest O atoms and second-nearest metal atoms depicted by the intersection technique. Li, O, and Mn are indicated by dark green, aqua, and pink, respectively. The metal atoms are linked by bars. When the Li ions move into neighboring metal atomic positions along any of these bars, they must break through the potential barriers formed by the two O ions and four Li/Mn ions, as shown in illustrations (d), (e), and (f). In this crystal, only these three arrangements of the six obstacle atoms are observed. The three illustrations, (d), (e), and (f), all provide two different views of the six obstacle atoms: one is normal (left) and the other is parallel (right) to the moving axes. The bottom illustration (g), which is depicted in the perfectly ordered structure model, shows a Li−Mn chain (connected by bars) with their obstacle atoms (cross-sectional view); this chain can function as a smooth Li percolation path when the Mn atoms are replaced by Li. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b05041 Chem. Mater. 2016, 28, 4143−4150 4148 revealed herein, namely, the large number of stacking faults and significant atomic mixing occurring in these crystals. It is deemed very important for the Li-rich cathode material to make effective use of Li ions in both the TM and Li layers, and smooth Li percolation paths between the TM and Li layers are desirable for the utilization of these ions. It is expected that such Li percolation paths are formed when the sites of the Li and Mn atoms in the TM layer are exchanged, as detailed below. The stereographic views in Figure 9a−c show three individual Li atoms in the asymmetric unit of the C2/m space group with their first-nearest O atoms and second-nearest metal atoms. Before the Li ion at each center can jump into the positions of the 12 neighboring metal atoms, it has to pass through the potential barrier produced by six obstacle atoms, viz., two O ions and four Li/Mn ions, located around each jumping axis in all 12 directions [all kinds of jumping passes are included in the three polyhedra (a−c)]. In an ordered crystal with no stacking faults and no atomic mixing, the hopping Li ion necessarily encounters the potential barrier formed by the contribution of one or two Mn ions (see Figure 9d and Figure 9e) within two steps. Of the three types of obstacle atoms, Mn atoms provide the greatest hindrance to the passage of the migrating atoms through the barriers because they are tetravalent cations (Mn4+), thus producing a significantly large Coulomb potential barrier to cut offthe migration paths. Consequently, when these obstructing Mn ions are replaced by Li ions, the potential barrier is expected to decrease considerably (see Figure 9f), which has been predicted by the calculations.17 In the crystal structure of Li2MnO3 with a large number of stacking faults and significant cation mixing, replacement of the obstacle Mn atoms with favorable Li atoms allows the formation of three-dimensional (3-D) chains with low Coulomb potential barriers, leading to smooth Li ion diffusion (percolation) (see Figure 9g) and enhanced Li utilization. This is considered one of the reasons for the superior performance of Li2MnO3 materials synthesized at lower temperatures. It is noted that, in contrast to the rate capability, on which the effect of the material surface area cannot be disregarded, the capacity at low rates shown in Figure 2 can clearly be correlated with such a structural effect. A similar effect is expected for other Li-rich compounds. ■CONCLUSIONS We examined the crystal structure and defects of Li2MnO3 synthesized at various temperatures using FAULTS, a Rietveld code based on DIFFaX. Three possible stacking vectors, viz., [0, 0, 1], [1/2, −1/6, 1], and [1/6, −1/6, 1], were adopted to describe the stacking faults in the unit cell, and our analysis clarified that the first two vectors are dominant. In addition to these stacking faults, considerable Li/Mn atomic mixing was observed in the TM layers. This cation mixing as well as the large number of stacking faults favors the formation of long and smooth 3-D Li percolation paths, which leads to high capacities. These structural defects are stable up to around 770 °C; however, ordered crystalline domains begin emerging around 770 °C, and they grow with increasing temperature. This implies that Li2MnO3 changes into an ordered crystal at high synthesis temperatures, which hinders the formation of 3-D Li percolation paths in the crystal. Although Li2MnO3 itself may not be an attractive cathode material due to its poor cycle performance, we believe that a basic understanding of this simple system can contribute to the development of better Lirich compounds and better batteries. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b05041.

Electrochemical charge–discharge cycling of HT-LiMnO2 showed an initial charge capacity 113 mA h g−1, followed by a small first discharge of 25 mA h g−1. The discharge capacity subsequently increased and reached up to ∼120 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. In situ synchrotron diffraction showed that HT-LiMnO2 transformed to a new phase (Phase II) during the first charge process, which was metastable and could easily convert to spinel LiMn2O4 in the following cycles. The progressive formation of this spinel phase was responsible for the capacity increase of the battery in the first cycles. The different cycling performance of HT-LiMnO2 and LT-LiMnO2 was attributed to the large stacking faults in LT-LiMnO2, which may facilitate the material to completely convert to spinel LiMn2O4 in the first charge without the medium transition to Phase II. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction The cathode material LiCoO2 has been intensively used in marketable lithium ion batteries since its first introduction into market in the 1990s. Despite the success of LiCoO2, the development of a future generation of lithium batteries is critically dependent on replacing this cathode material. In recent years, extensive attention has been devoted to Li–Mn–O compounds due to their higher capacities and voltages, lower cost and toxicity than LiCoO2. Lithium batteries using spinel LiMn2O4 as cathode materials have been intensively studied and are already in the process of commercialization [1–3]. However, LiMn2O4 still faces some problems such as the gradual capacity fading upon cycling especially at high temperatures above 50 °C, as well as its limited reversible capacity ∼120 mA h g−1. Li–Mn–O compounds with the formula of LiMnO2 would be an ideal choice, provided most of the lithium could be extracted–inserted since this corresponds to a much higher capacity of 285 mA h g−1 than LiMn2O4. Depending on synthetic conditions, LiMnO2 can form either a monoclinic structure with space group C/2m, or an orthorhombic structure with space group Pmnm. The former one has been successfully prepared by a lithium/sodium exchange reaction from α-NaMnO2 [4–6]. It has been well demonstrated that the so-prepared compound is metastable, which will completely transform to a spinel LiMn2O4 phase within a few charge–discharge cycles [7]. Recently, numerous attention has been devoted to orthorhombic LiMnO2 aiming at the marketable use of this material. Different research groups have prepared orthorhombic LiMnO2 at low temperatures (Tb450 °C, herein marked by LT-LiMnO2) [8,9] or high temperatures (TN800 °C, herein marked by HT-LiMnO2) [10,11]. It was shown that the structure of LT-LiMnO2 could be described by introducing an amount of stacking faults into the ideal structure of HT-LiMnO2. Kötschau and Dahn reported by means of in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) that LT-LiMnO2 Solid State Ionics 178 (2007) 253–257 www.elsevier.com/locate/ssi ⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ssi.2006.11.018 converts irreversibly to a spinel LiMn2O4 phase after the first charge [12]. The subsequent first discharge delivered a high Li+ capacity near 200 mA h g−1, which could maintain a good reversibility over long term cycling. It has often been stated in the past that HT-LiMnO2 phases were not good cathode materials for lithium batteries [9,13]. However, numerous recent works on HT-LiMnO2 have shown promising battery use of these materials provided they were properly prepared. The electrochemical cycling of these HTLiMnO2 were characterized by a small discharge capacity about several tens mA h g−1 in the first cycle, which then subsequently increased to 120–160 mA h g−1 in the following 10–30 cycles. The materials afterwards exhibited good cycling performance over hundreds of cycles. Croguennec et al. pointed out that a large surface area and a high Li/Mn cationic exchange ratio are necessary factors for the good electrochemical performance of HT-LiMnO2 [14]. Former ex situ XRD studies have shown that the structure transition to spinel LiMn2O4 is also unavoidable for HTLiMnO2 [15,16]. After a careful comparison one may see that the cycling behavior of HT-LiMnO2 is somewhat different from that of LT-LiMnO2. The latter shows almost no gradual capacity increase in the initial cycles as occurring for HT-LiMnO2, but directly reaches the reversible capacity (∼200 mA h g−1) already after the first cycle [12,17]. Accordingly, different structural transitions in the initial electrochemical cycles are expected for HTand LT-LiMnO2. The details of the structural transition of HT-LiMnO2 can be revealed by in situ synchrotron diffraction using high-energy radiation. In this work, we employed in situ synchrotron diffraction to study the structural properties of HT-LiMnO2 in order to elucidate the difference in the structural changes of HT-LiMnO2 and LT-LiMnO2 during electrochemical process. 2. Experimental HT-LiMnO2 was prepared by a solid-state reaction method. The precursor was a mixture of LiNO3 (Aldrich company, 99.99%) and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (Merck company, 98%) weighted in a Li:Mn molar ratio of 1.02. A small excess of lithium was added to compensate for lithium evaporation at high temperatures. The homogeneous mixture was initially heat treated at 400 °C for 5 h. Then the resultant powder was pressed into a pellet and heated at 500 °C for 3 h in Ar atmosphere to ensure the complete decomposition of the starting materials. The furnace temperature was subsequently raised up to 900 °C at a speed of 1 °C min−1. The pellet was then sintered at this temperature for 12 h to obtain the target material. Electrochemical charge–discharge cycling was carried out with a multichannel potentiostatic–galvanostatic electrochemical interface VMP (Perkin Elmer Instruments, USA). A Swageloktype cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove box with H2O and O2 contents less than 1 ppm. For the fabrication of the cathode electrode, 80% active material, 15% acetylene carbon black and 5% poly-vinylidenefluoride were intimately mixed, and then pressed onto an Al-mesh. The resulting electrode contained 8.85 mg of active material. The electrolyte was a 1 M solution of LiPF6 in EC:DMC (2:1 by volume ratio) soaked in a glass–fiber separator. The current density for the charge–discharge cycling was 40 mA g−1 (∼C/7). In situ synchrotron diffraction was carried out in transmission mode at the powder diffraction beamline B2 of the Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (DESY) at Hamburg, Germany. The battery was a modified Swagelok-type cell [18]. It consists of a lithium anode, separator soaked with electrolyte and a cathode electrode which is a pellet containing 17 mg of active material. The aluminum cathode holder and copper anode holder served as current collectors. The cell was mounted on a flat sample holder, which can be oscillated to reduce preferred orientation effects and enhance powder statistics. A wavelength of λ=0.47189 Å was selected by a double-crystal Si (111) monochromator. The current density was 10 mA g−1 (∼C/28) during the collection of in situ diffraction data. The diffraction data of the 1, 13 and 28th cycle were recorded using the on-site readable image-plate detector OBI [19]. The intermediate cycles were performed off side the beam to enable measurements on more different samples and with a higher current density of 40 mA g−1 to reach higher cycle numbers within the fixed Fig. 1. The first charge–discharge potential profiles of the Li∣HT-LiMnO2 cell. Fig. 2.

Wei et al. / Solid State Ionics 178 (2007) 253–257 period of allocated beam time. Rietveld refinement was applied for data analysis using the WinplotR package [20]. 3. Results and discussion Galvanostatic cycling was carried out for the Li∣HT-LiMnO2 cell in the potential region 4.3–2.0 V. Fig. 1 displays the charge–discharge potential profiles of the first cycle. The charge–discharge cycling of this battery started with the removal of Li+ from LiMnO2, which gained a charge capacity 113 mA h g−1. The following first discharge delivered a much lower capacity of 25 mA h g−1. The first charge potential profile was dominated by a voltage plateau around 3.6 V, which was absolutely different from that of the subsequent first discharge. This indicates an irreversible structural change taking place in the cathode material during the first charge process. Fig. 2 displays the discharge capacities versus cycle numbers of the battery cell. The discharge capacity subsequently increased and reached up to ∼120 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. The material thus exhibited a good cycle life, showing a reversible discharge capacity 120–140 mA h g−1 over 130 cycles. Fig. 3(a) shows the synchrotron diffraction pattern of the fresh battery cell. Rietveld refinement of the pristine HTLiMnO2 was performed using the structural model in Ref. [21]. It was confirmed that the pristine cathode material was orthorhombic LiMnO2, crystallizing in the space group Pmnm. Additional diffraction peaks could be attributed to the Li anode and Al current collector. The structural parameters listed in Table 1 show that the present HT-LiMnO2 had a large cationic disorder on the lithium and manganese sites, i.e. about 14% of the Li positions are occupied by Mn and vice versa. This large cationic disorder in HT-LiMnO2 is reasonable considering that the Li+ and Mn3+ cations have similar size in octahedral environment (Li+: 0.76 Å, Mn3+: 0.645 Å) [22], and both of them occupy the (2a) sites. Croguennec et al. pointed out that the presence of Mn within the Li sheets may improve the electrochemical behavior of the disordered materials compared with that of the ordered phase [16]. Fig. 3(b) displays the in situ diffraction pattern of HTLiMnO2 collected at the end of the first charge (state of charge: 4.3 V). Note that this in situ cell gained a larger first charge capacity 130 mA h g−1 than the above Swagelok cell due to the much lower current density employed. Two selected 2θ regions of the total 32 in situ diffraction patterns, 4.2°b2θb5.1° and 17°b2θb20°, are displayed in Fig. 4 to show the structural evolution of HT-LiMnO2 during the first charge. It is seen from Fig. 4 that the intensities of the (010), (221), (131) and (002) peaks of orthorhombic LiMnO2 decreased with Li+ extraction. In the mean while, two new peaks appeared at 2θ=4.55 and 18.5°, and their intensities progressively increased. Based on these observations it can be stated that orthorhombic LiMnO2 transformed into a new phase (marked by Phase II) during the first charge process, which was consistent with the voltage plateau at ∼3.6 Von the first charge potential profile (Fig. 2).

Wei et al. / Solid State Ionics 178 (2007) 253–257 is observed that both the diffraction peaks of HT-LiMnO2 and those of the newly formed phase became broader and broader with Li+ extraction. This suggests the formation of defects (e.g. microstrain and stacking faults) in the material lattice, or that the crystal particles cracked into some smaller ones during the electrochemical process. On the other hand, even though the peak intensities of the HT-LiMnO2 phase decreased with Li+ extraction, they didn't disappear completely after the first charge. This indicates that a proportion of HT-LiMnO2 didn't participate in the initial electrochemical process and remained in the cathode electrode. It is mandatory to clarify the crystal structure of Phase II since it is closely related to the electrochemical properties of HTLiMnO2. However, up to now there is not a definite description on the crystal structure of this new phase. Croguennec et al. have suggested that it might have a spinel or hexagonal structure [14]. But there are no experimental facts to support this proposal. It has been well documented that the first diffraction peak of Li–Mn–O spinel or hexagonal structures is located at d spacing ≈4.7 Å [16,23]. However, the present in situ diffraction patterns in Fig. 4 clearly show that the first diffraction peak of Phase II appeared at d≈5.9 Å (2θ≈4.56°). This is rather a big value that cannot be assigned to either a spinel or a hexagonal structure. We have tried to refine Phase II using spinel, hexagonal and other structural models. But none of them gave a satisfactory result. At present we will not concentrate on this challenge but continue to investigate how Phase II behaves during the following cycles. Fig. 5 displays the diffraction patterns of the cathode material after 1, 13 and 28 cycles, collected at the state of charge 4.3 V. The intensities of the diffraction peaks belonging to Phase II and non-reacted HT-LiMnO2 decreased with cycling. Meanwhile, some new peaks appeared at 2θ≈5.77, 11.06, 17.36, 19.79 and 23.22°, which are characteristics of the formation of a new phase (marked by Phase III). Both Phase II and the non-reacted HT-LiMnO2 could not be observed from the diffraction pattern after 28 cycles, indicating that the cathode material completely transformed to Phase III. Rietveld refinement was carried out on Phase III (Fig. 6) and confirmed it has a typical spinel structure with the cell parameter a=8.1239 Å. The incremental capacities versus discharge potentials of the Li∣HT-LiMnO2 cell are plotted in Fig. 7 in order to determine the electrochemical redox potentials of the cathode material. It is seen from the figure that three incremental peaks appeared at ∼2.88, 3.96 and 4.11 V, and their intensities increased with cycling. The enhancement of the incremental peaks was proportional to the amount of active cathode material participating in the Li+ insertion process. It is noticed that the peak positions are very similar to those obtained from spinel LiMn2O4: the one located at 2.88 V corresponds to Li+ insertion into the octahedral sites, while the other two at 3.96 and 4.11 V are due to Li+ insertion into the tetrahedral sites. These observations suggest that the spinel phase (Phase III) progressively formed in the initial charge–discharge cycles was the active material providing the discharge capacities of the Li∣HT-LiMnO2 battery. Note that a trace of Phase III could be observed on the diffraction pattern after the first charge (Fig. 5), which caused the small first discharge capacity 25 mA h g−1 of the material. Fig. 5.

Conclusions We have pointed out that HT-LiMnO2 and LT-LiMnO2 may undergo differentstructural transitions in the initial electrochemical stage since they exhibit different cycling performance. According to Dahn's work, LT-LiMnO2 completely converts to a spinel LiMn2O4 phase after the first charge. The present study showed different structural properties for HT-LiMnO2, which underwent an irreversible structural transition from orthorhombic to a new phase (Phase II) during the first charge. Up to now the crystal structure of Phase II was not resolved. However, it can be stated that Phase II only acts as a transition phase during the electrochemical process. It is metastable and can easily transform to a spinel LiMn2O4 phase in the following cycles. This spinel phase is the active material that contributes to the discharge capacities of the battery. The small first discharge capacity of HT-LiMnO2 was attributed to the slight spinel phase that formed during the first charge. Therefore, it is obvious that the structural conversion from orthorhombic to spinel is much easier for LT-LiMnO2 than for HT-LiMnO2, because LT-LiMnO2 completely converts to spinel LiMn2O4 already after the first charge. Considering the difference in microstructures of LTand HT-LiMnO2, it can be suggested that the different structural properties of the two LiMnO2 phases are attributed to the large stacking faults in LTLiMnO2, which may facilitate the material to completely convert to the spinel phase in the first charge without the medium transition to Phase II.

Bøjesen, Martin Søndergaard, Steinar Birgisson, Jacob Becker and Bo B. Iversen* The hydrothermal synthesis method offers an environmentally benign way of synthesizing Li-ion battery materials with strong control of particle size and morphology, and thereby also the electrochemical performance. Here we present an in depth investigation of the crystal structure, microstructure and electrochemical properties of hydrothermally synthesized LiMn2O4, which is a widely used cathode material. A range of samples were synthesized by a simple, single-step hydrothermal route, and the products were characterized by elaborate Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data, electron microscopy and electrochemical analysis. A distinct bimodal crystallite size distribution of LiMn2O4 was formed together with a Mn3O4 impurity. At high LiOH concentration the layered LixMnyO2 phase was formed. The crystallite sizes and impurity weight fractions were found to be highly synthesis dependent, and the amount of spinel impurity phase was found to correlate with deterioration of the electrochemical performance. The Mn3O4 phase can be very difficult to quantify in standard powder X-ray diffraction and due to peak overlap and X-ray fluorescence impurity levels of more than 10% are easily hidden. Furthermore, the spinel LiMn2O4 phase can easily be mistaken for the layered LixMnyO2 phase. The present study therefore highlights the importance of thorough structural characterization in studies of battery materials. Introduction Li-ion battery technology has developed into an integral part of modern society, fulfilling the needs for portable energy storage in devices such as tablets, cell phones, laptops and potentially also in larger scale mobile energy storage applications including electric vehicles and possibly large scale grid storage of renewable energy.1 An indispensable step on the way towards exploitation of the full potential of the Li-ion battery technology is the development of high-performance electrodes. Many of the cathodes used in Li-ion batteries are based on intercalation compounds. Among these intercalation cathodes three structures stand out as the most prevalent i) olivine structures (LiFePO4), ii) layered LiCoO2 structures and iii) spinel type structures (LiMn2O4).2 A common feature of these intercalation cathodes is that Li+-ions can diffuse easily in and out of the host framework structure without causing a significant destabilization of the framework. Commercially, the layered LiCoO2 compound has been widely used; however it poses some serious safety and environmental hazards, combined with a relatively high cost. The cheaper, safer and more environmentally benign alternative spinel type LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathode has been commercialized in an effort to alleviate these issues.3–5 A plethora of LiMn2O4 synthesis methods have been reported in literature.6–13 It has, in many cases, been shown that a strong correlation between the nanoand microstructure of the product and the electrochemical performance exists.14–17 Thus, when choosing a synthesis method it should be considered how the given method affects particle size and morphology.18–20 Studies have proven hydrothermal synthesis effective in achieving some degree of control of particle size and morphology for a vast amount of different advanced functional materials, including materials relevant to Li+ ion battery technology.21–26 One important aspect of the hydrothermal process is the possibility of tuning structural and microstructural features of the synthesized products by varying different reaction parameters including precursor concentration, pH, temperature, synthesis time, and reaction pressure. Furthermore, the comparatively low energy requirements and fast reaction rates achievable 1996 | CrystEngComm, 2016, 18, 1996–2004 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 Department of Chemistry and iNANO, Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

Several obstacles regarding the characterization of these types of materials were encountered and our paper has focus on identifying and alleviating these.32–35 One particular concern is accurate phase analysis with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in the presence of strong fluorescence (high background). It is shown that seemingly minor impurity contents can be deceptive, and that proper Rietveld modelling and multi-method analysis are necessary to obtain a correct material characterization.27 Hydrothermal synthesis of LMO was first presented by Liddle et al.,36 and three structures are relevant when discussing the synthesis products: spinel LiMn2O4, layered LixMnyO2 and spinel Mn3O4, the latter often referred to by the mineral name, hausmannite. Spinel LiMn2O4 (Fig. 1) features cubic close-packed oxygen ions occupying the 32e positions and Li ions occupying one-eighth of the tetrahedral 8a sites while Mn occupies half of the octahedral 16d sites.37,38 The framework can thus be viewed as [MnO6] octahedra sharing edges, and in this fashion forming channels allowing Li+ion diffusion.39 The manganese cations in the structure are assumed to be equally divided between the oxidation states +3 and +4 and randomly distributed on the 16d sites, resulting in an average manganese oxidation state of +3.5. Approximately at room temperature, and dependent on the thermal history of a given sample, LiMn2O4 can undergo a phase transition upon cooling to a rhombohedral structure (Fddd) and at even lower temperatures to the tetragonal structure (I41/amd). These transitions occur due to charge ordering of the Mn ions and the accompanying effect of the Jahn– Teller distortion of the MnIJIII) ions.40,41 Cycling of LiMn2O4 in a battery cell entails changing between the two oxidation states, but the cycling mechanism is quite complicated. The complexity arises primarily due to the Jahn–Teller active MnIJIII) ions. Increasing amounts of MnIJIII) in the structure will cause an increase of the c/a ratio of up to 16% and consequently cause a cubic to tetragonal phase transition. Moreover, the MnIJIII) ions undergo disproportionation at the surface of the LMO particles. Both factors contribute to a limitation of the practical voltage range in battery cells based on this compound.42 Layered LixMnyO2 crystallizes in the R3 ̄m space group and is iso-structural with LiCoO2, however containing Li and Mn vacancies due to stoichiometric deviations. Similarly to LiMn2O4, LixMnyO2 can be envisaged to consist of edge sharing [MnO6]-octahedra. However, these only share edges within single layers and thus no three dimensional [MnO6] based framework exists. The layers are stacked alternatingly with Li ions along the c direction. LixMnyO2 offers a higher gravimetric capacity compared with the spinel phase, owing to the more favourable Li/Mn ratio of the layered structure.43 During cycling, the layered structure readily converts to the more stable spinel-type by diffusion of Mn-ions into the Liion containing layers. This structural transition occurs with ease due to the similarities of the two structures and is not reversible. Both structures contain the same cubic-close packed oxygen sub lattice, and thus the conversion only entails diffusion of the mobile cations.5,43,44 The layered structure is of limited commercial interest and remains mainly of interest as a precursor stage for the spinel LiMn2O4 phase. The close relation between the two structure types, and thus their very similar PXRD patterns, has previously been highlighted for the LiCoO2 based analogues. For these cobalt compounds a low-temperature variant with 6% of the Co atoms located in the Li layers, was modeled equally well by Rietveld refinements based on either the R3 ̄m space group or Fd3 ̄m space group.45 The PXRD patterns of the Mn-based structures also exhibit many resemblances to each other. Mn3O4 can crystallize in a spinel type structure, and like the aforementioned structures, it features a ccp lattice of oxygen. In Mn3O4, MnIJII) resides in the tetrahedral sites while MnIJIII) is located at the octahedral positions.46 This particular manganese oxide is a common impurity formed when synthesizing Li–Mn–O compounds by wet chemical methods e.g. due to non-stoichiometry, lacking Li incorporation or redox related issues. In a recent in situ PXRD study we have used a similar synthesis method as in the present work to show the prevalence of Mn3O4 formation during synthesis.28 Experimental Synthesis All samples were prepared in steel autoclaves lined with a 19 mL Teflon insert using a synthesis method similar to the one presented by Liddle et al.36 0.2157 g KMnO4 (p.a. Merck) was dissolved in 10.5 mL 0.10 M LiOH (LiOH·H2O (p.a. Bie&Berntsen A/S)). 0.125 mL ethanol (96%) was added as reducing agent. The ∼60% filled autoclave was placed in a preheated furnace at 180 °C for times ranging from 2 h to 48 h. After the respective reaction time had elapsed the autoclaves were removed from the furnace and allowed to cool to room temperature by convection. The product was washed and centrifuged with demineralized water three times to remove any water-soluble impurities. The samples are named based on their synthesis time i.e. LMO-3.5h, LMO-4.3h, etc. For evaluation of electrochemical performance, galvanostatic cycling was performed on CR2032 type halfcells. The half-cells were assembled with Li-metal foil as counter and reference electrode, and two pieces of 25 μm Fig. 1 The crystal structures of (left) spinel LiMn2O4 and (right) LixMnyO2 depicted with blue [MnO6]-octahedra.

The electrolyte was 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) in the ratio of 1 : 1 by volume. For the working electrode, the active material was mixed with SuperP conducting carbon and polyvinylidene diflouride (PVDF) in the weight ratio of 76 : 12 : 12 and coated onto aluminium-foils giving a thickness of the dry layer of ∼30 μm. The working electrodes were compressed with ∼40 kN cm−2. The cells were assembled in a glove box with water and oxygen levels at ∼1 ppm. After assembly the cells were charged and discharged at various currents between 3.5 V and 4.3 V. Synchrotron PXRD High-resolution synchrotron PXRD data were collected on the large Debye–Scherrer image plate diffractometer at beamline BL44B2, SPring8, Japan, using λ = 0.499818IJ4) Å. The powders were filled in 0.3 mm glass capillaries and spun during measurements. The higher signal to noise ratio and q-space resolution of the synchrotron data compared with the in-house parallel-beam setup comes at the cost of a more uneven background due to the use of glass capillaries as sample containers. In-house PXRD In-house PXRD data were collected using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer fitted with a rotating Cu anode. Parallel beam optics with a Ge(220) double-bounce monochromator, 5 mm incident slit, soller 5° incident optic and soller 5°/1D receiving optic were employed to achieve the best possible trade-off between resolution and intensity. A D/tex Ultra PSD detector with fluorescence suppression was used. For comparison, data were also collected on the same Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer, but in a standard configuration that measures data similar to many data in the literature. This includes parallel beam geometry without monochromatization of the incident beam. Furthermore, no fluorescence suppression was used on the detector and the incident slit size was set to 10 mm. Rietveld refinements Rietveld refinements were performed using the Fullprof Software suite.47 The peak profiles were modeled based on a Thompson Cox Hastings pseudo Voigt formalism,48 incorporating axial divergence a symmetry. The instrumental contribution to the peak profiles were determined by refinement of a NIST LaB6 standard. All crystallites were modelled as spherical crystallites. Based on TEM images this is a good approximation for one group of crystallites (the smallest), whereas larger platelet-like morphologies were also detected. Due to the complexity of the model, it was decided not to include anisotropic size broadening. Instead the crystallite sizes were determined based on integral breadth methods and the Scherrer equation.49 The background was modelled by linear interpolation between a set of points with refineable height. Occupancies, atomic displacement parameters and position were not refined and kept at the values found in literature (LiMn2O4; ICSD card no. 50415, Mn3O4; ICSD card no. 002024, Li0.78Mn0.85O2 ICSD card no. 173134.). This choice of refined parameters was made to minimize parameter correlation and due to the fact that test refinements including refinement of these parameters led to either unphysical values, non-significant improvements of the fit and convergence issues. Further discussion of the refined models are presented below. Transmission electron microscopy Bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a Philips CM20 electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and a CCD camera. HR-TEM images were recorded on a TALOS F200A with a TWIN lens system, X-FEG electron source and a Ceta 16M Camera. Diluted samples were prepared by sonication in ethanol and individual drops were placed on the respective TEM grids (200 mesh copper grid with formvar/carbon support film) and dried at ambient conditions. Results and discussion Data considerations Interpretation of PXRD data collected on hydrothermally synthesized LMO products, which are often assumed to be pristine LMO, can be challenging. Weakly-scattering Li, X-ray fluorescence from Mn and synthesis impurities with similar structures and complex microstructural features all contribute to this. High-quality data are therefore essential to extraction of reliable structural and microstructural information. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of PXRD data collected using different instruments resulting in data sets of varying quality. There are significant differences in signal to noise ratio, instrumental peak profile resolution and q-space resolution. Fig. 2 PXRD patterns collected with different setups, illustrating the differences in data quality achievable. The sample is in all three cases LMO-5h.

View Article Online CrystEngComm, 2016, 18, 1996–2004 | 1999 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 Minor impurity peaks clearly visible in the “SPring 8-BL44B2” dataset are nearly indistinguishable from the background in the “standard-in-house” dataset. In the “optimized-in-house” dataset the impurity peaks are barely visible. Rietveld modelling of LMO A complex phase composition was found to be present in all synthesized LMO samples. Three crystalline phases were necessary to achieve a satisfactory Rietveld model: one spinel Mn3O4 and two LMO phases to describe a bimodal crystallite size distribution which was found to be present in all samples. Within each size distribution, small LMO crystallites (10–30 nm) were found to have ∼6–8 % smaller unit cell parameters than the large LMO crystallites (60–120 nm). This combination of two groups of crystallites gives rise to peak profiles being almost super-Lorentzian. Owing to the differences in lattice parameters, the small crystallites contribute with broad tails at high angle in the peak profiles and the large crystallites cause sharper profiles at low angle. The effect on the pattern is illustrated in the insert of Fig. 3. Refinement of occupancies, positions and other structural parameters provided no reliable explanation for the difference in unit cell parameter between large and small crystallites. Except for the scale factor, no refinement of intensity related parameters were performed due to the appreciable number of parameters and complex phase composition, including large peak overlaps and low scattering contrast between constituents in the samples. One probable origin of the differences in unit cell could be a varying quantity of oxygen vacancies. This relation has been shown previously by neutron scattering experiments.50 A larger concentration of oxygen vacancies in the structure will decrease the average oxidation state of Mn, which increases the ionic radius and expands the unit cell. SEM studies have previously shown bimodal particle size distributions to be a common feature in LMO samples synthesized by hydrothermal methods.36,50,51 Here we show by PXRD that a bimodal crystallite size distribution also exist for LMO from hydrothermal synthesis. PXRD data collection with poor instrumental resolution and low signal to noise ratio will hide this subtle but important feature. The size distribution found using PXRD and Rietveld refinement is supported by TEM images (Fig. 10). Fig. 3 Rietveld refinement of the Spring8-BL44B2 data of sample LMO-5h, the insert shows the contribution of both LMO phases to the bimodal crystallite size distribution.

View Article Online 2000 | CrystEngComm, 2016, 18, 1996–2004 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 The effect on the goodness of the fit by inclusion of multiple phases is shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4A, a fit based on a single LMO phase is shown. The profile of the peak is not well reproduced by this simple model; asymmetry towards the high angular region is not well described and at least one peak is not accounted for at all. In Fig. 4B a model containing two LMO phases with different crystallite sizes and different unit cell parameters has been applied. Inclusion of the second phase allows for a satisfactory fit of the asymmetry, but the two-phase model lacks modelling of several peaks e.g. at ∼64.6 degrees. Inclusion of nanocrystalline Mn3O4 as a third phase results in a further improved fit, Fig. 4C. The goodness of fit significantly improves upon addition of each phase; going from 9.1 for the single-phase model, 4.4 for the two-phase model and finally 2.0 for the three-phase model. Visual inspection of the fit corroborates the model. However, due to the complex microstructural features, overlapping reflections and limited data quality, the fit is still not perfect. Various issues such as anisotropic morphologies, defects, non-stoichometry and the fact that measurements were performed at room temperature near the phase transition from cubic to orthorhombic, causes problems; these cannot be solved for the current samples using the present data. Attempts were made at improving the Rietveld model by including more advanced features such as Fig. 5 Synchrotron PXRD patterns of samples (top) LMO-5h-15 and (bottom) LMO-5h. The higher LiOH content in the precursor in LMO-5h-15 results in crystallization in the layered R3 ̄m space group instead of the spinel Fd3 ̄m space group.

None of these refinements improved the fits significantly, and these models also possess higher degrees of parametric correlation. Thus, the relatively complex model was kept as simple as possible. The importance of performing Rietveld refinement instead of simple peak search-and-match procedures cannot be emphasized strongly enough. If simple matching of peak positions was used, the bimodal size distribution would not have been detected and a 40% Mn3O4 impurity would have been unnoticed. Issues regarding data quality and structural similarities were also observed. These can be exemplified by varying the Li/Mn ratio in the synthesis procedure. It was found that increasing LiOH concentration 2.5 times or more in the precursor relative to the concentration of KMnO4 lead to a gradual change in the composition of the product from mainly LMO towards the layered LixMnyO2. The only phase present at LiOH/KMnO4 molar ratios above 7.5 in the precursor was LixMnyO2 (see ESI,† Fig. S4). The structural similarity of the two lithium–manganese–oxide phases (LixMnyO2 and LMO) is so overwhelming that their PXRD patterns are difficult to distinguish. In this respect, matching of peak positions will often not suffice to distinguish one from the other or to detect mixtures. A demonstration is seen in Fig. 5 which shows synchrotron PXRD patterns for LMO-5h and a LixMnyO2 sample synthesized using the same conditions but with 15 times the LiOH concentration (named LMO-5h-15). In comparison with conventional data collected with a CuKα source the displayed 2θ range is equivalent to approximately 15–80°. By using the shorter wavelength (∼0.5 Å) a larger q-range can be covered, thus allowing for more accurate structural refinements. When inspecting the range covered in a standard laboratory based experiment (Fig. 2) it becomes evident that the diffraction patterns of the two structures are nearly identical within this range. Significant deviations are mainly found as differences in the relative peak intensities, but there is one extra peak in the LixMnyO2 pattern at 2θ ∼21° that cannot be found in the LMO pattern. There is also an asymmetric peak at 2θ ∼6° which is presumably caused by diffuse scattering originating from stacking faults along the c-axis of the ordered cationic planes.52 An effective way of circumventing these types of issues with phase identification is by the use of Rietveld refinement. If an incorrect structural model is applied to PXRD data of a sample, the refinement will only converge slowly, and the quality of the fit can be quantified based on reliability factors. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6 where the layered R3 ̄m structural model is applied to data from a LMO sample (LMO-5h) and the spinel Fd3 ̄m structural model to a LixMnyO2 sample (LMO-5h-15). For the LMO model applied to the LMO-5h-15 data, the fit is poor, especially the intensities are far off and one peak at 2θ ∼21° is left unaccounted for. Moreover, the position of some of the peaks in the model and data coincide, while others do not. This can only be resolved by lowering the symmetry of the model. In contrast the LixMnyO2 model applied to LMO-5h is slightly more successful at describing the data, but nevertheless the intensity distribution in the model does not correspond to the data, and only a severe overparametrization or unphysical values of various parameters can get the model to fit the data. Since the layered LixMnyO2 does not find much use in battery applications there will be no further discussion of this phase. In the ESI† a small parameter study of the influence of LiOH on phase composition is given. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the synthesis product can be changed from a spinel to a layered structure simply by raising the LiOH precursor concentration.

View Article Online 2002 | CrystEngComm, 2016, 18, 1996–2004 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 Reaction time study The ratio between the three different phases varies greatly in the samples with changing synthesis times ranging from 3.5 h to 48 h. No crystalline product was obtained for reaction times shorter than 3.5 h. The most significant effect of increasing reaction time is the presence of the Mn3O4 phase and the disappearance of the small LMO crystallites. However, this change in phase composition has a surprisingly small impact on the overall appearance of the PXRD patterns of the samples as seen in Fig. 7. The two samples with the shortest reaction time show no obvious signs of Mn3O4, while in the pattern for LMO-5h the only clear signs are the three very low intensity peaks around 2θ = 28–32°. In a “standard in-house” measurement these peaks disappear in the background (see Fig. 2) mainly due to the strong X-ray fluorescence from Mn. A significant overlap between the Mn3O4 and LMO peaks exists and consequently the content of Mn3O4 seems qualitatively insignificant. The overlap of the two phases is so pronounced that the diffractogram of LMO-48h with a phase fraction of nearly 70% Mn3O4 still on a first inspection appears to be dominated by LMO. The main reason for this is that the most intense peak of the Mn3O4 phase at 2θ = 36° completely overlaps with an intense peak of the LMO phase. The variation in crystalline phase composition as extracted from refinements is shown in Fig. 8. Samples with a short reaction time consist primarily of small LMO crystallites, although the bimodal size distribution of LMO crystallites was observed in all samples. The fraction of large crystallites remains virtually constant for all synthesis times, whereas the amount of small crystallites decreases significantly. The weight fraction of Mn3O4 seems to change almost inversely proportionally to that of the small crystallites, indicating a connection between the appearance of Mn3O4, and disappearance of the small crystallites. The refined crystallite sizes for the all samples are plotted in Fig. 9 as a function of reaction time. The size of all three crystallite fractions increases with synthesis time, albeit at very different rates. The small LMO crystallite average size increases from about 10 nm to 30 nm rather linearly, whereas the large crystallites rapidly increase their average size from about 50 nm to 110 nm, reaching a plateau around this value, increasing only slightly with prolonged reaction time. As for Mn3O4, the initial crystallites are roughly the same size as the small LMO crystallites, but with increased reaction times their size increases significantly by comparison. These trends are supported by TEM (additional micrographs can be found in the ESI,† Fig. S3). TEM images of LMO-4.3h and LMO-48h are shown in Fig. 10 together with HR-TEM images of LMO-24h. The LMO-4.3h sample has a large fraction of small sized to large-sized particles compared with the LMO-48h sample. The TEM images also confirm the average growth of the particles with time. Moreover, the HR-TEM images of LMO-24h show slight indications of high defect concentrations or partial reduction at the surface of the particles. It should be noted that TEM micrographs show area weighted particle sizes, and for polydisperse samples these do not coincide with the volume averaged crystallite sizes determined by PXRD. Combining the trend in crystallite size shown in Fig. 9, with the weight fractions plotted in Fig. 8, one may suggest a possible explanation for the observed formation of the Mn3O4 impurity and changes in crystallite sizes. The weight fraction of the small crystallites decreases while the weight fraction of the large crystallites remains stable. Because of the concurrent increase in Mn3O4 weight fraction it is assumed that the smallest LMO crystallites convert to Mn3O4 via a solid–solid transformation. The conversion from LMO to Mn3O4 requires a decrease of the average oxidation state from 3.5 to 2.667. Additionally, Li-ions have to exit the structure accompanied by a rearrangement of a fraction of Mn ions from octahedral positions to tetrahedral positions. The reduction likely takes place on the surface of the crystallites. Comparatively short diffusion paths for lithium out of the structure and a large number of surface sites and defects all contribute to the destabilization of LMO. Small crystallites generally exhibit a higher concentration of all of these components and thus it can be rationalized why the small crystallites convert more readily to Mn3O4 than the larger ones. Electrochemical performance The LMO samples discussed in the previous sections were tested as cathode material in battery cells. The presence of an impurity of Mn3O4 will degrade the electrochemical performance due to the fact that Mn3O4 is not electrochemically active in the same voltage range as LMO.19 Indeed, previous studies investigating LMO cathodes containing a Mn3O4 impurity have shown lower specific capacity.6,20 The deteriorating effect of Mn3O4 on the electrochemical performance can be observed in Fig. 12 for four different samples with varying Mn3O4 phase content. The cells of these samples were cycled five times at C/10, C/2, C, 5C and 10C followed by 50 cycles at 1C (1C = 148 mA g−1). The voltage versus capacity for the first two cycles for the samples LMO-4.3h and LMO-48h is shown in Fig. 11 (voltage versus capacity curves for LMO-3.5h and LMO-24h can be seen in Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The charge–discharge curves for both samples exhibit the two-plateau behaviour characteristic for the LMO cathode that has been described in detail elsewhere.53 The curves show no sign of Mn3O4 being electrochemically active within the voltage windows as has been shown before.54 A significantly higher first cycle discharge capacity of 99.2 mA h g−1 for the LMO-4.3h sample compared with 43.2 mA h g−1 for LMO-48h is shown in Fig. 11. The LMO-4.3h (along with LMO-24h see ESI,† Fig. S2) show a huge irreversible charge capacity at low potential on the first delithiation, which probably is due to a short circuit of the cell during assembly as the PXRD did not show any sign of Li2−xMn2O4. The short circuit resulted in an overlithiation of the LMO CrystEngComm Paper Published on 17 February 2016. Downloaded by Toyota Research Institute of North America on 5/13/2025 7:28:14 PM.

The superior electrochemical performance of the sample with low Mn3O4 content is highlighted in Fig. 12 where the two samples containing the lowest Mn3O4 wt% outperform the high Mn3O4 wt% samples in terms of both capacity and rate capability. At all the tested C-rates the samples with low Mn3O4 wt% showed a higher capacity, except at 10C where none of the samples showed any capacity. The better rate performance of the LMO-3.5h and LMO-4.3h might also be ascribed to the smaller average crystallite size. Conclusions Rietveld refinement was applied to study the complex crystalline phase composition of hydrothermally synthesized lithium–manganese–oxide materials. The samples were shown to consist of either spinel LMO with a bimodal crystallite size distribution and a Mn3O4 impurity or layered LixMnyO2 at high LiOH concentrations. Upon increased reaction time the weight percentage of Mn3O4 increased, and this was demonstrated to have a significant impact on the electrochemical performance of cathodes made from the synthesis product. Detection and quantification of the Mn3O4 impurity is difficult due the high degree of structural similarity between LMO and Mn3O4. The intensity of the few non-overlapping Mn3O4 peaks are in the order of the background noise in standard in-house PXRD measurement. When examining the literature on hydrothermally synthesized LMO it is evident that the experimental capacities generally are appreciably lower than the theoretical capacity of 148 mA h g−1. It is likely that some of this discrepancy can be explained by large impurity fractions of Mn3O4, which is undetected and thus not accounted for. This present study highlights the necessity of doing Rietveld refinements on PXRD data instead of settling for “fingerprint” identification of crystalline phases. This is especially true for samples where structurally closely related impurities exist, and for samples that exhibit X-ray fluorescence.

JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY 128, 209—214 (1997) ARTICLE NO. SC967189 Long Range and Short Range Magnetic Order in Orthorhombic LiMnO2 J. E. Greedan1 and N. P. Raju Brockhouse Institute for Materials, McMaster University, Hamilton L8S 4M1, Canada and I. J. Davidson Institute for Chemical Process and Environmental Technology, NRC, Montreal Road, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, Canada Received June 14, 1996; in revised form October 9, 1996; accepted October 15, 1996 The magnetic properties of orthorhombic LiMnO2 have been investigated in detail for the first time. The susceptibility data show several features including a Curie–Weiss regime from 600 to 800 K with hp 5 21056(13) K and leff 5 4.82 lB/Mn31, a broad maximum at 360 K, and a field-cooled (FC), zero field cooled (ZFC) divergence below 100 K. The broad maximum indicates two-dimensional rather than one-dimensional shortrange spin correlations. A Ne ́ el temperature for a transition to three-dimensional long-range order is seen at 261.5 K from both neutron diffraction and the magnetic heat capacity behavior as determined from the susceptibility data. The magnetic structure has been solved from neutron diffraction data and has a propagation vector of k"(1/2 1/2 1/2) and an ordered magnetic moment of 3.69(4) lB/Mn31 with a preferred direction parallel to the b axis. The neutron scattering data also provide evidence for two-dimensional short-range correlations above Tc at 271 K in the form of a feature with a Warren line shape. The longand short-range order are discussed in terms of the crystal structure which is of the ordered NaCl type distorted by the presence of the Jahn–Teller ion, Mn31. ( 1997 Academic Press 1. INTRODUCTION Orthorhombic LiMnO2 has been known since 1956 and is one of a number of so-called ordered-NaCl structures (1). The detailed crystal structure was deduced first from powder and later from single crystal X-ray diffraction data and is described in Pmmn (2). This compound has received attention recently as a precursor for a cathode material in solid state lithium batteries, as it transforms to a defect spinel structure upon electrochemical removal of Li (3—5). In spite of this increased level of activity there have been no studies of basic physical properties such as magnetism. 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed. Certain features of the crystal structure suggest that this material may have interesting magnetic properties. First, the local environment of the Mn—O octahedron is distorted significantly due to the presence of the Jahn—Teller ion Mn3`, 3d4. There are two long axial Mn—O bonds of 2.298(1) As directed along the b axis and two nearly equal equatorial pairs at 1.920(9) and 1.937(9) As . In typical ordered rock salt phases such as LiNiO2 one finds layers of nearly regular edge-sharing octahedra which stack in a direction normal to the close-packed oxygen layers, resulting in rhombohedral symmetry. For LiMnO2 the oxygen sublattice is sufficiently distorted that the Mn—O and Li—O layers form a zigzag pattern with a stacking direction nearly 45° to that for the typical case (3). As a result of all of the above, the Mn sublattice has some unusual features as illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the hexagonal symmetry found in the rhombohedral, ordered NaCl phases is still present but the layers are distorted significantly and folded, the fold angle being 111°. The basic edge-sharing triangular motif is preserved but the triangles are distorted to isosceles with one edge at the a-axis distance of 2.806 As and the other two at 3.09 As with angles of 63°, 63°, and 54°. Alternatively, one can also view the sublattice as comprised of linear chains of Mn atoms parallel to the a axis with a short Mn—Mn separation of 2.806 As . Two chains run through each cell at z"0.633 and 0.367 with an interchain Mn—Mn separation of 3.09 As . The configuration of the Mn—O octahedra is shown in Fig. 2. As the octahedra share edges, the intraand interchain Mn—O—Mn angles, relevant for superexchange, are essentially identical at 93.3(2)° and 92.8(4)°, respectively. The zigzag Mn—O layers are connected via intervening Li—O layers with a closest interlayer Mn—Mn distance of 5.00 As . Figure 2 is also useful as an aid to understanding the orbital symmetry considerations which determine the 209 0022-4596/97 $25.00 Copyright ( 1997 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

The intrachain Mn—O—Mn 90° interaction will involve the empty dx2~y2 orbitals so this may be weak. The intrachain Mn—Mn interaction will occur via the halffilled t2g(dxz) orbitals and will be strongly antiferromagnetic. The interchain exchange coupling is also by a 90° Mn—O—Mn pathway but the orbitals involved are dz2—O—dx2~y2 and this will be relatively weaker and probably antiferromagnetic as discussed by Goodenough in comparison with other Mn3` materials showing a static Jahn—Teller distortion (6). Thus, it is a good assumption that the strongest exchange interaction in this material will be the antiferromagnetic Mn—Mn interaction along the short a axis. FIG. 2. Edge-sharing Mn—O octahedra in LiMnO2. FIG. 3. Possible symmetry cancellation effect between antiferromagnetically correlated Mn chains in LiMnO2. In addition, geometric effects may also be important. As already argued, the Mn sublattice can be regarded as a set of interwoven a-axis chains with atom positions in adjacent chains displaced along c and also along a by (1/2 0 0) such that an atom in one chain centers two spins in each adjacent chain, as depicted in Fig. 3. If the intrachain interactions are strongly antiferromagnetic as expected, the interchain coupling may be subject to a symmetry cancellation as shown. Thus, at the highest temperatures the magnetic correlations would be one dimensional with cross-overs to two and, ultimately, three dimensionality as the temperature is lowered. 2. EXPERIMENTAL (a) Sample Preparation LiMnO2 Samples of the orthorhombic form of LiMnO2 were prepared from Fisher Scientific Certified MnO2 and Aldrich 99.997% pure Li2CO3. The powdered reagents were intimately mixed by grinding and pelletizing. Then the pellets were loaded into high purity alumina crucibles and fired in a horizontal tube furnace under a flow of argon gas. The mixture was first calcined at 600—650°C for several hours to remove the CO2, and then baked at 800—1000°C for 1 to 3 days. Generally, one or two more grindings and firings were required to achieve a well crystallized product. 210 GREEDAN, RAJU, AND DAVIDSON (b) Magnetic Measurements Magnetic susceptibility data were obtained using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer in the temperature range from 5 to 800 K using a 10~2 T applied field. (c) Neutron Diffraction Powder neutron diffraction data were collected at the McMaster Nuclear Reactor using a neutron wavelength of 1.392 As and a position sensitive detector which has been described previously (7). A thin-walled vanadium can was used for room temperature experiments and at low temperatures an aluminum sample holder containing helium exchange gas and sealed with an indium gasket was utilized. The sample was cooled by a closed-cycle refrigerator in the temperature range from 10 to 271 K. Data analysis was carried out using either DBWS PC9600 or FULLPROF (8, 9). 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION (a) Magnetic Susceptibility Figure 4 displays susceptibility data for LiMnO2 over the range from 5 to 800 K. The most striking features are the maximum below 50 K, the field-cooled (FC), zero field cooled (ZFC) divergence below 100 K, and the broad maximum (inset) centered at about 360 K. The occurrence of the broad maximum is evidence for the presence of short-range magnetic correlations, consistent with speculations presented previously. In principle the dimensionality of the correlations can be assessed by fitting the data to models for FIG. 4. Magnetic susceptibility data for LiMnO2 from 5 to 800 K at an applied field of 10~2 T. The squares and triangles represent zero field cooled and field cooled conditions, respectively. The inset shows the broad, weak maximum at about 360 K. oneand two-dimensional magnetic lattices. An attempt to fit to a one-dimensional model, S"2, failed, thus indicating that the dominant correlations in this temperature regime are two-dimensional. This conclusion will be reinforced by the neutron scattering results in the following section. Unfortunately, there exist no calculations for the two dimensional magnetic lattice pertinent here, a puckered, distorted hexagonal net, so it is impossible to carry out a detailed fitting to extract the exchange constant. In any case there is no clear evidence for purely one-dimensional correlations in the temperature regime investigated which indicates that the intrachain and interchain exchange interactions must be comparable. In Fig. 5 the inverse susceptibility is plotted which shows an approach to the Curie—Weiss law at the highest temperatures. The extracted constants are C"2.90(2) emu K mol~1 from which k%&&"4.82 kB/Mn3` can be derived compared to 4.90 kB for a S"2 free ion. A very large, negative h1"!1056(13) K is found which indicates the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions. The data also show a subtle inflection point near 250 K. The inset displays a plot of d(s1)/d1 in this temperature range. This function has been shown to be a measure of the magnetic contribution to the heat capacity (10) and the pronounced maximum at 260 K indicates the presence of a magnetic phase transition. (b) Neutron Diffraction A room temperature diffraction pattern was obtained and the data were refined by the Rietveld method primarily as a check on the sample purity and to compare with the FIG. 5. The inverse magnetic susceptibility of LiMnO2. The inset shows the Fisher heat capacity (10) identifying a transition at 261 K. MAGNETIC ORDERING IN LiMnO2 211 FIG. 6.

The solid line is a three-component Rietveld fit including the chemical structure, the Al sample can, and the magnetic structure of Fig. 7. The vertical tic marks locate the Bragg peak positions for the three respective components, the chemical structure, the sample can, and the magnetic structure (top to bottom). previous X-ray diffraction results. Neutron diffraction is often a more rigorous test of sample purity than X-ray diffraction as the neutron beam probes the entire sample volume. No additional phases were detected and the refined unit cell parameters and atomic positions agreed very well with the results reported previously [2]. Upon cooling from room temperature to 11 K several strong reflections appeared, as shown in Fig. 6, which could be indexed on a unit cell 2a]2b]2c with respect to the chemical cell which implies a magnetic propagation vector, k"(1/2 1/2 1/2). A model for the magnetic structure at 11 K was found readily by assuming antiferromagnetic order within each a-axis chain, that the chains in each puckered layer couple antiferromagnetically, and that the interplanar coupling is also antiferromagnetic. The best agreement was found for a collinear spin model with an ordered moment of 3.69(4) kB with a preferred spin direction parallel to the b axis as depicted in Fig. 7. The fit in Fig. 6 is to a threecomponent model which includes the chemical structure, the aluminum sample can, and the magnetic structure of Fig. 7. The relevant refinement details are listed in Table 1. The temperature dependencies of the two most intense magnetic reflections, (1/2 1/2 1/2) and (1/2 1/2 3/2), are shown in Fig. 8. First, note the clear indication of a critical or Ne ́ el temperature, 1#"260 K, confirming the susceptibility and magnetic heat capacity results of Figs. 4 and 5. A more precise value of 1# can be obtained by fitting data near the ordering temperature to a power law of the type M"M0[(1#!1 )/1#]b, where M is the sublattice magnetFIG. 7. A (0 0 1) projection of the magnetic structure found for LiMnO2. ization, 1# is the critical temperature, and b is the critical exponent (11). The results of such a fitting are shown in Fig. 9 and the fitted parameters are 1#"261.5(5) K and b"0.376(17). This later value is consistent with a threedimensional Heisenberg model which is reasonable for Mn3` (11). Also seen in Fig. 8 is the presence of an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment which sets in below 100 K, the temperature below which FC-ZFC irreversibilities are observed in the bulk susceptibility. Below 100 K the intensities of the strongest magnetic reflections, (1/2 1/2 1/2) at 2h"18.16° and (1/2 1/2 3/2) at 26.94°, deviate in a positive and a negative sense, respectively, from the Brillouin function like dependence which pertains at higher temperatures. This is due, most likely, to the onset of a small sublattice canting below 100 K. Thus, at low temperatures LiMnO2 is a weak ferromagnet. It was not possible to determine the canting angle from the available neutron data but it is likely to be small. One further issue concerns the characterization of the short-range magnetic order above 1#. The powder pattern at 271 K, 10 K above 1# (Fig. 10), shows that all of the magnetic Bragg peaks have disappeared but a pronounced, 212 GREEDAN, RAJU, AND DAVIDSON TABLE 1 Refinement Details for the Magnetic Structure of LiMnO2 at 12 K Chemical cell a 2.806(1) As b 4.550(2) As c 5.747(2) As Magnetic cell a 5.612(2) As b 9.100(4) As c 11.494(4) As Atomic positions (Pmmn)a Li (2a) z"0.125 Mn (2a) z"0.643 O1 (2b) z"0.136 O2 (2b) z"0.600 Magnetic moment of Mn3` 3.69(4) kB Moment direction [0 1 0] Overall thermal factor, Ba 0.500 (As 2) Agreement indices Overall R81"0.077 R%91"0.023 Chemical structure RB"0.016 Al sample holder RB"0.005 Magnetic structure RB"0.086 a Fixed at these values, refinement had no effect on the magnetic moment value.

This peak shape is of the Warren type which is a signal of two-dimensional correlations (12). The insert in Fig. 10 shows a fit of this peak to the Warren function. A two-dimensional correlation length of 36(1) As can be derived using methods described previously (13). Thus, it appears that at 271 K the Mn spins are correlated within the puckered, distorted hexagonal layers which confirms the interpretation of the susceptibility data given previously. FIG. 10.

Finally, Fig. 11 shows that the two-dimensional correlations persist into the ordered regime and that in fact the long-range order grows at the expense of the two-dimensional order. In this figure, data at 200 K, well below 1#, and 271 K are compared after adjusting the background of the two data sets. It is clearly seen that the Warren maximum lies to slightly lower angles than the (1/2 1/2 1/2) Bragg peak and that a vestige of the Warren feature is present at 200 K but with a much diminished amplitude. 4. SUMMARY Although a relatively simple material, LiMnO2 exhibits complex magnetic behavior. Crystallographic distortions due to the presence of the Jahn—Teller ion, Mn3`, result in a Mn sublattice which consists of folded, distorted hexagonal layers. This results in short-range magnetic correlations which are manifested in a broad susceptibility maximum at 350 K. Evidence from both susceptibility and neutron scattering data characterize the short-range order as two dimensional. Below 261 K, long-range antiferromagnetic order is established with a magnetic structure having a propagation vector k"(1/2 1/2 1/2). The details of the magnetic structure are consistent with expectations that the strongest exchange constraints are antiferromagnetic within the a-axis chains and that the structure evolves by interchain coupling to form layers and finally, interlayer coupling. The ordered moment is 3.65(2) kB/Mn3` and the preferred direction is along the b axis. Evidence for the onset of spin-canting below 100 K is found from susceptibility and neutron diffraction data.

Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Magnetic Property of Delithiated LixMnO2 (x < 0.1) Single Crystals: A Novel Disordered Rocksalt-Type Manganese Dioxide Junji Akimoto,* Yasuhiko Takahashi, Yoshito Gotoh, and Kenji Kawaguchi National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 305-8565, Japan Kaoru Dokko and Isamu Uchida Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, Aramaki-Aoba 07, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8579, Japan Received March 12, 2003. Revised Manuscript Received May 13, 2003 Single crystals of the chemically and electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 (x < 0.1) have been successfully synthesized from the parent orthorhombic LiMnO2 single crystals. A singlecrystal X-ray diffraction study revealed that the average structure of LixMnO2 was the disordered rocksalt-type with the space group Fm3hm, and the lattice parameter a ) 4.095(3) Å. Some additional spots indicating the superlattice structure and diffuse scattering could be observed in the X-ray precession photographs. The mechanism of the structural transformation from the parent orthorhombic LiMnO2 to the delithiated cubic LixMnO2 was well explained by the manganese ion migration accompanied with Li+ extraction. The magnetic properties of the chemically delithiated LixMnO2 are compared with those of the parent LiMnO2. The extracted Curie constant in LixMnO2 is consistent with the residual lithium content found analytically, as in the case of λ-MnO2. Introduction Layered lithium manganese oxides have attracted intense research interest as prospective cathode materials in secondary lithium batteries not only because of the low cost and low toxicity of manganese, but also because of their high theoretical capacities.1-4 LiMnO2 is known to exist in two ordered rocksalt-type structures with orthorhombic and monoclinic symmetry, respectively. Orthorhombic LiMnO2 has a zigzag layered â-NaMnO2 type structure with the space group of Pmnm, as shown in Figure 1. The detailed crystal structure of this compound was deduced first from powder, and later from single-crystal, X-ray diffraction data.5-7 It is experimentally well-known that the structure of orthorhombic LiMnO2 cathode transforms gradually and irreversibly into a spinel-type structure during several discharge-charge cycles.2,3 For practical reasons, such a structural change of electrodes is generally unfavorable, but in this case, the electrochemically generated spinel electrodes show significantly better and more stable characteristics of the charge-discharge cycles than the regular spinel-type LiMn2O4 electrodes. Recently, Tang et al.8 reported a structural-transformation model of orthorhombic LiMnO2 to spinel-type LiMn2O4 accompanied by the Li+ extraction. In contrast, Chiang et al.9 reported the role of cation disorder and transformation microstructures on electrochemical performance examined theoretically and experimentally. They predicted an intermediate structure with Fm3hm space group between the parent orthorhombic structure with Pmnm space group and the spinel-type structure with Fd3hm space group, from the viewpoint of crystallographic considerations. However, such an intermediate structure could not be obtained experimentally as an average structure. To clarify the true crystal symmetry, precise crystal structure, and mechanism of the structure change in this intercalation system, the singlecrystal X-ray diffraction method has been highly desired, as in the recent studies of the spinel-type Li1-xMn2O4.10-15 * Corresponding author.

First, we prepare the electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 (x < 0.1) single crystals and determine the precise crystal structure by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. Second, we explain the mechanism of structural transformation by the manganese ion migration accompanied with Li+ extraction. Finally, we demonstrate the magnetic property of the novel disordered rocksalttype manganese dioxide compound obtained by the Li+ extraction from the parent orthorhombic LiMnO2 single crstals. Experimental Section Single-Crystal Synthesis. Single crystals of the orthorhombic LiMnO2 were grown by a flux method, as mentioned previously.16 The as-prepared LiMnO2 powder (Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Japan) was mixed with LiCl (99.9%) as a flux material in the nominal weight ratio of LiMnO2/ LiCl ) 1:10. The flux growth was conducted in a vertical resistance furnace. The mixture was heated to 1273 K for 10 h in a sealed Pt tube, gradually cooled to 873 K, and then cooled naturally. The produced single crystals were easily separated from the frozen LiCl flux by rinsing the Pt tube in water for several hours. Chemical Analysis. Chemical analyses of selected singlecrystal specimens were carried out by SEM-EDX (JEOL JSM5400). The chemical formulas of the samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy using the pulverized single crystals (about 6 mg). Electrochemical Delithiation. The controlled extraction of lithium from a piece of single crystal was achieved by electrochemical means using a microelectrode-based system.17-20 A selected LiMnO2 crystal (0.15 × 0.03 × 0.02 mm3) was placed on a glass paper soaked in 1 M LiClO4/propylene carbonate (PC) + ethylene carbonate (EC) (1:1 vol) solution (Li-ion battery grade, Mitsubishi Kagaku Co.). A Pt-Rh fine filament (25 μm diam) was coated with a thin film of Teflon (Cytop, Asahi Glass), and was then cut to give a micro-disk electrode. The prepared microelectrode was held with x-y-z micropositioner (Shimadzu MMS-77) and brought into contact with the LiMnO2 crystal by handling the positioner under observation with a stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ-U). The electrode potential was measured and controlled against a Li foil reference electrode with a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HA-150). All the electrochemical experiments were conducted in a small drybox filled with air purified by a column (Balston 75-20, 203 K dew point). The electrode potential was stepped from the open circuit potential (OCP, about 3.2 V) of LiMnO2 to a desired value, such as 4.50 V vs Li. After the overnight electrolysis, the potentiostat was switched back to the OCP-measuring mode. We checked the completion of the extraction reaction with the stability of the regulated OCP, the value of which was 4.10 V vs Li. The obtained LixMnO2 crystal was rinsed carefully with pure PC, and then supplied to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Chemical Delithiation. The LixMnO2 single crystals were also prepared by a combined Li-ion extraction/chemical oxidation process. Selected LiMnO2 single crystals were placed in 1 M HCl solution for several hours. No stirring or heating was performed. The obtained LixMnO2 crystals were washed carefully with ethanol, and then supplied to chemical analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and magnetic measurements. Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction. Crystals were examined with an X-ray precession camera (MoKR radiation filtered by Zr foil) to check on the crystal quality and to determine the lattice parameters, systematic extinctions, and possible superstructures. Integrated intensity data for the as-grown LiMnO2 and the electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 single crystals were collected in the 2θ-ω scan mode at a scan rate of 1.0°/min at 296 K on a Rigaku AFC-5S four-circle diffractometer (operating conditions 45 kV, 35 mA) using graphitemonochromatized MoKR radiation (λ ) 0.71073 Å), and reduced to structure factors after due corrections for absorption and Lorentz and polarization effects. The lattice parameters of these compounds were determined by least-squares refinement using 2θ values of 25 strong reflections in the range 2030° and MoKR (λ ) 0.71073 Å) on the four-circle diffractometer. Powder X-ray Diffraction. The X-ray powder diffraction profiles were measured using a Rigaku RINT2550 diffractometer (operating conditions 40 kV, 200 mA) with CuKR radiation equipped with a curved graphite monochromator. The d spacing measurements were performed at 2.0° (2θ) min-1 in the range of 10° < 2θ < 80° using powdered single crystals. Lattice parameters were calculated by a least-squares method. Magnetic Measurements. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility was measured with a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS) in a temperature (15) Takahashi, Y.; Akimoto, J.; Gotoh, Y.; Dokko, K.; Nishizawa, M.; Uchida, I.

Diamagnetic corrections for magnetic susceptibilities were taken into account. Results and Discussion LiMnO2. Black, needlelike LiMnO2 single crystals of about 0.15 × 0.03 × 0.02 mm3 in average were obtained, as shown in Figure 2. EDX analysis showed that the crystals were free from platinum contamination from the vessel. The chemical formula, analyzed by ICP, was Li1.0Mn1.0O2, which is consistent with the result of the present structure refinement. Precession photographs indicate the as-grown LiMnO2 belongs to the orthorhombic system with the space group Pmnm, as in the previous work.7 Figure 3 shows the {h0l}* and {0kl}* precession photographs of the LiMnO2 single crystal, taken at room temperature. No additional spots indicating the ordered structure and diffuse scattering could be observed in these photographs. The lattice parameters for the as-grown LiMnO2 were identical with those in the previous report.7,16 The structure refinement for orthorhombic LiMnO2 was carried out with the atomic coordinates reported in the literature.7 The converged final R and wR values and other experimental and crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. Difference Fourier syntheses using the final atomic parameters showed no significant residual peaks. The final atomic coordinates and displacement parameters are given in Table 2. All calculations were carried out using the Xtal3.4 package program.21 The refined structural parameters are in excellent agreement with those in the previous reports for LiMnO2.7 Magnetic susceptibility was measured as a function of temperature at fixed fields using the present LiMnO2 single-crystal samples. Figure 4 shows a typical temperature dependence from 5 to 300 K at 100 Oe. The open and filled marks correspond to measurements on field cooling and on heating after zero-field cooling, respectively. The history dependence of temperature versus M/H maximum below 50 K was clearly observed. Similar features were observed previously in the LiMnO2 polycrystalline sample.22 From the results of the present structural and magnetic characterization, we confirmed that the present single-crystal sample had a stoichiometric LiMnO2 chemical composition. LixMnO2 (x < 0.1). Figure 5 shows a SEM photograph of the electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 single crystal. Compared with that of the parent LiMnO2, the crystal becomes fragile, and there are many surface grooves parallel to the needle direction. The color of the crystals changed from black to brown by Li+ extraction. (20) Dokko, K.; Nishizawa, M.; Mohamedi, M.; Umeda, M.; Uchida, I.; Akimoto, J.; Takahashi, Y.; Gotoh, Y.; Mizuta, S.

The chemical formula of the electrochemically delithiated single crystal was roughly estimated (from the OCP value) to be Li0.1MnO2. The chemical composition of the chemically delithiated crystals, analyzed by ICP, was Li0.06Mn1.0O2. The value is well consistent with that obtained by the electrochemical delithiation. The chemical formula of both the electrochemically and chemically delithiated compounds is hereafter denoted as LixMnO2, where the lithium content, x, is less than 0.1. Precession photographs indicate the average structure of the electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 belongs to the cubic system with the space group Fm3hm. Figure 6 shows the {hk0}* and {hhl}* precession photographs of the electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 single crystal, taken at room temperature. Some additional spots indicating the superlattice structure and diffuse scattering could be observed in these photographs (Figure 7). This fact suggests the ordered local structure or short-range ordering in the single crystal specimen, as previously observed by electron diffraction study.9 However, these reflections were very weak in intensity compared with the main Bragg reflections. Therefore, we can describe the average structure as disordered rocksalt-type. The lattice parameter for the cubic rocksalt-type structure model was determined to be a ) 4.095 (3) Å using a four-circle diffractometer. The value is considerably different from those in the disordered rocksalt-type MnO (a ) 4.446(1) Å) and the spinel-type λ-MnO2 (a ) 4.02 × 2 Å).23,24 The structure refinement for the electrochemically delithiated LixMnO2 was carried out with the disordered rocksalt-type atomic coordinates and the space group Fm3hm. The converged final R and wR values and other experimental and crystallographic data are summarized in Table 3.

The refined occupancy parameter for Mn, the value of which is 48%, is well consistent with the chemical analysis. The derived Mn-O distance of 2.048(2) Å is longer than that expected for Mn4+. However this can be explained by about 50% vacancy of the Mn site. Figure 8 compares the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of as-grown orthorhombic LiMnO2 crystals and the chemically delithiated LixMnO2 crystals. The cubic lattice parameter of LixMnO2, determined by a leastsquares refinement using the powder data, was a ) 4.088(6) Å. As in the present single-crystal X-ray study, the (111) peak of the cubic spinel structure at around 19° in 2θ could not be observed in this pattern. Therefore, the average structure of the chemically delithiated sample also can be described as the disordered rocksalttype structure. Magnetic susceptibility was measured as a function of temperature at fixed fields using the chemically delithiated LixMnO2 single-crystal samples. Figure 9 shows a typical temperature dependence from 5 to 300 K at 100 Oe. The open and filled marks correspond to measurements on field cooling and on heating after zerofield cooling, respectively.

Mater., Vol. 15, No. 15, 2003 Akimoto et al. at 24 K in the ZFC magnetization, and an abrupt increase of the FC magnetization is noticeable with decreasing temperature below 50 K, indicating the presence of a ferromagnetic component. The origin of the ferromagnetic component in LixMnO2 is not clear. The complex magnetic behavior may come from the contribution of 90° Mn4+-O2--Mn4+ ferromagnetic interaction reported by Blasse.25 However, as ferromagnetism is also observed in the parent LiMnO2 (Figure 4),22 it may be caused by a small amount of magnetic impurity. To confirm this phenomenon, further magnetic properties below 24 K should be measured using higher quality samples. The inverse susceptibility is plotted in Figure 10, including a Curie-Weiss law fit to the data above 150 K. The extracted Weiss temperature and Curie constant are θ ) -158 K and C ) 2.00 emu K/mol, respectively. A negative Weiss temperature indicates antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn4+ spins. From the Curie constant, the effective moment is determined to be μeff ) 4.00 μB, which is slightly larger than the theoretical spin only value of 3.87 μB for Mn4+ (S ) 3/2). This fact is consistent with the chemical analysis results that show a lithium content of 6%, which implies an equivalent concentration of Mn3+ (S ) 2). Previously, Greedan et al. reported μeff ) 3.97 μB for the spinel-type λ-MnO2 samples prepared by a similar chemical delithiation technique.24 From these facts, we can be fairly certain that a novel disordered rocksalt-type MnO2 can be prepared by delithiation from the orthorhombic LiMnO2.

Because of the characteristic and anisotropic morphology of the starting single-crystal specimen, we have successfully pursued the mechanism of structural transformation by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction photographs. The parent orthorhombic LiMnO2 has a zigzag layered structure, as mentioned above (Figure 1). On the other hand, this structure can be also described as a cubic closest packing for oxygen atoms, in which both of the Li and Mn atoms occupy the octahedral O6 interstices. Figure 11 shows the rocksalt-type atomic arrangement in the parent LiMnO2 structure. Each view direction in Figure 11(a) and (b) corresponds to the X-ray photographs shown in Figure 3(a) and (b), respectively. Similarly, the ideal rocksalt-type atomic arrays (Figure 12(a) and (b)) correspond to the directions of the X-ray photographs of the electrochemically delithiated single crystal shown in Figure 6(a) and (b), respectively. It should be emphasized that we have taken the X-ray photographs (Figures 3 and 4) from the same direction to the crystal shape (Figures 2 and 5). Namely, the incident directions of X-ray to the characteristic crystal faces in Figure 11(a) and (b) are the same as those in Figure 12(a) and (b), respectively. From these facts, we can easily understand that this structure change is not caused by oxygen rearrangement and has been achieved by the migration of not only all of the lithium ions but also half of the manganese ions, as summarized in Figure 13. First, all of the Li+ migrates out of the lattice by the electrochemical potential, resulting in the formation of vacant octahedral sites (gray arrows in Figure 13). Then, half of the manganese ions migrate statistically into the vacant octahedral sites (black arrows in Figure 13). Accordingly, the migration of metal ions has accompanied a slight shift for oxygen atoms to the ideal CCP positions, resulting in the cubic symmetry. We think that the manganese ion migration could be caused by the structural instability of the “zigzag layered MnO2”. Conclusion The present single-crystal X-ray diffraction study revealed the structure change together with lithium extraction reaction from the parent orthorhombic zigzaglayered LiMnO2 structure to the cubic disordered rocksalt-type LixMnO2 with x < 0.1. The single-crystal to single-crystal transformation has been confirmed by the single-crystal X-ray precession method. The disordered rocksalt-type structure was previously predicted from a viewpoint of crystallographic phase transformation. In the present study, the metastable phase has been obtained as a single-crystal form for the first time. On the other hand, low-temperature synthetic techniques called “chimie douce” have resulted in major developments in the solid state chemistry of transition metal oxides. The systematic study of oxide bronzes in the period 1950-1980 paved the way to further advances in the solid state chemistry of oxides, including the alkali metal intercalation-deintercalation chemistry by soft chemistry or electrochemical methods. These techniques also gave access to new metastable compounds such as λ-MnO226 and several new forms of TiO2.27-29 In the present study, we report a novel disordered rocksalt-type manganese dioxide, prepared by the electrochemical and chemical delithiation from the parent orthorhombic LiMnO2. It should be noted that it is not clear from the present work whether the rocksalt-type form of MnO2 can be stabilized without finite amounts of Li+, as in the case of λ-MnO2. The superlattice spots and diffuse scattering observed in the present single-crystal X-ray study may be caused by the remaining lithium ions. Further soft chemical studies for the LiMnO2 crystals and polycrystalline samples should be carried out. We believe that the disordered rocksalt-type structure is a key to understanding the good and stable characteristics of the charge-discharge cycles in the LiMnO2 electrodes for the battery use.

Thomas Inorganic Chemistry, Ångstro ̈m Laboratory, Uppsala University, Box 538, SE-751 21 Uppsala, Sweden Received January 27, 1998. Revised Manuscript Received March 11, 1998 The structures of deuterated, protonated, and relithiated forms of MnO2 spinel, obtained by ion exchange of Li ions with D or H in a well-crystallized spinel Li1.27Mn1.73O4 compound, have been determined by powder neutron diffraction. Refinements were carried out using the Rietveld method of powder profile analysis in the space group Fd3m. Li ions are removed from both tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites when Li1.27Mn1.73O4 is contacted with DCl or HCl solution. The neutron diffraction data show that deuterium and hydrogen ions are predominantly incorporated into the crystal as -OD and -OH by bonding to lattice oxygen atoms without any other major change to the MnO2 spinel structure. The -OD and -OH groups are directed into the interstitial space of the 8a tetrahedra, but with an orientation which suggests that the deuteron or proton site is favored for occupation only when the nearest neighbor octahedral 16d site contains no Mn ion. When the protonated compound is contacted with LiOH solution, reinserted Li ions relocate on tetrahedral 8a sites in preference to vacant octahedral 16d sites in the MnO2 framework. Introduction Spinel-phase lithium manganates are three-dimensional insertion compounds with a high specificity for lithium.1-15 The structure of spinel LiMn2O4, shown schematically in Figure 1, can be described in the Fd3m space group in terms of a cubic close-packed array of oxygen ions in 32e sites. Manganese ions occupy half of the octahedral interstices (the 16d sites), forming a three-dimensional framework of edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra. Lithium ions occupy one-eighth of the tetrahedral interstices (the 8a sites). Extraction of lithium from LiMn2O4 by chemical or electrochemical * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ spinels are currently of special interest because of their high theoretical capacity for lithium insertion.27-32 The high hydrogen content of the delithiated phases, up to 0.8 H per Mn, has also attracted attention to their properties as protonic oxides.12 Determination of the proton insertion mechanism and the protonic species present in the lattice is therefore of fundamental importance for developing applications. Spectroscopic studies have indicated that both hydroxyl groups and water form in manganese oxide spinel lattices when hydrogen is inserted.11,12 However, the positions of the hydrogen atoms have not yet been determined directly. We present here chemical and neutron powder diffraction data for protonated and deuterated MnO2 compounds obtained by acid delithiation of a wellcrystallized spinel Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ phase prepared using a novel high-temperature synthesis, as well as data for the parent and relithiated phases. The objectives of this study were to characterize the structures and chemical properties of the compounds, to determine proton/ deuteron positions in the lattice, and to locate the sites for lithium sorption in the proton-form spinel. While neutron powder diffraction studies have been previously reported for Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ spinels prepared from lithium and manganese carbonates at 400 °C23 and from eutectic mixtures of lithium acetate and manganese nitrate heated at 500 and 700 °C,32 to our knowledge the data presented here are the first for protonated, deuterated, and chemically relithiated phases. The results complement and extend the conclusions of our recent studies using infrared and neutron spectroscopies,11,12 X-ray absorption spectroscopy,13,14 and atomistic simulations.33 Experimental Section Samples. Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ was prepared from a commercial γ-MnO2 product (Aldrich) by chemical insertion of lithium followed by oxidation and structural transformation through heating with oxygen. Five grams of γ-MnO2 was immersed in a 3-fold excess of 2.3 M LiI solution in acetonitrile and reacted at 70 °C for 7 h. According to reported data,34 these reaction conditions were expected to give a lithium-inserted LixMnO2 product with x > 0.5. The oxide product was separated from the solution and washed thoroughly with acetonitrile and acetone. Analysis for Li, Mn, and O gave a composition of Li0.74MnO2, and powder X-ray diffraction showed that the γ-MnO2 had retained its original structure but with some anisotropic expansion of the unit cell, in agreement with previously reported results.34 The oxide was then placed in flowing oxygen and heated at 2°/min to 700 °C, maintained at 700 °C for 36 h, and cooled slowly while maintaining the oxygen flow, to obtain the oxidized spinel phase. Heating followed by slow cooling under a flow of oxygen has been shown to favor a high oxygen and Mn4+ content in lithium manganate spinels, allowing higher temperatures to be used for the obtainment of better crystallinity.30-32 Well-crystallized Mn4+ lithium manganates are difficult to obtain in air due to the reduction of tetravalent Mn above 400 °C.22,35 Delithiation and proton insertion in the spinel lithium manganate to give protonated MnO2 were achieved by stirring a portion of the oxide powder in 0.5 M HCl for 3 days, followed by washing with distilled water. Deuterated MnO2 was obtained by delithiating a portion of the lithium manganate in 0.5 M DCl (37% DCl in D2O, Merck > 99% purity, diluted in D2O, Aldrich 99.9% purity) under dry nitrogen, followed by washing with D2O and drying under dynamic vacuum. The deuterated sample was maintained sealed under dry nitrogen throughout the neutron experiment. Lithium was reinserted (16) Thackeray, M. M.; David, W. I. F.; Bruce, P. G.; Goodenough, J. B. Mater.

Characterization of crystalline phases and calculation of unit cell parameters were initially performed from X-ray powder diffraction data recorded on a Philips diffractometer using Cu KR radiation. Lithium and manganese contents were determined by flame spectrometry, and the oxygen content, which provides the average manganese oxidation state n+Mn, by backtitrating samples dissolved in oxalic acid with permanganate solution.36 Lattice proton contents were estimated from the water loss between 100 and 300 °C,7,11 measured by thermogravimetry using an automated Stanton Redcroft STA-781 series thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. Neutron Data Collection. Neutron diffraction data were collected on the neutron powder diffractometer (NPD) at the steady-state research reactor R2 at the Neutron Research Laboratory, Studsvik, Sweden. A monochromator system with two copper crystals (220 reflection) in parallel alignment was used. Samples were contained in vanadium cans. Data for the parent lithium manganate compound and for the deuterated sample were collected at ambient temperature (295 K) in the 2θ range 4.00-129.92° using a neutron wavelength of 1.47 Å. Data for the protonated and relithiated samples were collected at 10 K in the 2θ range 4.00-139.92° using a neutron wavelength of 1.21 Å. The incoherent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectrum of the protonated MnO2 was recorded on the TFXA spectrometer at the spallation neutron source ISIS (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, U.K.). The sample was contained in aluminum foil, and data were collected at ca. 10 K for 2400 μAh. Structure Refinement. Structure refinements of the neutron diffraction data sets were based on the Rietveld method37 using the program Fullprof.38 The powder diffraction profiles used in the refinements covered the 2θ range 15.00129.92/139.92°. Neutron scattering lengths used were b(Li) ) -1.9 fm, b(H) ) -3.74 fm, b(D) ) 6.67 fm, b(Mn) ) -3.73 fm, and b(O) ) 5.80 fm. The diffraction peaks were described by a pseudo-Voigt function, in which the Lorentzian contribution to a Gaussian peak-shape was refined. Peak asymmetry corrections were made for angles below 45° in 2θ. The angular dependence of the line widths was expressed by H2 ) U tan2 θ + V tan θ + W, where H is the full width at half-maximum, θ is the Bragg angle, and U, V, and W are refinable parameters. Absorption effects were corrected by using the value μR ) 0.24 experimentally determined from transmission measurements at 2θ ) 0°. Background intensities were described by the polynomial expression yi ) ∑Bm(2θi/90 1)m, where 0 e m e 5. The Bm coefficients for m ) 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were refined together with one zero-point refinement parameter. For each sample, the scale factor, lattice parameter, and atomic position parameter for oxygen were refined for the cubic phase in the space group Fd3m. Manganese ions were constrained to 16d octahedral sites, in accordance with diffraction and X-ray absorption data for spinel lithium manganates.13,23,32,39 Oxygen, manganese, and lithium contents were fixed to the mean values determined from the chemical analyses. The thermal displacement parameters B for the different sites in the parent Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ compound were refined. To determine the amount of deuterium in the deuterated sample, the B parameters of all other atoms were fixed at the values refined for the parent compound. This is valid since the data were collected at the same temperature for both samples. In view of the correlation between occupancy factors and displacement parameters, the B parameter for deuterium was fixed at the same value as that for 8a lithium atoms. Allowing the deuterium B value to vary in a final stage had no significant effect, either on the refined deuterium occupancy or on the other structural parameters; therefore, the fixed value was retained. Refinement of the data for the protonated sample was carried out in the same way as for the deuterated sample, but the displacement parameters for the manganese and oxygen atoms were refined because of the lower data collection temperature. The values of the displacement parameters for the lithium and hydrogen atoms were fixed at B ) 1.0 Å2, scaled to 1.6 times the refined oxygen value to maintain the same relationship between the B values as that used for the deuterated compound. Again, allowing the hydrogen B parameter to vary did not affect the other structural parameters or the refinement agreement factors. For the relithiated (H)MnO2 compound, the displacement parameters for oxygen and manganese were refined together with the coordinates and occupancy factors for the remaining protons. Results and Discussion X-ray Diffraction and Chemical Characterization. The unit cell parameters calculated from the X-ray diffraction patterns and the chemical compositions determined by the chemical and thermal analyses are given in Table 1 for the parent, deuterated, protonated, and relithiated samples. The parent compound, after heating under oxygen flow, had a Li/Mn ratio of 0.73 and a high O/Mn content (n+Mn ) 3.95). This gives values of x ) 0.27 and δ ) 0.05 if the composition is expressed in the notation Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ. The XRD pattern showed sharp diffraction peaks for a single spinel phase with a unit cell parameter a0 ) 8.159(2) Å. The unit cell parameters of spinel lithium manganates are highly correlated with the manganese oxidation state,22,35 and a value of 8.159 Å is consistent with the high Mn4+ content determined by chemical analysis. We note that there was no evidence in the XRD pattern for the parasitic rock-salt phase Li2MnO3 which often forms at the surface of spinel particles when high Li/ Mn ratios are used in the preparation.35 The high phase purity of the spinel can be attributed to the atomic-level mixing of lithium and manganese in the γ-MnO2 pre(36) Katz, M.

Mater., Vol. 10, No. 6, 1998 Ammundsen et al. cursor, in which the lithium is dispersed by chemical insertion into specific crystallographic sites. The products obtained by acid leaching in HCl and DCl solutions were single-phase cubic spinels with unit cell parameters of 8.069(3) and 8.063(2) Å. The compositional analyses showed that ca. 95% of the lithium had been extracted in both cases. The high Mn4+ content and phase purity of the parent lithium manganate compound was expected to favor a high level of proton or deuteron exchange for lithium. This expectation was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis which showed a 7% weight loss attributable to lattice water7,11 in the compounds after treatment in HCl and DCl, corresponding to a H(D)/Mn ratio of ca. 0.74, i.e., very close to the Li/Mn ratio of the parent lithium manganate. An increase of the manganese oxidation state to ca. 4.0 in both cases indicates disproportionation of the small amount of Mn3+ which was present in the parent lithium manganate according to the redox mechanism (reaction 1), which would also have contributed to a small fraction of the total lithium extraction. In LiOH solution, the (H)MnO2 compound sorbed Li ions to give a single relithiated phase containing ca. 56% of the lithium content of the original parent compound. The difference between the proton contents of the (H)MnO2 and the relithiated phase, as determined by thermogravimetry, corresponded closely to the amount of lithium reinserted, indicating that the reinsertion took place by a lithium-proton exchange mechanism. Consequently, ca. 40% of the protons inserted during delithiation remained in the relithiated material. It is noteworthy that the unit cell parameter of the relithiated phase, 8.184(3) Å, was significantly higher than that of the parent lithium manganate. This correlates with a Mn3+ content in the relithiated compound which is markedly higher than that of the original parent phase. This reduction of lattice manganese to Mn3+ does not appear to be associated with lithium reinsertion, since practically all the reinserted lithium can be accounted for by lithium-proton exchange. It appears to be the result of some surface disproportionation of Mn4+ in the hydroxide solution, which also produced dissolved permanganate ions. As a result, the relithiated spinel compound is slightly oxygen-deficient relative to its precursor phases. Analysis of the Neutron Diffraction Data. The observed and calculated neutron diffraction profiles of the four samples are shown in Figure 2. The refined crystallographic parameters are given in Table 2, and the refined cation distributions are summarized in Table 3. Bond angles and interatomic distances in the structures are given in Table 4. The excess oxygen content of the parent compound, δ ) 0.05, implies that the spinel structure contained a fraction of cation vacancies. The Mn/O stoichiometry leaves ca. 15% of the 16d octahedral sites unoccupied by manganese. The best agreement between the calculated and observed data during refinement was obtained when all these remaining 16d octahedral sites were filled with lithium but only 96% of the 8a tetrahedral sites were occupied. Difference Fourier maps confirmed that the 8a and 16d sites were preferred for lithium compared to the 16c site. The cation distribution is therefore similar to that determined from neutron Figure 2.

For both compounds the difference Fourier maps indicated the presence of some lithium in 8a tetrahedral sites. The small amounts of lithium remaining in the compounds were therefore refined fully in that position. Attempts to refine any lithium on the vacant 16d octahedral sites led to significantly worse fits to the experimental data. Refinement of the neutron diffraction profile for the deuterated MnO2 sample confirmed the presence of deuterium atoms in ordered positions.

Figure 3. Contour plots of the Fourier difference calculations for the deuterium-exchanged MnO2 (a) before and (b) after inclusion of deuterium in the refinement, indicating the presence of deuterium atoms in the interstitial space of the 8a tetrahedron (section at height x ) 0.20 perpendicular to the ab-plane; arbitrary contour interval). 1684 Chem. Mater., Vol. 10, No. 6, 1998 Ammundsen et al. showed positive residual peaks in 96g sites ca. 1 Å from the oxygen atoms. Deuterium was therefore refined at these sites to give good agreement between the calculated and observed data. The difference Fourier map at this stage showed no other pronounced features (Figure 3b). The [111] peak at ca. 19° in 2θ could be reproduced only when deuterium was included in the refinements at the 96g sites in the MnO2 structure. Refinement of the hydrogen positions in the protonated MnO2 compound using the 96g deuterium coordinates as a starting point also produced a significantly better fit between the calculated and experimental profiles for this compound than initial refinements which included only oxygen, manganese, and lithium. The final hydrogen position was identical within the 3σ limit to that of the deuterium in the deuterated MnO2. Loss of oxygen from the protonated MnO2 compound during relithiation resulted in a small loss of cation vacancies and a corresponding increase in the fraction of 16d octahedral sites occupied by manganese. The total negative scattering in 16d sites was consistent with the presence of manganese only, and attempts to refine lithium in these sites produced negative site occupancy factors. It was concluded that reinserted lithium was in 8a tetrahedral sites only. A small amount of hydrogen was also refined in the same site as that determined for the protonated MnO2 before relithiation. Structural Model for Hydrogen and Deuterium in Spinel MnO2. The 96g position refined for the protons and deuterons is related to the 32e oxygen site in the spinel structure as illustrated in Figure 4. In a regular (Li)8a[Mn2]16dO4 spinel, oxygen is on a 3-fold axis of symmetry which lies along the O-Li bond. There are three equivalent proton (deuteron) sites for each oxygen distributed around this axis at O-H(D) distances of 1.1 Å. In these positions, the protons (deuterons) are directed toward the three oxygen atoms defining the opposite corners of the 8a tetrahedron, displaced off the OsO lines by ca. 19°. A maximum of only one proton (deuteron) can be bonded to any oxygen, as two protons (deuterons) attached to the same oxygen would give rise to unreasonably short H-H or D-D distances of 0.62 Å. The hydrogen and deuterium observed in this site can therefore be assigned to -OH and -OD groups directed in one of three equivalent orientations into the 8a tetrahedral space of the spinel interstitial channels. There are twelve 96g proton (deuteron) sites neighboring each 8a tetrahedral site, but only ca. 5% of these appear to be occupied in the structure. Those 8a tetrahedra containing residual lithium ions will be excluded from occupation of any of the twelve sites, as this would correspond to a short Li-H(D) distance of ca. 0.9 Å. Nevertheless, the chemical analyses for lithium content and manganese oxidation state in the protonated and deuterated phases indicated that ca. 1.1 H (or D) had been inserted per spinel formula unit, supported by thermogravimetric analyses which showed up to 0.64 mol of lattice water in these compounds. If all this inserted H (D) was to form hydroxyl (deuterioxyl) with lattice oxygen, at least 20% of the vacant 8a tetrahedra would be required to accommodate two hydroxyl or deuterioxyl species. However, it may be noted that the simultaneous occupation of more than one of the twelve sites in a vacant 8a tetrahedron would give rise to close H-H or D-D interactions of between 1.00 and 1.75 Å. Therefore, if two hydroxyl or deuterioxyl groups were to form around the same 8a interstice, the H or D atoms might be expected to be displaced off these sites, producing disordering effects and resulting in the calculation of a reduced site occupancy from the diffraction data. The difference between the inserted H (D) content determined by chemical and thermogravimetric analyses and the occupancies calculated for the 96g sites from the diffraction data (ca. 0.6 H per formula unit) might be partly attributed to such a disordering effect. Complementary data concerning the protonic species in the protonated MnO2 compound were obtained from the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectrum shown in Figure 5. The essential characteristics of the spectrum of this sample, prepared by the novel highertemperature route, are the same as those observed in the INS spectra of proton-exchanged Li1.33Mn1.67O4 compounds prepared at 400 °C.11 The spectrum is dominated by one intense peak at 908 cm-1 assigned to the γ(OH) deformation mode of a hydroxyl group11,12 which indicates, in agreement with the diffraction data, that the majority of protons inserted into the compound form hydroxide ions located in one type of site. Scattering between 300 and 700 cm-1 corresponds to vibrations of [MnO6] octahedra which would be activated in INS if the hydrogen atoms were carried with the vibrating oxygen atoms, confirming that the hydroxide ions are located in the MnO2 framework. The O-H(D) distance of 1.1 Å determined from the neutron refinements may be compared to similar values determined for deuterioxyl and hydroxyl groups in Figure 4. Schematic representation of an 8a tetrahedral interstice in hydrogenor deuterium-exchanged MnO2 spinel, showing the 96g H (D) sites determined from the neutron diffraction data. The 96g site is considered to be occupied when the near 16d site at 2.45 Å distance is vacant. Ion Exchange in Manganese Dioxide Spinel Chem. Mater., Vol. 10, No. 6, 1998 1685 chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides.40-43 However, the O-H(D) and O-H(D)‚‚‚O distances should be regarded as upper limits to the actual values, since oxygen atoms are likely to be slightly relaxed from their average positions when a deuterium or hydrogen atom is attached. Nonetheless, only weak hydrogen bonding to the neighboring oxygen would be expected for O-H(D)‚‚‚O distances > 3 Å, which is consistent with the relatively low energy of the OH deformation mode at 908 cm-1. Indeed, the low wavenumber of this mode in spectroscopic data for protonated lithium manganate spinels prepared at 400 °C led to an earlier prediction that hydroxyl groups in spinel MnO2 would be orientated toward the neighboring oxygen across the 8a tetrahedral site, as other orientations would lead to stronger hydrogen bond interactions and give rise to deformation modes at higher frequencies.11 The orientation determined here by neutron diffraction supports such an analysis. The neutron diffraction data can afford no direct information as to whether the hydroxyl (deuterioxyl) groups are randomly distributed in the structure or ordered in some respect with regard to the host MnO2 lattice. However, it is significant that these data show that ca. 15% of the 16d octahedral sites are vacant in the delithiated phases. Chemical analyses have shown that insertion of protons in spinel MnO2 is systematically correlated with the presence of 16d octahedral vacancies in the MnO2 host framework.7,12,15 The 16d vacancies are expected to induce local electronic and structural perturbations in the lattice, particularly affecting the octahedron of six oxygen atoms surrounding the vacant site. These oxygen atoms, coordinated to only two rather than three Mn ions, will also be more basic sites for the formation of chemical bonds with hydrogen than oxygen atoms not localized at Mn vacancies. Table 4 shows that one of the three 16d octahedral sites neighboring each proton (deuteron) position is at a relatively close distance of 2.45 Å to the H(D) atom. Orientation of the hydroxyl or deuterioxyl in this position should therefore be considered unfavorable with regard to a close Mn‚‚‚H(D) interaction, if the 16d site is occupied by manganese. On the other hand, this orientation would actually be favored if the near 16d site in the local structure were indeed one of the ca. 15% unoccupied sites. In support of these conclusions, recent modeling of the spinel MnO2 lattice using atomistic simulation methods has predicted that the absence of a cation in one of the three neighboring 16d sites would favor the formation of hydroxyl groups in the local structure, and would result in a preferential orientation of the hydroxyl proton into nearly the same site as that determined here from the neutron data.33 To further test this structural model, the frequency of the γ(OH) mode was calculated for the hydroxyl proton located in the position determined from the neutron data, both with all three neighboring 16d sites occupied by manganese and with a vacancy in the 16d site at 2.45 Å from the proton [B. Ammundsen and M. S. Islam, unpublished; calculations were performed using GULP (General Utility Lattice Programme), developed by J. D. Gale, Royal Institution of GB and Imperial College, London, 1991-1997]. With all three neighboring 16d sites occupied by manganese ions, the frequency of the γ(OH) mode was calculated as 990 cm-1. However, when the Mn ion in the 16d site at 2.45 Å from the proton was removed, the calculation gave a frequency of 906 cm-1, in excellent agreement with the observed vibration at 908 cm-1. Finally, it has been observed that reinsertion of lithium into protonated spinel MnO2 compounds results in the disappearance of the lattice hydroxyl mode at 908 cm-1 from the vibrational spectrum.12 The neutron diffraction data presented here show that lithium ions are reinserted preferentially into 8a tetrahedral sites. The disappearance of the hydroxyl vibration with reinsertion of lithium is therefore explained; simultaneous occupation of the 8a tetrahedron by lithium and hydroxyl is excluded by a prohibitively close Li-H distance. The hydrogen atoms remaining in the relithiated MnO2 phase after the incomplete reexchange with lithium ions as seen by neutron diffraction, other than those occupying positions neighboring the small fraction of 8a sites which remain vacant, could not be located from the diffraction data. Previous studies suggest that the nonexchanged hydrogen remaining in the relithiated structure of MnO2 is predominantly in the form of disordered structural water.12 Conclusions The method of synthesis described here produces wellcrystallized Li1+xMn2-xO4+δ compounds with high phase purity, which take up high amounts of deuteron and proton during the extraction of lithium from both 8a tetrahedral and 16d octahedral sites in acid solution. The proton/deuteron sites identified by neutron diffraction in the spinel MnO2 structure are located in the three-dimensional interstitial channel space, and correspond to hydroxyl or deuterioxyl groups oriented toward neighboring oxygen atoms along the edge of the (40) Christensen, A.

These sites appear to be favored for occupation when the nearest neighboring 16d octahedral site has also been vacated by the extraction of a lithium ion. The chemical and structural data demonstrate the key relationship between the occupied cation sites in a spinel lithium manganate and its chemical properties with regard to lithium-proton exchange. Development of lithium manganates for proton insertion and ion-exchange applications therefore requires a knowledge of the cation distribution of the lattice framework and its optimization to induce the desired chemical properties.

Goodenough) ABSTRACT Lithium-manganese-oxides prepared at moderate temperatures are under investigation as insertion electrodes for rechargeable lithium batteries. The structures of two defectspinel compounds synthesised by the reaction of MnCO 3 and Li2CO 3 at 400°C are reported. The cation distributions in the structures were determined by neutrondiffraction to be {Li.~srl.xs}8,[MnL74Li.z6116aO 4 and {Li.87Vl.x3}~[Mnl.7xLi.zg]l~O4, where 8a and 16d refer to the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the prototypic spinel space group Fd3m, respectively. The structures are discussed in relation to the spinel system Li20. yMnO 2 (y_>2.5). MATERIALS INDEX: lithium, manganese, oxides, spinels INTRODUCTION Lithium-manganese-oxides with a spinel-type structure are of interest as insertion electrodes for rechargeable lithium battery applications [1,2]. The best-known material is Li[Mn2]O 4 which has space group symmetry Fd3m; it is isostructural with the prototype mineral spinel Mg[Alz]O 4. In Li[Mn2]O 4 the lithium ions occupy the tetrahedral 8a sites and the manganese ions the octahedral 16d sites. The oxygen ions, which are cubic-closepacked, occupy the 32e positions. Lithium insertion into Li[Mn2]O 4 causes a displacement of the Li + ions from the 8a positions into neighbouring interstitial 16c octahedral sites to yield Li2[Mn2]O 4 after the insertion of one lithium per spinel unit [3,4]. A neutrondiffraction analysis of Li2[Mn2]O4 has shown that the Li + ions occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites [5]. Lithium extraction from Li[Mnz]O 4 produces the defect spinel 1041 1042 M.M. THACKERAY et al. Vol. 28, No. 10 ~.-MnO 2 [6]. The [Mn~]O 4 spinel framework remains intact during both lithium insertion and extraction; ~.-MnO 2 retains the cubic symmetry of the parent compound whereas the onset of a Jahn-Teller distortion in Lil+x[Mn2]O 4 at x=0.08, when the average Mn valency is 3.46, reduces the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal [3]. Electrochemical extraction of lithium from Li[Mn2]O 4 occurs in two stages at approximately 4V, whereas lithium is inserted into Li[Mn2]O 4 to a composition Li2[Mnz]O 4 at a constant voltage of 2.9V [3,7]. Although the reversibility of the higher voltage reaction is good, lithium cells show a significant capacity loss when cycled on the 2.9V plateau [1,8]. The loss in capacity is believed to be mainly a result of the JahnTeller distortion that causes a 16% increase in the c/a ratio of the unit cell during the insertion and extraction of lithium. Li[Mn2]O 4 electrodes therefore have limited use in rechargeable 3V lithium cells. It was recently reported that Li[Mn2]O 4 could be oxidized to form an oxygen-rich, defect spinel LiMn2045 (Li2Mn409) [9]. Li2Mn409 is an intermediate member of the LizO-yMnO z system (y_>2.5); it has y=4.0. The end members of the system are the stoichiometric spinel Li4MnsO u (y=2.5) and the defect spinel ~.-MnO 2 (y=~o). Of particular interest are the spinels that fall within the compositional range 2.5_<y_<4.0 because they operate far more effectively than Li[Mn2]O 4 as electrodes in rechargeable 3V lithium cells [1]. They have the following attractive features: 1) 2) 3) LizO.yMnO 2 compounds (2.5<y<4.0) can be synthesised within a few hours by reacting Li2CO 3 (or LiOH) with MnCO 3 at 400°C, the theoretical capacities of these spinel electrodes (in which all the manganese ions are tetravalent), for example, Li2Mn409 (213mAh/g) and Li4MnsOl2 (163mAh/g) are higher than the capacity of Li[Mn2]O 4 (148mAh/g), and Li/LizO.yMnO 2 cells are significantly more stable on cycling than Li/Li[Mn2]O 4 cells. The superior cycling has been attributed to the fact that lithium is inserted into cubic LizO-yMnO 2 spinel structures with minimal increase in unit-cell volume and that the Jahn-Teller effect (tetragonal distortion) occurs late in the discharge reaction when the average valency of the manganese ions reaches approximately 3.5. There is currently little information about the structures of Li20 • yMnO 2 spinel products made by the solid state reaction of Li2CO 3 and MnCO 3 at moderate temperatures. In this paper our attempts to prepare two single-phase spinel compounds within the range 2.5_<y_<4.0, namely Li4MnsO12 (y=2.5) and LizMn307 (y=3) at 400°C are reported. The structures of the resulting products as determined by neutron diffraction are discussed in relation to LizMn409 (y=4) and a standard ~.-MnO 2 (y=oo) sample. EXPERIMENTAL A standard ~.-MnO 2 sample (sample A) was prepared by Hunter's method by reacting LiMn204 in 2M H2SO 4 at 20°C for 16 hours [6]. Two other spinel compounds, labelled sample B and sample C were prepared by the reaction of Li2CO 3 and MnCO 3 powders. Li:Mn ratios of 2:3 and 4:5 were selected for samples B and C in anticipation of synthesising single-phase LizMn307 and Li4Mn5012 products, respectively. The powders were thoroughly mixed, prior to firing, by ball-milling in hexane in sealed ceramic Vol. 28, No. 10 SPINELS 1043 containers for several days. After evaporating the hexane at room temperature, 30g samples were manually reground and fired at 400°C in air. Samples for neutron diffraction analysis were heated for 20 hours. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected on samples that had been heated for only 5 hours to demonstrate the speed at which spinel compounds can be synthesised by solid state reactions at moderate temperature. The lithium and manganese concentrations in the fired samples were determined by atomic absorption methods. These analyses showed that there had been no loss of lithium during synthesis (Table 1); the lithium content in sample B was, in fact, slightly higher than expected. TABLE 1 Li:Mn ratios of samples B and C before and after firing at 400°C as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Sample Li:Mn before firing B 2.00:3.00 C 4.00:5.00 Li:Mn after firing 2.03:3.00 4.25:5.00 X-ray diffraction data of the samples were collected at the CSIR on an automated Rigaku diffractometer. The beam of CuKa radiation was monochromated with a graphite single crystal. Structures were determined by profile refinement of time-of-flight neutrondiffraction data collected on the Polaris diffractometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Peak shape was defined by a double-decay exponential, convoluted with a Voigt function [10,11]. Neutron-scattering amplitudes used in the refinements were b(Li)= -.203xl0-mcm, b(Mn)= -.373x10-a2cm and b(O)= .5804x10XZcm [12]. In the refinements of the spinel structures the tetrahedral sites were assumed to be occupied by only lithium ions because Mn 3÷ (d 4) and Mn 4+ (d 3) ions favour octahedral, not tetrahedral, coordination. Because both lithium and manganese ions can occupy the 16d octahedral sites of the spinel structure, the cation distribution was determined in accordance with the composition that was closest to the expected stoichiometry and that was consistent with the overall negative scattering from these sites. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The observed and calculated neutron-diffraction profiles of samples A, B and C are shown in Figs. 1(a-c). The refined eystallographic parameters of the three defect spinel structures are given in Tables 2(a-c). Sample A: "2-Mn02" An excellent fit between the observed and calculated data was obtained for the standard ~.-MnO 2 sample (Fig. 1). The refinement was consistent with other reported refinements [4,6]; it showed, in particular, a small amount of scattering from residual lithium (5%) in the tetrahedral 8a sites and that the octahedral 16d sites were fully occupied by manganese. The refined composition of this phase, in spinel notation, {Lio.osl-'lo.gs}ga[Mn2116aO4, gave an average valency of 3.975 for the manganese ions. The lattice parameter a=8.0445(1)/~ is marginally larger than values reported for other "~.M " nO 2 samples, for example, a=8.03/~ [6] and a=8.029/~ [4]. 1044 M.M. THACKERAY et al.

THACKERAY et al. Vol. 28, No. 10 Sample B: "Li2Mn307" The refined composition of Sample B, was determined to be, in spinel notation, {Li0.ssVI0.~}~[Mnl.74Li0.~]l~O 4. This composition, which is equivalent to Lil.94Mn3.040 7 (or Li20.3.13MnO1.9~ ), is in reasonably good agreement with the expected formula Li2Mn30 7 (or Li20.3.0MnO2). The model showed unequivocally that the spinel product was lithium-deficient with vacancies on the tetrahedral 8a sites. It also showed that the manganese ions were not quite fully oxidized (n+Mn=3.97). The small amount of surplus lithia (or unreacted Li2CO3) that was present in the sample could not be detected as a second phase in the neutron-diffraction pattern. The 16d octahedral sites were completely filled with lithium and manganese. It should be noted that it is possible to account for the total negative scattering from the octahedral sites by increasing the manganese to lithium ratio and introducing vacancies in these sites. However, because such calculations move the composition of the spinel phase further away from the expected stoichiometry, the preferred composition of sample B was deemed to be Lil.94Mn3.0407. Sample C: "Li4Mns012" The refinement of sample C yielded the spinel composition {Li0.s21:10.1s}8,[Mnl.70Li0.30104, or alternatively, Li3.36Mns.10O12. The refinement demonstrated that this spinel phase, like sample B, was lithium-deficient with vacancies on the tetrahedral 8a sites; the octahedral sites were completely filled with lithium and manganese. However, in this model the average valency of each manganese ion is 4.04 which marginally exceeds the fullyoxidized state of 4.0. The excess charge on the manganese can be compensated for by increasing, within the allowed limits of experimental error, the lithium content in the tetrahedral 8a sites and the manganese to lithium ratio in the octahedral 16d sites. The composition of the spinel phase, in which the manganese ions are exactly tetravalent, which most closely approximates that of Li4MnsO n is Li3.48Mn5.13012 , or in spinel notation, {Lio.sTl"10.13}sa[Mnl.71Li0.29]lalO 4. (The possibility that sample C, like sample B, may be very slightly oxygen deficient, cannot be entirely discounted). It is of interest to note that Li3.48Mns.130 4 can also be represented as Li20 • 2.95MNO 2 which, coincidently, is close to the composition that was anticipated for sample B, had the reaction gone to completion. The data at hand therefore show that, despite extremely well-mixed samples, the formation of single-phase Li4MnsO12 at moderate temperatures is hindered by the rapid decomposition and complete oxidation of MnCO 3 while only partly reacting with the Li20 component of Li2CO 3. It is anticipated that with longer reaction times a singlephase stoichiometric Li4Mn50 n product would be generated; the second stage of the reaction is expected to occur relatively slowly because it necessitates the physical incorporation of Li20 into an already fully-oxidized lithium-manganese-oxide structure. The cation distribution in the four spinel phases of the Li20 ° yMnO 2 system that have been characterized thus far by neutron diffraction are listed in Table 3. In the two end members of this system, ~.-MnO 2 and Li4MnsOI2, the octahedral 16d sites are completely filled; in ~.-MnO 2 the tetrahedral sites are empty whereas in LiaMn5012 they are filled with lithium. In LizMn40 9 (y=4), vacancies exist on both the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the structure [9]. As y decreases towards 2.5 it is evident that the octahedral sites are preferentially filled by lithium and that vacancies are retained on the tetrahedral sites. It has not been possible to synthesise defect spinels with y>4 by reaction of LizCO 3 Vol. 28, No. 10 SPINELS 1047 and MnCO 3 at 400°C because of the thermal instability of these phases. However, there are indications that these structures can be synthesised at room temperature by the removal of Li20 from Li20-yMnO 2 spinels (2.5_<y_<4.0) with acid [13]. It is anticipated from the trends in Table 3 that fully-oxidized Li20.yMnO 2 spinels with compositions between Li2Mn409 and ~-MnO 2 will have vacancies, like Li2Mn40 9, on both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The Li-O and Mn-O bond lengths in the defect spinel structures are consistent with those reported for structures with close-packed-oxygen arrays (Table 4). For the three Li20.yMnO 2 spinels in the rang.e 2.5<y_<4.0 there is no variation in the octahedral Mn(Li)-O bond distance (1.940A) whereas the tetrahedral Li-O distance decreases TABLE 3 The cation distribution, in spinel notation, in spinel phases from the Li20.yMnO 2 system.

THACKERAY et al. Vol. 28, No. 10 significantly with y. The bond distances in these cubic structures are dependent on several factors: 1) the lattice parameter a, 2) the oxygen positional coordinate (in spinels this is often referred to as the "u parameter" [14]), 3) the distribution of Li ÷ and Mn 4÷ cations in the octahedral sites, and 4) the concentration of vacancies on tetrahedral and octahedral sites. For example, in Li 005[Mn2]O4 (sample A) the significantly short Mn-O (1.912/~) and Li-O (1.924/~) distances can be attributed predominantly to strong Mn-O bonding that results from the total occupation of the 16d octahedral sites by manganese. In Li2Mn40 9 (1.959/~), the relatively large tetrahedral Li-O distance can be attributed to the existence of vacancies on both the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the structure and the relatively large values of a and u.

Vol. 28, No. i0 SPINELS 1049 spinel phases from one another by their lattice parameter values. However, there exist an infinite number of spinel compositions within the LiMn204-Li4MnsO12-MnO 2 tietriangle of the Li-Mn-O phase diagram [1] with lattice parameters that vary between 8.03/~ and 8.25/~ It is therefore impossible, in principle, to use only a lattice parameter value, or a visual inspection of an X-rayor neutron-diffraction pattern to identify a specific spinel phase in the Li-Mn-O system. CONCLUSIONS This study has demonstrated that lithium-manganese-oxide spinel compounds synthesised by the reaction of MnCO 3 and Li2CO 3 at 400°C tend to be lithium deficient. Although it has been possible with neutron-diffraction data to identify and determine the site occupancy of lithium on the tetrahedral 8a sites, the data cannot distinguish unambiguously between lithium and manganese on the octahedral 16d sites. Compositions of the spinel products were therefore determined from structural refinements that provide the closest fit to the expected stoichiometries. The refined compositions, the distribution of the manganese and lithium cations on the octahedral 16d sites, and the Li-O and Mn-O bond distances within the structures are consistent with the expected trends in the Li20 .yMnO 2 spinel system. Ideally, refinements of these structures should be undertaken in combination with high-quality X-ray data from which the site occupancy of the manganese ions on the 16d sites would be obtained with greater reliability because lithium is an extremely weak scatterer of X-rays.

INTRODUCTION A great deal of work has been done on compounds of the Li}Mn}O system, because of the peculiar applications of LiMn2O4 spinel and related phases in the "elds of electrochemistry (1}4) and catalysis (5}7). Both stoichiometric (lithium cationic fraction x"0.333) and nonstoichiometric spinel phases in samples with x'0.333 and x(0.333 (Li-rich and Li-poor samples, respectively) were recently studied. As a result, new structuralcalorimetric (8) and structural-spectroscopic (9, 10) data are now available on composition-related defects involving Li` ions. Samples can be obtained from the solid state reactive system MnO/Li2CO3 (11}13), or from di!erent reactive systems such as MnO2/Li2CO3 (14, 15) and MnO2/LiOH (16, 17) at temperature higher than 1000 K. 1To whom correspondence should be addressed. An alternative method to synthesize lithium manganese spinel at lower temperature is represented by the sol}gel route (1, 18, 19). Starting from aqueous solutions of LiOH and Mn(II) acetate as precursor, Barboux et al. (1) prepared LiMn2O4 at temperature as low as 573 K. Following such very soft conditions, the synthesis would lead to a very small particle size. A study of physical and chemical properties of such a phase as a function of the annealing conditions would be extremely interesting since electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility may be particularly sensitive to small changes of stoichiometry brought about by modifying the synthesis conditions. The "rst aim of the present paper was the study of structural and microstructural properties of the lithium manganese spinel phase obtained from sol}gel synthesis compared with the properties observed in samples obtained from a solid state process. Conductivity, electron paramagnetic resonance, and static magnetic susceptibility measurements were also performed since, as observed in previous works (13, 20, 21), large variations of physical properties can be foreseen as a function of composition and then of mean oxidation state of the transition cation. A clear understanding of the relative behavior of this phase would have importance in catalysis and electrochemical applications. 2. EXPERIMENTAL 2.1. Materials and Sample Preparation A set of samples with lithium cationic fraction x" Li/(Li#Mn)"0.333 has been synthesized via a sol}gel process, following the procedure proposed by Barboux et al. (1). The xerogel precursor was pretreated at 523 K; then it 509 0022-4596/99 $30.00 Copyright ( 1999 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. FIG 1.

In the inset some pro"le details are shown. was divided into "ve fractions which were heated for 8 h at di!erent temperatures, 573, 673, 873, 973, and 1073 K respectively. These sol}gel samples will be referred as SG573, SG673, SG873, SG973, and SG1073. Samples were also prepared by solid state reaction from the reactive system Alfa (99.9%) MnO/Carlo Erba (R.P.) Li2CO3, with x"0.333 as previously described (11). In the following, the sample obtained at 1073 K will be referred to as SS1073. An Li-rich sample was obtained by adding an appropriate quantity of Li2CO3 to SS1073 to reach x"0.37. The mixture was annealed at 723 K: this sample will be named SS1073R. Samples for conductivity measurements were prepared by pressing powder with an uniaxial Weber PW40 press into the form of bars (2]3]10 mm). They were then sintered for 12 h in air at the same temperature, 1A, used for the annealing process and slowly cooled (5 K/min) to room temperature (RT). The four electrical contacts were obtained by using a conductive silver paint. 2.2. Apparatus and Procedures The instrumentation for X-ray di!ractometry (XRD), conductivity, static magnetic susceptibility, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements has been previously described (12, 21). EPR (in the X band at 9.31 GHz) and static magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in the temperature ranges 4}500 K and 4}300 K, respectively. Structural and microstructural analysis of XRD patterns (CuKa radiation, Ka1"1.54056 As and Ka2"1.5443 As ) was carried out following the Rietveld method, according to the procedure already reported (11, 21). Re"nement of cationic occupancy factors was not performed because of the strong in#uence of microstructural parameters on the broadening and position of the peaks with decreasing 1A. 3. RESULTS 3.1. XRD XRD patterns of samples obtained from the sol}gel route display the expected lines of LiMn2O4 phase, as shown in Fig. 1. The abundance of spinel-type phase is increased by increasing 1A, while the content of manganese oxides (Mn2O3 and Mn5O8), present as impurities, decreases. At the same time, the spinel peaks narrow and shift toward lower angles with increasing 1A (inset of Fig. 1). After the annealing at 1073 K, only the peaks pertinent to the spinel phase are present. One, two, or three phases were included in the structural model for the Rietveld pro"le re"nement, 510 MASSAROTTI ET AL.

Phase percentages, discrepancy factors (R1, R81, RB, and goodness of "t S as de"ned in (22)), and spinel lattice parameters are reported in Table 1. The total amount of impurity phases evaluated with the Rietveld method rapidly decreases with increasing 1A (Fig. 2a). The spinel cubic lattice parameter a vs 1A is reported in Fig. 2b: a reaches the same value for the SS1073 and for other solid state samples prepared at 1A'1073 K (11). It can be observed that the a values for samples sintered at 1A(1073 K are lower than that reported for the stoichiometric spinel (a"8.247 As (23, 11)). The same e!ect is also observed for the a value pertinent to the SS1073 R sample. This fact can be related to the lithium enrichment of the spinel phase (11). The Li excess y in the formula Li1`yMn2~yO4 was deduced on the basis of the overall cationic fraction x and of the phase abundance for each sample (see Table 1). The SS1073R sample was taken as an Li-rich reference sample (y"0.11) without impurity phases (Table 1). The rapid decrease of full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks with increasing 1A (see Fig. 1 and inset) indicates the increase in the growing rate of the crystallites during the annealing process. To obtain reliable microstructural parameters we used the LS1 program (24): it is based on the Rietveld method and uses Fourier analysis to take into account the peak broadening due to small crystallite size and microstrain, when the instrumental dependence of FWHM on 2h is known. LS1 performs re"nement of structural and microstructural disorder parameters using crystallite size and root mean square microstrain as "tting parameters. For the cubic spinel the constraints for crystallite size components M11"M22"M33 and M12"M13"M23 and for microstrain components e11"e22"e33 and e12"e13"e23 were used according to symmetry considerations (25). In Fig. 3 the trend of microstructural parameters obtained from sol}gel samples is compared with that of samples prepared from solid state reaction at 1A51073 K (25). Larger Mii and Mij values are obtained from solid state SOL}GEL LiMn2O4 PHASE 511 FIG. 3. Trends of (a) Mij (squares) and Mii (circles) and (b) eij (squares) and eii (circles) as a function of 1A.

In the inset the behavior of 1/s. of SS1073 and SG1073 is reported approximately in the same range of temperature. synthesis at the same 1A (1073 K), and a faster growing rate of crystallites achieved by increasing 1A can be inferred (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b shows the rapid decrease of eii values with increasing 1A, reaching at 1A"1073 K approximately the same value observed in samples obtained from solid state reaction. No di!erence can be observed by comparing eij values. Size and strain e!ects become quite evident in the FWHM values of the di!erent hkl plane families and may be evaluated for di!erent directions of the crystallites according to Lutterotti and Scardi (24). On this basis we can estimate the mean crystallite size and microstrain vs 1A for di!erent crystallographic families of planes. The slowest increase of crystallite size with the temperature is observed in the h00 direction, where the thermal-induced decrease of microstrain is more evident. 3.2. Conductivity The results of the conductivity measurements are summarized in Fig. 4. The SG1073 sample, showing a transition temperature around 275 K related to the Jahn}Teller distortion of (Mn3`O6) octahedra (21, 26, 27), approaches the behavior of the SS1073 sample (lines f and a, respectively, in Fig. 4) (21) and, consequently, can be considered stoichiometric. Activation energy of 0.40 eV at 1'290 K is deduced for SG1073, as observed in SS1073 (21). Di!erent behavior is given by sol}gel samples annealed at 1A(1073 K; they show no transition, at least at 15250 K, but only a small variation of the slope. Higher conductivity values observed at 15290 K in samples treated at higher 1A (Fig. 4) are consistent with the lower content of insulating spurious phases. 3.3. EPR At room temperature, the analyzed sol}gel samples show a broad EPR signal with g-factor g42 and with linewidth *B:0.215 T for SG573 and *B:0.330 T for the samples prepared at higher 1A. The solid state samples show similar 512 MASSAROTTI ET AL. FIG. 5. (a) *B and (b) RF as a function of 1 for the EPR signal of SG573 (L), SG673, (.), SG873 (K), SG973 (m), SG1073, (r), SS1073, (d), and SS1073R (j) samples. The lines are included to guide to the eye. The error in *B is about $0.012T for *B:0.2 T and about $0.025 T for *B:0.38T. The mean error in RF is $0.005 T. FIG. 6. The s. and 1/s. curves vs 1 of the SG573 (circles) and SS1073R (squares) samples. EPR signals at g42 with *B:0.330 T for SS1073 and *B:0.250 T for SS1073R. Figures 5a and 5b show *B and resonant "eld (RF) values, respectively, at di!erent 1. A progressive increase of *B with decreasing 1 is typical of sol}gel samples prepared with 1A'800 K and of the SS1073 sample. An analogous trend may be observed in SG673, but with smaller *B values. For SG573, *B is nearly independent of temperature, similarly to what was observed in SS1073R, and abruptly increases in the lower temperature range. The EPR lineshape of SG573 and SS1073R is nearly Lorentzian, while the other samples show an increasing Gaussian character with increasing 1A. 3.4. Static Magnetic Susceptibility The magnetic behavior of SG1073 is consistent with that of the stoichiometric spinel phase observed in samples produced from solid state reaction like the SS1073, reported and discussed in (20). A slight slope variation is observed in the temperature region of the conductivity anomaly near RT, related to the Jahn}Teller transition (see inset in Fig. 4). Slightly di!erent features are observed in sol}gel samples prepared at lower 1A. In Fig. 6 mass susceptibility (s.) and 1/s. data of the SG573 sample in the range 4}300 K are shown and compared with the data of the SS1073R sample. At high temperature the 1/s. vs 1 behavior is nearly linear, with negative intercepts, following the Curie}Weiss law 1 s. "1!h C. , [1] where C. is the Curie constant and h is the Weiss constant. 4. DISCUSSION A strong dependence of a on the annealing temperature has been shown in Fig. 2b. The unusually low a value in samples annealed at temperature as low as 573 and 673 K may be related to the presence of Li-rich spinel phase, according to the variation of the cell parameter as a function SOL}GEL LiMn2O4 PHASE 513 2The magnetic susceptibility data by Schutte et al. (30) and our results are in good agreement. 1 s:120 mol cm3 at 1"300 K, and 0"(!338$60) K (Schutte et al. (30)) 1 s:22,000 g cm3:120 mol cm3 at 1"300 K, and 0"!320 K (our data (13, 20)) For LiMn2O4, in the spin only (g"2) approximation, s.0-"NA 2 k2B g2 3kB(1!0) [S1(S1#1)#S2(S2#1)], where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to Mn4` and Mn3` ions, respectively, so that m2 of a formula unit results in k2Bg2[S1(S1#1)#S2(S2#1)]:40 k2B. [a] As for Mn4` (d3, S1"3/2), k2Bg2S1(S1#1)"15 k2B, [b] from [a] and [b] the spin value of the Mn3` ions results in S2:2.05; i.e. a high-spin con"guration for Mn3` can be deduced. The e!ective number of kB per unit formula is J40"6.32 according to Schutte et al. (30), but this value does not mean that 6.3 unpaired electrons are present in a unit formula and that, consequently, some Mn3` ions in the sample are in the low-spin con"guration. of the stoichiometry deviation y in Li1`yMn2~yO4 (12). The presence of lithium excess in the spinel phase also agrees with the observation of nonlithiated manganese oxides in the samples annealed at low temperature (Fig. 2a). The calculated values of y, reported in Table 1, may support a two-step mechanism for the formation of stoichiometric spinel in sol}gel samples: (I) Formation of Li-rich spinel and manganese oxides (with various manganese oxidation states); (II) Solid state reaction among these intermediate components to give the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 with increasing 1A. The "rst evidence which agrees with this model is the lack in samples prepared at 1A(1073 K of the abrupt variation of conductivity near RT attributed to the cooperative Jahn}Teller e!ect. As already shown, the Jahn}Teller structural transition is only observed in stoichiometric or quasistoichiometric samples with small Li-de"ciency (8, 26). So, conductivity measurements evidence very small stoichiometry deviations from the stoichiometric composition (compare SG973 (y"0.02) and SG1073 (y"0.0) samples in Fig. 4) that EPR measurements cannot directly reveal. Nevertheless, EPR measurements are useful to characterize the progressive Li-enrichment in the samples obtained from synthesis at lower temperature. In fact, smaller *B values (Fig. 5a) are expected from sol}gel samples with larger Li-enrichment, similar to what was observed for the samples SS1073R and SS1073 prepared by solid state reaction. Besides, exchange narrowing, resulting from coupling of identical ions (28), is suggested by the narrower EPR signal and the nearly Lorentzian lineshape of the SS1073R and SG573 samples. This is consistent with the larger amount of Mn4` ions responsible for the EPR signal of the spinel phase (12), resulting from Li-enrichment. Further con"rmation of the Li-enrichment of the spinel phase of SG573 may be derived by susceptibility measurements. The SG573 sample shows an experimental e!ective magnetic moment m%91"4.37 kB. This value, inserted in the relation m241*/%-"m2%91!sm2M/5O8 1!s , [2] where s is the Mn5O8 fraction and mM/5O8"4.80 kB (from the compositional model Mn2` 2 Mn4` 3 O8 (29)), gives rise to m41*/%-"4.32 kB. This value (pertaining to the only spinel phase) agrees with the m41*/%value calculated by the relation (13) m241*/%-" 1 2!y [(1!3y)m2M/3`#(1#2y)m2M/4`], [3] for y"0.07, as obtained by XRD (Table 1). In [3] we assumed m2M/3`"24 k2B, based on the hypothesis of high-spin (S"2) Mn3` con"guration (21). This is also in agreement with a recent study (7), di!erent from that of Schutte et al. (30),2 calling for the coexistence of highand low-spin Mn3` con"gurations. For the pure Li-rich SS1073R, the estimated enrichment matches well the value y"0.11, as obtained from XRD data. The particle size of the Li-rich phase should be rather small in the SG573 sample*about 20 nm from the Mii and Mij values (Fig. 3a)*and progressively larger with increasing 1A, as expected. The formation of stoichiometric and pure LiMn2O4 by the sol}gel method, completed at about 1073 K, is consistent with the small initial crystallite size of the early-enriched phase ("rst step of formation). At 1A(1073 K, the formation of spurious phases (manganese oxides) is consistent with the Li-enriched spinel phase (Table 1). These spurious phases can be related to the variations of RF vs 1 (Fig. 5b) in the EPR measurements. We already veri"ed the shift of RF toward higher magnetic "elds in samples containing even very small amounts of Mn3O4 (20). For SG573 the opposite trend at low temperature could be related to the large presence of Mn5O8. The comparison between the s. curves of SG573 and SS1073R can give indication of the possible magnetic behavior of 514 MASSAROTTI ET AL. FIG. 7. Magnetic behavior of the Mn5O8 phase as deduced by subtraction between SG573 and SS1073R s. curves. The inset shows extrapolated mass magnetization curves vs temperature of SG573 (circles) and SS1073R (squares) samples. the Mn5O8 phase. The di!erence between the s. data of SS1073R and SG573 samples, taking into account the phase percentage in SG573, suggests a ferrimagnetic-like behavior of Mn5O8 at 1(30 K (see Fig. 7), consistent with the RF shift of the EPR signal at low temperatures (see Fig. 5b). 5. CONCLUSIONS XRD and conductivity results demonstrated that the sol}gel synthesis is suitable to obtain pure stoichiometric sample at 1073 K: this evidence is possibly related to the small initial crystallite size with respect to the solid state reaction. On the basis of this observation, a two-step mechanism can be proposed: small crystallite dimensions of Lirich spinel phase and manganese oxides are formed at low temperature and successively react to form stoichiometric LiMn2O4 with increasing 1A. The evolution of the EPR, susceptibility, and conductivity data with changing 1A gives indication of e!ects of impurity phases and lithium enrichment of the spinel phase (Li1`yMn2~yO4).

In this study, we use in situ X-ray diffraction technique to elucidate the thermal degradation mechanism of 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 lithium rich cathode material in the absence and presence of electrolyte to simulate the real life battery conditions and compare its thermal behavior with the commercial LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode material. We show that the thermal induced phase transformations in delithiated lithium rich cathode material are much more intense compared to similar single phase layered cathode material in the presence of electrolyte. The structural changes in both cathode materials with the temperature rise follow different trends in the absence and presence of electrolyte between 25 and 600 C. Phase transitions are comparatively simple in the absence of electrolyte, the fully charged lithium rich cathode material demonstrates better thermal stability by maintaining its phase till 379 C, and afterwards spinel structure is formed. In the presence of electrolyte, however, the spinel structure appears at 207 C, subsequently it transforms to rock salt type cubic phase at 425 C with additional metallic, metal fluoride, and metal carbonate phases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal of Power Sources 285 (2015) 156e160 and LiMO2 (where M 1⁄4 Mn, Co, Ni), also known as the lithium rich cathode material, has received pronounced attention and has been considered as promising cathode material due to its high discharge capacity of ~250 mAh g1 [1]. However, there are several intrinsic problems associated with this material family that need to be solved; e.g., the voltage as well as the capacity decay during cycling, the high irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle, poor rate capability, and oxygen release during cycling, in order to adopt these materials in practical cells [2e4]. Thermal stability is another challenge which could greatly impact the safety of lithium-ion batteries, however it has received little attention unlike the widely studied electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of this material. In this study, we synthesized 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 (LMC) and applied the in situ XRD to monitor the in depth thermal behavior of this cathode material in the presence and absence of electrolyte as a function of temperature. XRD is a powerful technique to study the crystal structure and can provide the roadmap on average bulk structural changes during thermal decomposition, which is crucial to understand the thermal behavior of electrode materials [5e7]. Utilization of this technique during heating the electrode materials in the presence of electrolyte can simulate the real life battery conditions and provides meaningful information about the thermal decomposition of the electrode materials. In our previous studies, we have successfully employed this technique to study the thermal degradation mechanism of nickel-based cathode materials [8e12]. Monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase in a lithium rich cathode material acts as additional lithium sources and provides the anomalous high capacity when lithium rich cathode material is cycled above 4.4 V. In order to evaluate the impact of Li2MnO3 on the thermal stability of this cathode material, thermal induced phase transitions of this selected lithium rich cathode material were comparatively studied with the commercial LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode material, also known as NCM. Outcomes of this study furnish the fundamental understanding of phase transitions in lithium rich cathode material under the thermal abuse and provide guidelines for further research and development in this material for commercial applications. 2. Experimental 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 powder was synthesized by a solegel method [13]. 0.05 mol of lithium acetate Li(CH3COO).2H2O and stoichiometric amounts of nickel acetate Ni(CH3COO)2.4H2O, cobalt nitrate Co(NO3)2.6H2O, and manganese acetate Mn(CH3COO)2.4H2O were dissolved in 190 ml distilled water. The mixed metal solution was added drop-wise to aqueous solution of 10 ml (60%) nitric acid HNO3, 15 ml of citric acid C6H8O7, and 15 ml of ethylene glycol C2H6O2 with constant stirring. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 7.5 using ammonium hydroxide before solvent evaporation to get a transparent viscous gel. This gel was calcined at 950 C for 5 h in air to obtain the desired cathode material. High resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (HRPD) measurements of the synthesized 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 powder were carried out at 9B HRPD beam line at Pohang Light Source-II in South Korea. The pristine powder sample was scanned from 10 to 130.5 with step size of 0.01. The incident X-rays were vertically collimated using a mirror and monochromatized to wavelength of 1.5475 Å using a double-crystal Si (111) monochromator. The detector arm of diffractometer consisted of soller slits with an angular resolution of 2, a flat Ge (111) crystal analyzer, an antiscatter baffle, and a scintillation detector. The electrodes were prepared by mixing 8 wt% PVDF (Kureha) and 8 wt% carbon black (Chevron) in synthesized cathode material to prepare the slurry. The electrode films were formed on Al foil current collector by slurry coating technique. 2032-type coin cells were assembled in the dry room by using Celgard separator, lithium foil as counter electrode, and 1.3 M LiPF6 electrolyte dissolved in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (3:7 by volume) solvent. The cells were fully charged at low current rate of 0.05C to cut-off voltage of 4.7 V using constant current and constant voltage mode, and the net charge capacity of 311 mAh g1 was achieved. The electrode material was scratched from the current collector and loaded into quartz capillaries whereas for the electrolyte-free samples, charged electrodes were washed with excess dimethyl carbonate in the glove box. For the electrolyte containing, a drop excess electrolyte was added in the capillaries after the samples were washed and loaded. The capillaries were sealed in glove box before mounting on the thermal stage of the diffract-photometer of beamline X7B at National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wavelength used at X7B was 0.3196 Å. The spectra were recorded as a set of circles on Mar 345-image plate detector in transmission mode for ~1 min of exposure time while temperature was raised at the rate of 2.5 C min1. In order to make an easy comparison with the results in the literature, all the 2q angles in this paper have been converted to the values corresponding to the CuKa radiation (l 1⁄4 1.54056 Å). Rietveld refinement of recorded HRPD pattern and Pawley fitting of in situ XRD patterns were performed by using GSAS-II package [14]. 3. Results and discussion High resolution powder diffraction pattern and Rietveld refined fit of the synthesized 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 powder are shown in Fig.1, and detailed structural parameters are tabulated in Table 1. Most of the peaks in the pattern were indexed based on a hexagonal a-NaFeO2 type structure with R-3m space group. The weak peaks between 20 and 30 are originated from monoclinic Li2MnO3-like C2/m super lattice, caused by local ordering of Li and Mn in the transition metal layers [15]. Clear splitting of the (006)/ (102) and (108)/(110) reflection pairs indicates a well-defined hexagonal structure [16]. Excellent agreement between observed and calculated pattern in Rietveld fit shows that the desired lithium rich composition was successfully synthesized. In situ XRD patterns of the fully charged 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5 LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 and LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode materials during heating from 25 to 600 C in the absence of electrolyte are shown in Fig. 2. XRD patterns for charged LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 were obtained by Fig. 1. The Rietveld refined fit of 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiMn0.33Co0.33Ni0.33O2 pristine powder HRPD spectrum. S. Muhammad et al. / Journal of Power Sources 285 (2015) 156e160 157 replotting our previously published data for comparison purpose [9]. At 25 C, XRD patterns of both the cathode materials can be indexed as hexagonal structure with R-3m space group. A closer look at Fig. 2 reveals that the intensity ratio of (003)/(104) reflections in rhombohedral structures start to decrease by increasing the temperature. The integrated intensity ratio of (003)/(104) depends on degree of displacement between the transition metals and lithium ions at 3a and 3b sites respectively in R-3m space group. Therefore, the decrease in (003)/(104) intensity ratio indicates increase in cation disorder by increasing the temperature [17]. The distorted oxygen sub lattice in hexagonal a-NaFeO2 structure gives rise to clear splitting of (108) and (110) reflections. These two reflections merge together when there is no distortion in the c direction, and structure is totally cubic [18]. By increasing temperature (108) and (110), reflections merge into (440) reflection, indicating the conversion of hexagonal to cubic spinel phase at ~379 C for 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 and ~350 C for LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2. The lithium rich cathode material exhibits better thermal stability than the NCM in the absence of electrolyte. This behavior can be attributed to the strong octahedral site preference of manganese. Both hexagonal and spinel structures are based on the cubic close packed frame work of oxygen atoms. In hexagonal R-3m type structure, lithium and transition metal ions occupy alternating octahedral sites, whereas in cubic spinel Fd-3m type structure, the lithium ions take the 8a tetrahedral, and the transition metal occupy the 16d octahedral sites. In order for hexagonal structure to transform into cubic spinel type structure, the transition metal must hop through the neighboring tetrahedral site to reach next octahedral site and theoretical calculations show that activation barrier for Mn4þ octahedron-tetrahedron hop is significantly higher than that of cobalt [19]. The lithium rich cathode material has additional Mn4þ content because of its Li2MnO3 phase compared to bare LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2, which will impede its hexagonal to cubic spinel phase transition. Upon further heating, the formed spinel structure undergoes another phase transition, as indicated by the appearance and the gradual increase of the (220) and (422) reflections intensities. These reflections are due to the increased partial occupancy of transition metal at the tetrahedral 8a site, and the appearance of these new reflections means that upon further heating both the cathode materials transform to M3O4-type Fd-3m spinel structure [20]. In situ XRD patterns of charged 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 and LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode materials during heating from 25 to 600 C in the presence of electrolyte are shown in Fig. 3. At 25 C, the XRD patterns of both electrodes can be indexed as hexagonal structure with R-3m space group. By increasing temperature, the hexagonal phase converts to the cubic spinel phase at ~207 C for 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5 LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 and ~304 C for LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2. These temperatures are significantly lower than the onset temperatures of similar phase transitions in the absence of electrolyte. Upon further heating, series of drastic phase transitions take place, and the charged cathode material transforms to the rock salt type cubic structure with Fm3m space group at ~422 C for 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 and ~441 C for LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 with a secondary metallic phase, and the quantity of metallic phase increases by further increasing the temperature up to 600 C. Hexagonal R-3m to cubic Fd-3m structure conversion involves movement of transition metals from a near perfect layered arrangement of lithium and Table 1 The Rietveld refined structural parameters of pristine 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode powder.

S. Muhammad et al. / Journal of Power Sources 285 (2015) 156e160 158 transition metal to the 1/4th occupancy of transition metal in the lithium layer [21]. Increasing the temperature in the presence of electrolyte enhances the movement of transition metals, and the structure becomes rock salt when transition metal ions are randomly distributed in each octahedral layer [5]. Interestingly the prominent reflections for M3O4-type spinel phase were not observed in the presence of electrolyte, likely due to faster kinetics of thermal degradation reaction in the presence of electrolyte. In the case of the lithium rich cathode material, a few additional phases can be observed at high temperature. To index these additional unknown phases and further analyze the thermally induced phase evolution in 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 in the presence of electrolyte, Pawley fitting of diffraction patterns at selected temperatures of ~422 and ~600 C was performed as shown in Fig. 4 [22]. Pawley fitting is a natural choice for the fitting of these in situ diffraction patterns over Rietveld method since perfect crystalline phases cannot be expected during heating of sample. Fitting of diffraction pattern recorded at 422 C shows the presence of metal carbonate R-3c type hexagonal phase (JCPDS 441472) along with the main rock salt MO-type phase. At least two more phases' namely cubic pure metallic and rutile type metal fluoride (JCPDS 1-601) can be distinguished at terminal temperature along with the MO-type rock salt phase. These new phases are formed by the combination of decomposed electrolyte products with cathode material at higher temperature. Electrolyte used in lithium ion batteries contains LiPF6 salt dissolved in ethyl and ethyl methyl carbonate solvents. LiPF6 is known to decompose as: LiPF6 / LiF þ PF5 [23]. PF5 is a strong Lewis acid which can result in ring opening of ethyl carbonate solvent. PF5 can also react with trace water in the electrolyte to form HF which leads to solvent decomposition. Decomposition of electrolyte solvents result in different gaseous species including CO2, C2H4, and C2H5F [24]. These electrolyte decomposition products then attack the electrode material at high temperature to form metal carbonates and metal fluorides phases along with catalyzing the thermal decomposition of electrode material. Lithium rich cathode material is notorious for releasing the oxygen in the first charge and contains defect sites in fully charged state [25]. These defects may act as nucleation sites of new phases in the presence of electrolyte at high temperature [26]. The appearance of these additional new phases in the charged lithium rich cathode material indicates that lithium rich cathode material is much more sensitive to the thermal decomposition reaction with electrolyte as compared to other nickel-based layered cathode materials. Schematic illustration of phase transformations in charged 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 as a function of temperature in the presence and absence of electrolyte is shown in Fig. 5. Lithium rich cathode transforms to spinel phase at higher temperature in the absence of electrolyte, and this phase coexists with M3O4-type spinel till 600 C. In the presence of electrolyte, the hexagonal structure converts to disordered spinel at ~207 C and coexists with negligible quantity of M3O4-type spinel till ~422 C where a metal carbonate phase appears due to active participation Fig. 3.

By heating up to 600 type C, further phase transitions take place, metal carbonate MCO3 phase disappears, and new metal fluoride along with pure metallic phases emerge along with previously formed MO-type phase. 4. Conclusions Lithium rich cathode material 0.5Li2MnO3-0.5LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 was successfully synthesized by the solegel method. Thermal stability and structural changes of this cathode material were studied by using synchrotron-based in situ XRD technique during raising the electrode temperature. In the absence of electrolyte, phase transitions were simple and limited to spinel structure till the termination temperature of 600 C without any secondary phase. However, in the presence of electrolyte, structural changes started at relatively lower onset temperatures, the layered structure transformed to spinel followed by a rock salt and pure metallic structure. Metal carbonate and metal fluoride structures also appeared at ~422 and ~600 C respectively in the lithium rich cathode material due to the reaction of decomposed electrolyte products with cathode material. These results suggest that the presence of electrolyte assists the structural changes at comparatively lower temperatures, and the catalytic activity of electrolyte varies for different electrode materials. The lithium rich cathode material demonstrated better thermal stability in the absence of electrolyte owing to its additional Mn4þ content. However, it exhibited thermal instability towards electrolyte in electrochemically delithiated state due to the presence of defect sites after activation of Li2MnO3 domain. The findings of this study provide crucial information about thermal behavior of the lithium rich cathode material and help design safer high energy lithium ion batteries.

(16), longer reaction times (p96 h) are necessary to obtain a pure lithium manganospinel with high manganese oxidation state. The samples obtained from MnOOH instead of MnCO3 do not contain any Mn2O3 impurity, but rather MnO2 (for two of them), as a result of the oxidation of MnOOH. The sample labeled A4 in Table 1, obtained from Li2CO3 and MnOOH, corresponds to our only successful attempt so far to obtain by solid-state reaction at 4008C a pure lithium manganospinel material Li12dMn222dO4 of composition close to Li2Mn4O9 (d 5 0.11). The lattice parameter a 5 8.204 (3) A ̊ is consistent with the chemical formula Li12dMn222dO4 (d 5 0.047) determined by chemical analysis, which corresponds to an average oxidation state of manganese n1Mn 5 3.69 in the spinel material. These values are intermediate between those reported for LiMn2O4 (d 5 0, a 5 8.248 A ̊ , n1Mn 5 3.50) (24) and Li2Mn4O9 (d 5 0.11, a 5 8.162 A ̊ , n1Mn 5 4.00) (16). These results confirm that the defect spinels Li12dMn222dO4 are difficult to prepare with a precise, predetermined composition, but additionally show that simple X-ray diffraction or oxido-reduction titration can, in fact, provide reliable direct characterization of their exact stoichiometry. (b) Preparation and Characterization of Stoichiometric Spinels Li11dMn22dO4 The B samples of the LiMn2O4–Li4Mn5O12 (d 5 0.33) join are characterized by a progressive substitution of Mn by Li on the (16d) octahedral sites; accordingly, the average FIG. 5.

Figure 6 shows the variation of the manganospinel cubic lattice parameter a with the nominal compositions d in stoichiometric spinel materials Li11dMn22dO4 for three ing materials that we used were not purely stoichiometric series of B samples prepared by the solid-state reaction of and probably contained surface and/or constitutional wa(2 2 d) MnOOH and(1 1 d) LiOH ? H2O at 400, 450, and ter. This resulted in preparing spinel compositions slightly richer in lithium than originally intended, with a Li/Mn ratio equal to 1.04/2 instead of 1/2. The values of the average manganese oxidation state (3.561) and lattice parameter a 5 8.239(1) A ̊ for the A7 sample obtained by reacting MnCO3 and LiOH ? H2O at 9008C can be fully understood on the basis of such initial Li/Mn nonstoichiometric ratio. To provide further evidence of the importance of the choice of the starting materials for obtaining pure highly oxidized lithium manganospinels at low temperature, we regroup in Fig. 5 the X-ray diffraction patterns of the reaction products of three different lithium salts (LiNO3, LiOH ? H2O, and Li2CO3) reacted at 4008C with either MnCO3 or MnOOH, with initial stoichiometry Li/Mn 5 1/2.

At 4008C, for the same stoichiometric starting mixture with Li/Mn 5 4/5, a slightly more oxidized, pure spinel material B10 was obtained with n1Mn 5 3.91 and a 5 8.137 A ̊ , very close to the values reported by Gummow et al. (13) and Richard et al. (10) for Li4Mn5O12. This also supports de Kock et al.’s observation (14) that the stability of Mn41 spinel phases in the system Li2O–y MnO2 increases from y 5 2.5 (Li4Mn5O12) to y 5 4 (Li2Mn4O9) as the concentration of the MnO2 component decreases. Intuitively, it may be easily understood that, at the relatively low temperatures required (T Q 4008C) to keep a high oxidation state for manganese, the formation of a defect spinel Li0.89h0.11[Mn1.78h0.22]O4 FIG. 7.

The left part of Fig. 6 is related to compositions with the Li/Mn ratio close to 1/2, hence close to LiMn2O4. As discussed in detail in the 6508C. We included, for comparative purpose, the values reported by Gummow et al. (13) for samples of nominal previous section, we could not obtain a pure spinel sample by solid-state reaction of 2 MnOOH 1 LiOH ?

Sample B6 is a mixture of MnO2 impurities and a defect spinel of composition Li12dMn222dO4 with a small apparent from Fig. 7 that the value of the average oxidation state in the spinel phase is closely related to the value of lattice parameter (a 5 8.190 A ̊ ), due to a relatively large oxidation state of manganese. the cubic lattice parameter, which varies from a 5 8.248 A ̊ (n1Mn 5 3.5) to a 5 8.137 A ̊ (n1Mn 5 3.91).

The existence of this Jahn–Teller deformation of the spinel material, which is associated with an important anisotropic expansion of the unit cell, is a strong handicap with regard to a good cyclability in cathode materials (11). Recent strategies for developing highly reversible lithium-manganospinel cathode materials at 3 V have therefore aimed at overcoming the Jahn–Teller deformation by preparing Mn41-rich materials such as Li4Mn5O12 and Li2Mn4O9 (12). In a quite recent article (28), Yamada and Tanaka observed, by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction, a reversible phase transition near 280 K for Li[Mn2]O4 that clearly reflects a first-order, cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion of the spinel from cubic to tetragonal symmetry. After cooling at T , 267 K and reheating to room temperature, the X-ray patterns showed FIG. 8.

Figure 8 shows our DSC traces recorded on heating eracy induces a cooperative distortion throughout the crysand cooling over the temperature interval 243–393 K for tal. This phenomenon was clearly identified, for example, sample A3 (n1Mn 5 3.51, y 5 2d 5 0.002) and sample A5 for the tetragonal spinel Mn3O4 (Mn21[Mn31Mn31]O4, (n1Mn 5 3.61, y 5 2d 5 0.06). Sample A3 clearly exhibits c/a 5 1.16) (3, 5, 27). LiMn2O4, which contains a critical a reversible thermal effect around 208C with a thermal concentration of 50% Mn31 (n1Mn 5 3.50), is at the border hysterisis characteristic of a first-order phase change.

The field dependence of the magnetization measured at (a) 83 K and (b) 300 K for three representative samples, LiMn2O4 (A3), Li.95Mn1.9O4 (defect spinel, A4) and Li4Mn5O12 (stoichiometric spinel, B10), is shown in Fig. 10. All these three materials are paramagnetic above 83 K; no spontaneous magnetization is observed at zero field. The temperature dependence of the inverse molar magnetic susceptibility x21 m of the three samples A3, A4, and B10 is depicted in Fig. 11. Above 100–150 K each plot may be represented by a straight line obeying the Curie– Weiss law x21 m 5 (T 2 u)/C. The values of the Weiss constant, obtained by extrapolation to x21 m 5 0, vary from u 5 2 266 K for LiMn2O4 to u 5 1 40 K for Li4Mn5O12. This agrees very satisfactorily with Blasse’s earlier results on the signs of Mn–Mn interactions in lithium manganospinels (30). The experimental value of the effective magnetic moment (eeff) for nearly stoichiometric LiMn2O4 (sample A3) is very close to the theoretical one (eeff 5 4.36 eB) calculated in that case by assuming a mixed valence state consisting of 51% Mn41 (eeff (spin only value) 5 3.873 eB) and of 49% high-spin Mn31 (eeff 5 4.899 eB).

It would appear that in these compositions, which LiMn2O4–Li2Mn4O9–Li4Mn5O12 System Considerable work has been devoted, in the past, to the study of the magnetic properties of spinel materials. Blasse (30) has reported that LiMn2O4 (50% Mn31, 50% Mn41) remains paramagnetic down to 4.2 K with a large, negative Weiss constant (uA 5 2 260 K). The lack of a long-range magnetic order in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic Mn–Mn interactions can be understood as the result of frustration. Additionally, he showed that Li0.5Zn0.5 [Mn1.5Li.5]O4 (100% Mn41) is ferromagnetic (uA 5 135 K) due to 908 Mn41–O–Mn41 positive interactions which, in this particular case, predominate against antiferromagnetic Mn–Mn interactions. On the other hand, Goodenough et al. reported that delithiation of Li[Mn2]O4 leaves an [Mn2]O4 spinel framework (with 100% Mn41 also) that exhibits u p 270 K (31). It was of particular interest therefore to examine the magnetic behavior of lithium manganospinels of the LiMn2O4–Li2Mn4O9–Li4Mn5O12 system. This system, as discussed in detail in the previous paragraphs, provides several isostructural compositions with a continuous variation of the average oxidation state from FIG. 12.

For both systems, we observe a rather regular increase of the Weiss constant with constant is not temperature-independent, but decreases with increasing temperature: the manganese oxidation state, which reflects a progressive change in the relative strengths of the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic interactions between Mnn1 cations xm 5 C/[T 2 (u 2 cT)] [9] in these lithium manganospinels. At this point, two components of the Mn–Mn interactions need to be distinguished: gives a Ceff 5 C/(1 1 c) and a ueff 5 u/(1 1 c).

Both Mn31 (t3e1) and Mn41 (t3e0), are halflying on the joins LiMn2O4–Li4Mn5O12 (Fig. 13a) and filled t orbital cations. The strength of the Mn–Mn interactions increases sharply with decreasing lattice parameter, so it should be stronger for all Mn41 ions, especially in l-MnO2 where the lattice parameter is particularly small. (ii) The 908 Mn–O–Mn interactions take place via an O 2p orbital that s bonds with an e obital on the Mn atom and f bonds with a t orbital on the neighboring Mn atom. The Mn41 ions have empty e orbitals, so the 908 Mn41–O– Mn41 interaction couples a half-filled t orbital with an empty e orbital, which gives a ferromagnetic interaction according to the Goodenough–Kanamori superexchange rules. The Mn31 ions, on the other hand, have partially filled e orbitals, and the Pauli exclusion principle requires antiferromagnetic 908 Mn–O–Mn coupling for interactions between Mn31 ions and between a Mn31 and a Mn41 ion in the absence of a static Jahn–Teller deformation. From the above considerations, the progressive passage from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic behavior when the average oxidation state of Mn is increased from 3.51 to 41 can be explained as follows. LiMn2O4 shows a strongly FIG. 14. Temperature dependence of the magnetization for negative u value (u 5 2 266 K) due to the addition of (i) Li4Mn5O12 (B10).

The Mn4+ content gradually decreases from 84.80% to 82.62% and then increases from 82.62% to 88.98%, when the Li content increases from 1.00 to 1.06. The rate capability of the LiMn2O4 samples evidently increases as the lithium content increases from 1.00 to 1.06. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicate that the Rct values gradually increase from 58.33 Ω to 133.1 Ω and then decrease from 133.1 Ω to 68.79 Ω when the Li concentration increases from 1.00 to 1.06. The Rsf values also increase from 25.67 Ω to 37.84 Ω and then decrease from 37.84 Ω to 16.69 Ω, when the Li concentration increases from 1.00 to 1.06. These changes in Mn4+ content, Rsf, and Rct with the increase in Li content are related to changes in the second phase in LiMn2O4. 1. Introduction Nowadays, an increasing number of researchers are paying attention to lithium-ion batteries, which are an important power source for portable electronic devices [1]. Lithium-ion batteries have many advantages such as a high capacity, which is the main reason for their widespread use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) [2–4]. Many studies report the development of LiMn2O4 as cathode materials that have high specific energy, small self-discharge, and good safety features, in addition to being low cost and environmentally friendly [5]. However, many factors cause capacity fading, such as structural instability induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion and manganese dissolution via the Mn3+ disproportion reaction (2 Mn3+ →Mn4+ + Mn2+) [6–9]. There are many reports in literature about Mn3+, Mn4+ and LixMn2O4: Shin and Manthiram [10] showed that the capacity fading in LMO is due to the development of microstrains and large differences in the lattice parameters between the two cubic phases during charging. Chung and Kim [11] showed that the onset of Jahn-Teller effects in deeply discharged LixMn2O4 electrodes with a Mn3+ rich region on the surface is the primary cause of the fading. Das and Fachini [12] showed that the capacity fading is attributed to the formation of a strong, passive, fluoride layer on the surface of the film, which led to uncertainty regarding the presence of the Jahn-Teller-active Mn3+ in LMO cathodes. Recently, Kang et al. [13] pointed out that Mn4+ in a MnO2 coating layer could not only suppress Mn dissolution effectively, but also provide chemical stability, thereby improving the storage and rate capability of MnO2-coated LiMn2O4. Furthermore, Han et al. [14] confirmed that the Mn4+-rich phase is an appropriate candidate for modifying surfaces to suppress the dissolution of Mn, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of LiMn2O4. Therefore, the presence of Mn4+ on the surface of LiMn2O4 particles can considerably reduce the dissolution of Mn and maintain the stability of LiMn2O4, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. High-rate discharge capability is another important factor to be considered in high-power batteries. Doping of metal cations and anions with small radii, such as F−and S2−, could improve the high-rate discharge capability of spinel LiMn2O4 [15–17]. In our previous study, polyanionic doping (BO3 3−, PO4 3−, and SiO3 2−) of nanosized LixMnO2 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssi.2018.02.032 Received 30 November 2017; Received in revised form 16 February 2018; Accepted 16 February 2018 ⁎ Corresponding authors.

All rights reserved. T was found to be effective in improving the cycle stability and high-rate discharge capability, via a low-temperature redox soft-chemistry route with protection by liquid olefins [18]. Wu et al. found that the spectral features of the cation-doped spinels are sensitive to the dopant content, the structure of the MO6 (M = Li, Mn, Cr) groups, the charge distribution and the average oxidation state of Mn [19]. In this work, we systematically studied LixMn2O4 with different Li concentrations, synthesized under the same experimental conditions and using the same precursors prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The structures, morphology, crystal plane spacing, and Mn valence state of the LixMn2O4 were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Furthermore, the initial discharge curve measurements, cycling tests, rate capability measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to investigate the electrochemical performance of the different LixMn2O4 samples. The results indicated that the changes in Mn4+, Rsf, and Rct with the increase in Li content are related to the changes in the second phase in LiMn2O4. 2. Experimental To synthesize LiMn2O4, a mixture of as-prepared Mn3O4 and Li2CO3 (mole ratios of Li/Mn = 1.0:2, 1.02:2, 1.04:2, 1.06:2) was mixed with alcohol in an agate mortar, calcined at 500 °C for 5 h, and then sintered at 750 °C for 10 h. Finally, a black powder (LiMn2O4) was obtained. Pristine Mn3O4 and Li2CO3 were bought from industrial manufactures. The technological composition for each metal in LixMn2O4 (x = 1.0, 1.02, 1.04, 1.06) is the same as the stoichiometry determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. The structure of the resulting LiMn2O4 was characterized by powder XRD (D/Max2500PC, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation, a graphite monochromator, a tube voltage of 30 kV, a tube current of 100 mA, and a step size of 0.02° from 10° to 120°. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova Nano SEM450, USA). XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 XI with a monochromatic Al Kα (1350.08 eV) anode (250 W, 10 kV, 30 mA). TEM measurements were performed using a JEM-2100F (200 V). The assynthesized LiMn2O4, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride were mixed with a weight ratio of 85:10:5 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to form a slurry. The slurry was coated onto an aluminum foil and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h. The electrolyte was a 1 M LiPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and ethyl methyl carbonate in a 1:1:1 volume ratio. A Cellgard 2400 membrane was used as the electrode separator. Then, the synthesized cathode materials were made into CR2016 coin cells with a metallic lithium plate as the counter electrode. Charge/discharge tests were performed over a voltage range of 3.0–4.3 V with a battery test system (LAND-CT2001A, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using an impedance analyzer (Zahner Elektrik IM6, Germany) over a frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV. 3. Results Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the LixMn2O4 (x = 1.0, 1.02, 1.04, 1.06) samples. Fig. 2 shows an XRD pattern, with its refinement, for the sample prepared with a Li concentration of 1.0. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 match well with the standard state of spinel LiMn2O4. Table 1 shows that the lithium ions occupy the tetrahedral (8a) sites and the manganese ions reside in the octahedral (16d) sites [20]. The strong and sharp reflection peaks in Fig. 1 suggest that the as-prepared LiMn2O4 was well crystallized. In our samples, the intensity ratio of the (311)/(400) peaks first decreased, and then increased with increasing lithium content. The intensity ratio of the (311)/(400) peaks is in the range 93.6%–99.9%. Furthermore, Wang et al. [21] confirmed that the intensity ratio of the (311)/(400) peaks relates to good cyclability. These parameters can be used to forecast the battery performance of LiMn2O4 spinel materials. Therefore, the electrochemical performance for our samples can be predicted to first decrease and then increase with increasing Li content. Fig. 3 shows the morphologies and microstructures of LiMn2O4 samples. It can be seen that LiMn2O4 powders have a typical cubic spinel structure and the estimated primary particle size is about 0.1–0.7 μm in diameter, in the range of submicrocrystal. No significant changes were observed between the four samples shown in Fig. 3, indicating that a small amount of excessive doping of lithium source has no effect on the morphology of LiMn2O4 materials produced using the solid-state method. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Mn 2p3/2 core-levels of LixMn2O4 samples that result from the spin-orbit splitting. The Mn 2p3/2 XPS binding energy for Mn3+ and Mn4+ is located at 641.7 eV (Mn2O3) and 642.6 eV (MnO2), respectively.

The data showed that there were both Mn3+ and Mn4+ in the samples. Additionally, the Mn4+ content gradually decreased from 84.80% to 82.62% and then increased to 88.98% from 82.62%, as shown in Fig. 5. As a consequence, the average valency of Mn decreased from 3.8480 to 3.8262, and then increased to 3.8898 from 3.8262 with increasing lithium content. Fig. 6 shows the charge-discharge curves for 3.0–4.3 V at a rate of 0.5C. The following cyclic tests and rate capability tests were demonstrated using the same coin cell. There are two voltage plateaus: one near 4.0 V and the other near 4.1 V, which indicates that Li+ deintercalation from the oxide occurred step-by-step (as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2)) [22,23]. ↔ + + < − + − LiMn O Li Mn O xLi xe (x 0.5) 2 4 1 x 2 4 (1) ↔ + − + − ≥ − + − Li Mn O Mn O (1 x)Li (1 x)e (x 0.5) 1 x 2 4 2 4 (2) The LiMn2O4 prepared at the Li concentration 1.06 presents the highest discharge capacity (135.3 mAh/g), which results from its higher crystallized microstructure. Similar discharge capacities of 126 mAh/g and 126.7 mAh/g were observed for Li concentrations of 1.02 and 1.04, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the rate capability of LiMn2O4 samples at 25 °C. The rate capability was investigated at different C-rates (current densities). For each 5-cycle average, the charge and discharge process was performed at the same C-rate: between 4.3 V and 3.0 V at room temperature. As the current densities increased from 0.1C to 2C, a large decrease in the discharge capacity was observed for the LiMn2O4 sample, which results from the increased polarization of the batteries due to limited Li+ ion diffusion during cycling. Between 4.3 V and 3.0 V, Li1.06Mn2O4 had a discharge capacity of 130.6, 127, 135.3, 115.6, and 94 mAh/g at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. These results indicate that the Li1.06Mn2O4 sample has the best rate capability. To further study the electrochemical behavior of the LiMn2O4 products, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on the samples after 5 cycles at a rate of 0.1 C at a fully discharged state (see Fig. 8). It is clear that each spectrum consists of one obvious depressed semicircle in the high-to-medium frequency and another straight line in the low frequency. The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 8 was used to fit the EIS data. In this circuit, Re is the electrolyte resistance and electrode resistance. Rsf is the resistance of Li+ ions through the SEI film. The semicircle is associated with the resistance resulting from lithium ion diffusion in the surface layer, representing the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and the slope in the low-frequency region is related to lithium ion diffusion in the bulk material. The plot of the real part of the impedance, Z′ vs. ω-0.5, at the low frequency region for the synthesized LixMn2O4 samples of various Li concentrations (x = 1.0, 1.02, 1.04, 1.06) is displayed in Fig. 9. Re, Rsf, Rct, and DLi + values simulated by ZSimpWin software for LiMn2O4 samples are listed in Table 3. The Li-ion diffusion coefficient (DLi +) in the cathode is estimated according to Eq.

(4): ′ = + + − Z R R σ ω e ct 1/2 (4) where ω is the angular frequency. The Warburg coefficient (σ) is the slope of Z′ vs. ω−1/2 after linear fitting. Li-ion diffusion coefficient (DLi +) is estimated from Eqs. (3) and (4) [24]. The highest Re, Rsf, and Rct values were observed at 5.912 Ω, 37.84 Ω, and 133.1 Ω, respectively, when the Li concentration is 1.02. As shown in Table 3, the DLi + gradually decreased from 5.94 × 10−16 cm2 s−1 to 5.56 × 10−16 cm2 s−1, and then increased from 5.56 × 10−16 cm2 s−1 to 1.739 × 10−15 cm2 s−1, when the Li concentration increased from 1.00 to 1.06. The high diffusion coefficient is related to the better electrochemical performance, which is inversely proportional to Rsf and Rct. In addition, Fig. 10 shows that the Rct values gradually increased from 58.33 Ω to 133.1 Ω, and then decreased to 68.79 Ω from 133.1 Ω, when the Li concentration increased from 1.00 to 1.06. The Rsf values also increased from 25.67 Ω to 37.84 Ω and then decreased from 37.84 Ω to 16.69 Ω, when the Li concentration increased from 1.00 to 1.06 (see Fig. 10). 4. Discussion Fig. 11 shows TEM images of the Li1.06Mn2O4 sample. Fig. 11(a) Fig. 3.

Solid State Ionics 320 (2018) 16–23 19 shows the HRTEM image, Fig. 11(b) is the fast-Fourier transform (FFT) pattern in the [011] zone. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the far spot that is further away from (000) and the near spot that is nearer to (000) on the (400) plane indicate the spot splitting of the (400) plane. The spot splitting of the (400) plane leads to a reduction in the intensity of the (400) peak, which increases the intensity ratio of the (311)/(400) peaks, as shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1 shows that the intensity ratio of the (311)/(400) peaks is between 93.6%–99.9%. By calculating the structure factor, the intensity of (311) and (400) peaks are obtained, and we then get the theoretical value of the intensity ratio of the (311)/(400) peaks of about 84% [21]. The difference between the experimental and theoretical values is due to the spot splitting of the (400) plane. Fig. 11(c) is the inverse FFT image and Fig. 11(d) and Fig. 11(e) show the far-spot imaging and the near-spot imaging in the inverse FFT image, which are basically complementary images. Ten layers of crystal faces perpendicular to the (400) direction were measured in Fig. 11(d) and (e) and the results are shown in Fig. 11(f) and (g). The results indicate that the crystal-plane spacing of the far-spot on the (400) plane is 0.196 nm, and the crystal plane spacing of the nearspot on the (400) plane is 0.204 nm, as shown in the inverse FFT image. Different crystal plane spacing in Fig. 11(c) and the spot splitting on the (400) plane in Fig. 11(b) indicate the existence of the second phase. The second phase may be one of the following three structures: Xu et al. [25] pointed out that the dominant part of a given sample is the cubic spinel phase (Fd-3 m) with secondary tetragonal phases (I41/ amd), which have different lattice parameters. Oikawa et al. [26] showed that reflections of the LT phase in its neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns were indexed not on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell (I41/amd) but roughly as an orthorhombic one (space group Fddd), with lattice parameters a = 8.2797(2), b = 8.2444(3) and c = 8.1981(2) Å. In addition, Thackeray et al. [27] have proposed that the cation distributions in the structures were determined by neutron diffraction to be {Li0.85Υ0.15}8a[Mn1.74Li0.26]16dO4 and {Li0.89Υ0.11}8a[Mn1.78Υ0.22]16dO4, which include Li2Mn4O9 and Li2Mn3O7, where 8a and 16d refer to the tetrahedral and octahedral 648 646 644 642 640 638 636 634 632 Mn 3+ Intensity(a.u.)

Therefore, the second phase space group was the Fd-3 m space group. Meanwhile, thermogravimetric experiments showed oxygen excess in our samples, which indicated that the oxygen content in the second phase was high, so we determined that the second phase was dominated by Mn4+. The second phase was {Li0.888Υ0.112}8a[Mn1.776Υ0.224]16dO4, when the Li/Mn ratio was 1.0:2. The {Li0.888Υ0.112}8a[Mn1.776Υ0.224]16dO4 gradually changed to {Li0.864Υ0.136}8a[Mn1.704Li0.288]16dO4, with the gradual increase of lithium content. The {Li0.888Υ0.112}8a[Mn1.776Υ0.224]16dO4 second phase was formed in LiMn2O4, when the Li/Mn ratio was 1.0:2. The {Li0.888Υ0.112}8a[Mn1.776Υ0.224]16dO4 gradually changed to {Li0.864Υ0.136}8a[Mn1.704Li0.288]16dO4, with the gradual increase of lithium content. The total amount of the second phase decreased gradually, which meant the amount of Mn4+ gradually decreased, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to the existence of the second phase, the formation of a surface passivation film between the cathode material and the electrolyte is suppressed, thereby reducing the value of Rct and Rsf [14]. When the lithium content increased from 1 to 1.02, the total amount of the second phase was reduced to the minimum, which made the values of Rsf and Rct gradually increase to the maximum, as shown in Fig. 10. When the lithium content increased from 1.02 to 1.06, the amount of {Li0.864Υ0.136}8a[Mn1.704Li0.288]16dO4 increased gradually, which lead to an increase in Mn4+ and a decrease in Rsf and Rct. The results indicate that the rate capability of the LiMn2O4 samples evidently increases as the lithium content increases from 1.00 to 1.06, as shown in Fig. 7. Although Rct and Rsf are very low when the Li content was 1.0, and the rate performance is poor, which is related to the Jahn-Teller effect [11]. Fig. 7 shows the rate capability of LiMn2O4 samples, where the results verify the prediction of the electrochemical performance in Fig. 1. 5. Conclusions In this study, we systematically studied LixMn2O4 with different Li concentrations, synthesized under the same experimental conditions, using the same precursors prepared by solid-state reaction method. The TEM measurements showed different crystal plane spacing and spot splitting on the (400) plane, which indicated the existence of the second phase. The refinement results showed that the second phase space group has an Fd-3 m structure. Upon increasing of the Li content, the Mn4+ content first decreased and then increased, while the values of Rct and Rsf first increased and then decreased, which are related to the transformation of the second phase in LiMn2O4.

The effective magnetic moment (meff) of Mn ions decreases monotonically with decreasing x, indicating that Mn3þ ions with S1⁄42 (t3 2ge1 g) are oxidized to Mn4þ ions with S1⁄43/2 (t3 2g) with decreasing x. On the other hand, as x decreases from 1 to 0.6, the Curie–Weiss temperature (Yp) increases monotonically from  260 to 100 K, and then levels off to 100 K with further decreasing x. This indicates that the antiferromagnetic interaction is dominant in the whole x range. For the x1⁄40.48 sample, the temperature dependence of w in field-cooling mode clearly deviates from that in zero-field-cooling mode below 63 K (1⁄4Tm). Furthermore, the hysteresis loop is observed in the magnetization vs. field curve at 5 K. Since the zero-field mSR spectrum is well fitted by a strongly damped oscillation function, the Mn moments for the x1⁄40.48 sample are in a highly disordered fashion down to the lowest temperature measured. & 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction The lithium manganese oxide spinel LixMn2O4 with space group Fd3 ̄m, in which Li and Mn ions occupy the tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites, respectively, has been intensively studied as a positive electrode material for lithium-ion batteries [1–3]. This is due to its high operating voltage, inexpensive material cost, and low toxicity compared with LiCoO2, which is currently used in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Besides an application to lithium-ion batteries, LixMn2O4 and related compounds have been of great interest in magnetism. In the LiMn2O4 lattice, the magnetic Mn ions are arranged at the corner of a tetrahedron (see Fig. 1(a)). More specifically, the tetrahedron is likely to consist of two Mn3þ ions with S1⁄42 (t3 2ge1 g) and two Mn4þ ions with S1⁄43/2 (t3 2g), because the average valence of the Mn ions (Vave Mn ) is þ3.5. This indicates the presence of three-dimensional geometrical frustration, if the Mn–Mn interaction is antiferromagnetic (AF). Actually, the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 exhibits an AF transition with TN60 K [4–7], although its AF spin arrangement is not fully determined even by neutron scattering measurements due to the presence of a strong diffuse scattering. In addition, the fully delithiated phase Li0Mn2O4 (l-MnO2), in which the Vave Mn should be þ4, shows AF transition with TN1⁄432 K [8]. There are three different type magnetic interactions between the nearest neighboring Mn ions in LixMn2O4, namely, the interaction between Mn3þ and Mn3þ, Mn3þ and Mn4þ, and Mn4þ and Mn4þ. According to Goodenough–Kanamori rules [9], only a 901 superexchange Mn4þ–O2–Mn4þ coupling is ferromagnetic (FM), whereas all other couplings such as direct Mn3þ–Mn3þ, direct Mn4þ–Mn4þ, and 901 superexchange Mn4þ–O2–Mn3þ, are AF. Therefore, the AF interaction is thought to be dominant when half of the corners of the tetrahedron or all four corners of the tetrahedron are occupied by Mn4þ ions. On the contrary, the spinel compounds having a superlattice structure such as (Li1/2Zn1/2)[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P213) [10] and Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [11] undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition with TC1⁄422 and 20 K, respectively. Here, for both compounds, Liþ (Mg2þ) and Mn4þ ions are ordered by 1:3 ratio at the regular 16d site of the space group Fd3 ̄m [10–12]. Since Liþ and Mg2þ ions are non-magnetic, the three corners of the tetrahedron formed by four cations at the 16d site, are occupied by magnetic Mn4þ ions. The difference between LiMn2O4 (l-MnO2) and Li1/2Zn1/2[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4), on one hand, suggests that the occupancy of the Mn ions at the 16d site (z16d Mn ) plays a significant role for determining the magnetic ground Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jssc Journal of Solid State Chemistry 0022-4596/$ see front matter & 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Journal of Solid State Chemistry 184 (2011) 1096–1104 state of lithium manganese oxide spinels. On the other hand, the cubic lattice parameter (ac), i.e. the distance between the Mn ions (dMn–Mn) would also affect the magnetism on these spinels. This is because our recent magnetic susceptibility (w) measurements on Lix[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) demonstrated that the magnetic ground state alters from FM at x1⁄41 to paramagnetic (PM) or AF at x1⁄40.05 with decreasing dMn–Mn from 2.882 to 2.820 ̊A [13,14]. Here, Ni2þ and Mn4þ ions in Li1⁄2Ni2 þ 1=2Mn4þ 3=2O4 are ordered by 1:3 ratio at the regular 16d site of the space group Fd3 ̄m [15], as in the case for (Li1/2Zn1/2)[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (dMn–Mn1⁄42.887 ̊A) [10] and Li[Mg1/2 Mn3/2]O4 (dMn–Mn1⁄42.888 ̊A) [11]. Moreover, only the Ni2þ/Ni4þ redox couple is responsible for the delithiated reaction, whereas Mn4þ ions remain inactive [16]. Since the Ni4þ ions are in a nonmagnetic low-spin state with t6 2g (S1⁄40) [16,17], the arrangement of Mn4þ ions in Li0[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 is essentially the same to those in (Li1/2Zn1/2)[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 and Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4. Thus, the difference in magnetism between Li0[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 and (Li1/2Zn1/2)[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (or Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4) could be explained by the dependence of magnetic interactions on dMn-Mn, if we ignore the effects on the non-magnetic Liþ and Zn2þ ions at the 8a site [13]. During the delithiation process of LixMn2O4, the amount of Mn4þ ions at the corners of the tetrahedron increasing with decreasing x; two Mn4þ ions for x1⁄41, three Mn4þ ions for x1⁄40.5, and four Mn4þ ions for x1⁄40 (Fig. 1(b)–(d)). Moreover, the value of dMn–Mn for the x1⁄41/2 compound (Li1=21⁄2Mn3þ 1=2Mn4þ 3=2O4) is reported to be 2.88 ̊A [2], and is almost similar to those for (Li1/2Zn1/2)[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P213) [10], Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [11], and Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [13–17]. The magnetic study on delithiated LixMn2O4, hence, provides crucial information on the complex magnetic properties of lithium manganese oxide spinels. However, to our knowledge, the magnetism of LixMn2O4 with 0oxo1 has never been reported, except for the results of ab initio calculations [18]. In this paper, we report the results of w and muon spin rotation/relaxation (mSR) measurements for the chemically delithiated LixMn2O4 samples with 0.07rxr1 and discuss the magnetic phase diagram for LixMn2O4. 2. Experimental section A polycrystalline sample of LiMn2O4 was synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction technique using reagent grade Li2CO3 and MnO2 (Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. Ltd., Japan) powders. The reaction mixture was heated at 900 1C for 12 h in air and then cooled down to room temperature (T) at 5 1C  min1. The obtained LiMn2O4 powder was characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and an electrochemical charge/ discharge test in a non aqueous lithium cell. XRD measurements were performed at a synchrotron radiation facility of SPring-8 (BL19B2) in the T range between 260 and 320 K. The delithiated LixMn2O4 sample was prepared by a chemical reaction as reported previously [1,19]. That is, 3.6 g (0.02 mol) of LiMn2O4 powder was immersed in 100 mL HNO3 solution and stirred for 24 h at room T. The concentration of HNO3 (cM) solution was 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.19, 0.20, 0.225, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.375, 0.40, and 0.50 M, respectively. After the acid treatment, the sample was filtered and dried at 60 1C for 24 h. The Li/Mn ratio, i.e. x in LixMn2O4 was determined by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, CIROS 120, Rigaku Co. Ltd., Japan). As seen in Fig. 2, x decreases almost linearly with increasing cM up to 0.40 M, indicating that the following disproportionation reaction proceeds as expected: 4LixMn2O4þ8Hþ-6l-MnO2þ4xLiþ þ2Mn2þ þ4H2O (1) The crystal structure for the LixMn2O4 samples was examined by powder XRD measurements with iron Ka radiation (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS, Inc.) at room T (25 1C). In order to confirm the existence/absence of oxygen deficiency and Hþ ions in the LixMn2O4 sample, thermogravimetric (TG, TGA-50, Shimadzu Co. Ltd., Japan) and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS, Py-2010D, Frontier Lab Co.

First, the sample was cooled down to 5 K in ZF from 100 K, then a magnetic field was applied, and finally wZFC was measured with increasing T from 5 to 100 K (80 K for the x1⁄41 and 0.85 samples). Subsequently, wFC was measured with decreasing T from 100 (80 for the x1⁄41 and 0.85 samples) to 5 K. We also performed mSR Mn4+ Mn3+ Fig. 1. (a) Schematic illustration of the crystal structure for LixMn2O4 having a spinel-framework structure of space group Fd3 ̄m, in which Li and Mn ions sit the tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites, respectively. The magnetic Mn ions form a tetrahedron, satisfying one of the conditions for geometrical frustration. Since the average valence of the Mn ions (Vave Mn ) is þ3.5 at (b) x1⁄41, the tetrahedron is likely to consist two Mn3þ ions (red circle) and two Mn4þ ions (blue circle). The amount of Mn4þ ions increases with decreasing x; three corners of the tetrahedron or all four corners of the tetrahedron are occupied by Mn4þ ions at (c) x1⁄41/2 or at (d) x1⁄40. Note that Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) and Li1/2Zn1/2[Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P213), in which three corners of the tetrahedron are occupied by Mn4þ ions and the rest of the corner is occupied by non-magnetic ions (Mg2þ or Liþ), exhibit ferromagnetic transition at TC1⁄420 K. When the Mn3þ ions and Mn4þ ions at the 16d site are ordered by 1:1 ratio in the Fddd space group or ordered by 1:3 ratio in the P4332 space group, the Mn3þ (or Mn4þ) ions no longer form a tetrahedron.

The x1⁄40.48 sample was pressed into a disk with 15 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness, then the disk was packed by an aluminized Kapton foil, and finally placed in a muon-veto sample holder. The details of the experimental setup and technique are described in elsewhere [20]. 3. Results 3.1. Structural and thermal analyses Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns for the LixMn2O4 samples with x1⁄41, 0.85, 0.74, 0.48, 0.20, and 0.07. All the LixMn2O4 samples are identified as a spinel-framework structure with space group of Fd3 ̄m, in which the tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites are occupied by lithium and manganese ions, respectively. For the samples with 14x40.07, the XRD peaks are broad compared with those for the x1⁄41 and 0.07 samples. Furthermore, as seen in the enlarged XRD pattern (right side of Fig. 3(a)), an additional XRD peak indicated by arrow is slightly observed in the vicinity of the major XRD peak. This indicates that the sample with 14x40.07 is not a single-phase but a mixture of different cubic phases, although the average Li composition almost agrees with the calculated Li composition based on Eq. (1) (see Fig. 2). Fig. 3(b)–(d) shows the results of a Rietvled analysis by RIETAN2000 [21] for the x1⁄41, 0.48, and 0.07 samples, respectively. The structural parameters such as cubic lattice parameter (ac), oxygen position, and isotropic atomic displacement factor (Biso) are listed in Table 1. The Rietveld analysis for the samples with 14x40.07 are performed under the assumption that the sample is in a mixture of two different cubic phases. As seen in Fig. 4, the ac vs. x curve of the major phase is almost consistent with that for the electrochemically delithiated LixMn2O4 compounds [2], except for the x1⁄40.85 and 0.74 samples. That is, as x decreases from 1 to 0.61, ac monotonically decreases from 8.240(5) to 8.162(5) ̊A, and then rapidly drops to 8.03 ̊A with further decreasing x. Fig. 5 shows the results of (a) TG and (b) Py-GC/MS analyses for the x1⁄40.07 sample. The TG curve exhibits two sudden decreases around 820 and 1130 K. The change in the sample weight at 1000 and 1200 K are 90.7% and 87.9%, respectively, which agree with the calculated values of the following oxygen evolution reactions: MnO2-1/2Mn2O3þ1/4O2 (weight loss from MnO2: 9.2%) (2) Mn2O3-2/3Mn3O4þ1/6O2 (weight loss from MnO2:12.3%) (3) This indicates the absence of oxygen deficiency in the bulk of the sample, although we cannot exclude the possibility of the non-stoichiometric defects on the surface. As seen in Fig. 5(b), there are two peaks centered around 840 and 1130 K in the O2 þ (mass/charge1⁄432) spectrum. The former corresponds to the reaction described in Eq. (2), while the latter the reaction described in Eq. (3). Two broad peaks are also observed in the H2Oþ (mass/charge1⁄418) spectrum. The peaks around 450 and 650 K are attributed to the dehydration reactions of absorbed/ adsorbed water and structurally bonded/intercalated water, respectively. Thus, the Py-GC/MS analysis shows that Hþ ions exist in the crystal lattice of the x1⁄40.07 sample, as for the chemically delithiated LixNiO2, more specifically H0.5Li0.01NiO2 [19,22]. However, the peak ratio of H2Oþ/O2 þ for the x1⁄40.07 sample is significantly small (0.02) compared with that for H0.5Li0.01NiO2 (0.25). If we assume that the peak ratio of H2Oþ/O2 þ corresponds to the amount of Hþ ions, the chemical formula for the x1⁄40.07 sample is represented as H0.08Li0.07 Mn2O4. Thus, the chemically delithiation reaction of LixMn2O4 is almost completed, although that of LixNiO2 induced the insertion of large amount of Hþ ions in the lattice [19,22]. 3.2. Macroscopic magnetism by w Fig. 6 shows the T dependence of (a) w and (b) w1 for the LixMn2O4 samples with x1⁄41, 0.85, 0.74, 0.48, 0.2, and 0.07 measured in FC mode with H1⁄410 kOe.

According o the enlarged XRD patterns in the 2y range between 421 and 521 (right side), a minor phase indicated by arrow is slightly observed for the samples with 14x40.07. The results of Rietveld analyses for the (b) x1⁄41, (c) 0.48, and (d) 0.07 samples are also shown. The observed (Iobs) and calculated (Icalc) intensity data are plotted as points and solid line, respectively, in the upper field. The bar-code-type indications are the Bragg reflections. The difference between Iobs and Icalc is shown in the lower field. K. Mukai et al. / Journal of Solid State Chemistry 184 (2011) 1096–1104 1098 the samples show a Curie–Weiss paramagnetic behavior above 200 K, except for a small cusp at TJT1⁄4290 K for the x1⁄41 sample due to a cooperative Jahn–Teller (JT) transition of Mn3þ ions with S1⁄42 (t3 2ge1 g) [4,23]. Actually, the XRD measurements on the x1⁄41 sample confirmed the structural phase transition around 290 K from the high-T cubic phase (Fd3 ̄m) to low-T orthorhombic phase (Fddd). For the PM state, the Curie–Weiss law in the general form is written as w 1⁄4 Nmeff 2 3kBðTYpÞ þw0 ð4Þ where N is the number density of the Mn ions, meff is the effective magnetic moment of the Mn ions, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature, Yp is the paramagnetic Curie–Weiss temperature. Using Eq. (4) in the T range between 200 and 400 K, we obtain the values of meff and Yp for the LixMn2O4 samples. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the obtained meff decreases monotonically with decreasing x, being consistent with the spin-only predicted value ofmpre eff . Here, mpre eff was calculated by the assumption that Mn3þ ions are in the high-spin state with S1⁄42 (t3 2ge1 g), Mn4þ ions with S1⁄43/2 (t3 2g), and the gyromagnetic ratio g1⁄42. The monotonic decrease in meff with x, hence, indicates that the increase in the amount of Mn4þ ions is proportional to x as expected. This is very different from the case for the chemically delithiated LixNiO2, because meff (1⁄41.43 mB) for the chemically delithiated LixNiO2 is considerably large compared with the prediction for the spinonly value (mpre eff 0 mB) due to the presence of Hþ ions [18,19]. On the other hand, the value of Yp for the x1⁄41 sample is estimated as  260 K, and is almost comparable to the past results of Yp1⁄4 337 [4], 273 [24], and 266 K [25] (see Fig. 5(b)). As x decreases from 1 to 0.6, Yp increases monotonically up to  100 K, Table 1 The structural parameters for the LixMn2O4 samples with x1⁄41, 0.48, and 0.07 determined by the Rietveld analysis.

This means that the AF interaction weakens with decreasing x, particularly in the x range below 0.6. However, the negative Yp value suggests that the AF interaction is dominant even for the xo0.6 samples. As seen in Fig. 6(a), w for the samples with 0.07oxo1 increases rapidly below 100 K, indicating that ferromagnetic (FM) components appear in these samples. Furthermore, the x1⁄40.48 sample exhibits the highest w at 5 K. Here, the amount of Mn4þ ions at the tetrahedron for the x1⁄40.5 compound (1⁄4Li1=21⁄2Mn3þ 1=2Mn4þ 3=2O4) is similar to those for Li1/2Zn1/2 [Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P213) [10], Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [11], and Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [13–17], although one corner of the tetrahedron is occupied by magnetic Mn3þ ions and Liþ ions at the 8a site are partially delithiated. In addition, the dMn–Mn for the x1⁄40.48 sample is calculated to be 2.884 ̊A by the value of ac( ffiffiffi 2 p ac=4), and is almost comparable to those for Li1/2Zn1/2 [Li1/2Mn3/2]O4 (dMn–Mn1⁄42.896) [10], Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (dMn–Mn 1⁄42.898 ̊A) [11], and Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (dMn–Mn1⁄42.886 ̊A) [13–17]. Therefore, the magnetization, w in both ZFC and FC modes, and mSR were measured in order to clarify the magnetic ground state for the x1⁄40.48 sample. Here, mSR is very sensitive to a local magnetic environment and is one of the most powerful tools to detect static magnetic order, such as FM, AF, and ferrimagnetic [19].

That is, as H increases from 0 kOe, M rapidly increases with changing its slope up to 20 kOe, and then increases almost linearly with further increasing H. The magnitude of M does not level off even at H1⁄455 kOe. As seen in Fig. 8(b), a hysteresis loop is clearly observed at Hr10 kOe, indicating the presence of a FM component in the x1⁄40.48 sample. Although a small hysteresis loop is also observed for the x1⁄41 and 0.07 samples, the x dependence of Mr shows a maximum around x1⁄40.5, whereas the value of Hc is almost x-independent; Hc1.5 kOe (see Fig. 8(c)). This means that, as x decreases from 1, the amount of the FM component (the area of hysteresis loop) caused by the x0.5 phase increases up to 0.5, then decreases with further decreasing x. Fig. 9 shows the w(T) curves measured in both ZFC and FC modes for the LixMn2O4 samples with (a) x1⁄41, (b) x1⁄40.85, (c) x1⁄40.74, (d) x1⁄40.61, and (e) x1⁄40.53. Fig. 10 shows those for the LixMn2O4 samples with (a) x1⁄40.48, (b) x1⁄40.41, (c) x1⁄40.20, (d) x1⁄40.15, and (e) x1⁄40.07. The stoichiometric LiMn2O4 is known to exhibit the AF transition with TN1⁄440 K by 7Li-NMR measurements [4] or TN1⁄460 K by neutron scattering measurements [5–7]. However, both wZFC(T) and wFC(T) curves for the x1⁄41 sample are different from that for a typical AF transition [9]; wFC rapidly increases with decreasing T below 55 K, probably due to a canted spin structure in the sample [5]. For the xo1 samples, the wFC(T) curve also deviates from the wZFC(T) curve, suggesting the existence of a FM, ferrimagnetic, or spin-glass-like transition. Note that the transition temperature (Tm) increases with decreasing x down to 0.5, and then decreasing with further decreasing x. Here, Tm is defined as the temperature at which the wFC(T) curve deviates from the wZFC(T) curve. Thus, Tm1⁄4TN1⁄455 K for the x1⁄41 sample, while Tm1⁄463 K for the x1⁄40.48 sample. For the x1⁄40.07 sample, the FM component is still observed in the wFC(T) curve below 40 K, although l-MnO2 is reported to exhibit the AF transition at TN1⁄432 K by neutron scattering measurements [8]. 3.3. Microscopic magnetism by mSR Fig. 11(a) shows the T dependence of the ZF-mSR spectra for the x1⁄40.48 sample in the time below 10 ms. The comparison in the ZF-mSR spectrum at 1.8 K (tr0.1 ms) between the x1⁄40.48 sample and Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [11] is also shown in Fig. 11(b). In the ZF-mSR spectrum for Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332), a first minimum at t0.015 ms and a second minimum at t0.039 ms are clearly observed, suggesting that the static magnetic order exists in the sample. Since the M(H) curve exhibits a typical FM hysteresis at Hr5 kOe, Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) enters into FM phase below TC1⁄420 K [11]. On the contrary, the ZF-mSR spectrum for the x1⁄40.48 sample lacks an oscillatory signal but shows a fast relaxation in the time domain below 0.1 ms.

This indicates that there are at least two muon sites in the x1⁄40.48 lattice, or that the muon spins are depolarized by two different processes. According to the calculated D values on Li0.2[Li0.04Mn1.96]O4 [27] and Li0.09Mn2O4 [28], muons are most likely to sit the vacant Li (8a) site in the x1⁄40.48 sample.

Fig. 12 shows the T dependence of the (a) normalized asymmetries (Ai/A0 with i1⁄41, 2, and 3), (b) oscillation frequency f1 (1⁄4o1/2p), and (c) relaxation rates li associated with the Ai signal. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 A P (t) A P (t) TIME (μs) (+0.1) 1.8 K 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.01 0.1 1 10 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 ZF-μSR Li Mn O (x=0.48) 5 K (+0.1) 15 K (+0.4) 12 K (+0.3) 10 K (+0.2) 20 K (+0.5) 1.8 K Fig. 11.

The top of five ZF-mSR spectra are shifted upward by þ0.1 for clarity of display. Note that the full asymmetry (0.24) is not obtained at To15 K, because the relaxation rate is too fast for mSR.

Fitting results of the weak-transverse-field (wTF-) and zero-field (ZF-) mSR measurements for the LixMn2O4 sample with x1⁄40.48: (a) normalized asymmetries of ATF, A1, A2, and A3, (b) oscillation frequency f1 (1⁄4o1/2p), and (c) relaxation rate li associated with the Ai signal. wTF-mSR measurements were performed in the applied field with HwTF1⁄450 Oe. The value of ATF corresponds to the volume fraction of the paramagnetic phases in the sample. The solid line in (b) is the fitting result by the function f11⁄4f1(0 K) [(TNT)/TN]b. The internal magnetic field (Hint) is, thus, calculated to be 2810 Oe using the muonic gyromagnetic ratio (f1(0 K)/gm1⁄438.1/13.553  103). K. Mukai et al. / Journal of Solid State Chemistry 184 (2011) 1096–1104 1102 As T decreases from 25 K, A1 slightly increases down to 15 K, and then keeps almost constant value (0.74) with further lowering T. On the other hand, both f1 and l1 rapidly increase with decreasing T. Although cosine oscillation function is widely used for fitting the ZF-mSR spectrum in magnetic ordered state, the value of l1 reaches 170 ms1 at 1.8 K. This indicates that the x1⁄40.48 sample is in a highly disordered fashion. Here, the value of A1 is almost close to 2/3. In addition, l2 and l3 are very smaller than l1. Thus, both A2 and A3 signals are most likely to be the ‘‘1/3 tail’’ signal. Note that the normalized weak-transversefield (wTF-) asymmetry ATF, which corresponds to the volume fraction of the PM phases in the sample, reaches 0 below 20 K (see Fig. 12(a)). This indicates that the whole sample enters into a magnetic phase below 20 K. 4. Discussion As seen in Fig. 7(a), the meff(x) curve supports that the Mn3þ ions with S1⁄42 (t3 2ge1 g) are oxidized to the Mn4þ ions with S1⁄43/2 (t3 2g) with decreasing x in LixMn2O4. This means that the amount of Mn4þ ions at the corners of the tetrahedron increases with decreasing x as expected. Furthermore, since the wFC(T) curve deviates from the wZFC(T) curve below Tm (r63 K) for all the samples measured, they are found to undergo a magnetic phase below Tm. The ZF-mSR spectrum for the x1⁄40.48 sample is found to be heavily damped even at 1.8 K. This indicates that the x1⁄40.48 sample is in a magnetic disordered phase even at 1.8 K. Otherwise, even if the static magnetic order exists in the x1⁄40.48 sample, it is unlikely long range but likely short range, although mSR provides no information on the length of magnetic order. In spite of the several neutron scattering measurements on LiMn2O4 [5–7], its ordered moments are still unknown, whereas the ordered moment for Li0Mn2O4 (l-MnO2) is reported to be 2.78(9) mB/Mn4þ, which is very close to the expected saturation moment (3 mB) [8]. If we assume that the ordered moment for the x1⁄40.48 sample is comparable to the value of 3.25 mB [1⁄4(g  SMn3þ  1/2þg  SMn4þ  3/2)  1/2] and that muons are located at the vacant 8a (Li) site, the internal magnetic field (Hint) is estimated to be 795 Oe by a simple dipolar calculation. Note that this estimation is the upper limit of Hint. On the contrary, the observed Hint is calculated to be 2810 Oe using the value of f1(0 K) (1⁄438.1 MHz) and the muonic gyromagnetic ratio (gm/2p1⁄4 13.553 kHz/Oe). As seen in Fig. 11(a), the ZF-mSR spectrum for the x1⁄40.48 sample exhibits a strongly damped oscillation even at 1.8 K. The wide field distribution of Hint would affect the large discrepancy between the calculated and experimental Hint values. The other contribution would come from the distance between the muon site and Mn ions. Fig. 13 shows the schematic magnetic phase diagram for LixMn2O4 determined by w and mSR measurements. Considering the past neutron results on LiMn2O4 [5–7] and Li0Mn2O4 [8], one can argue that there are three distinct phases in the phase diagram of LixMn2O4; namely, the AF ordered phase with TN1⁄460 K for LiMn2O4, a disordered magnetic phase with Tm1⁄463 K for Li0.5Mn2O4, and the other AF ordered phase with TN1⁄432 K for Li0Mn2O4. The samples with 14x4 0.5 are most likely to be a mixture between LiMn2O4 and Li0.5Mn2O4, while those with0.5Zx40 are a mixture between Li0.5Mn2O4 and Li0Mn2O4. This is because there are at least two peaks consisting of the first highest peak (1⁄4Tm1) and second highest peak (1⁄4Tm2) in the dwZFC/dT(T) curve for the samples with 14x40 (Figs. 9 and 10). Tm2 for the samples with 14xZ0.53 almost corresponds to the AF transition (1⁄4Tm1) of the x1⁄41 phase, while Tm2 for the samples with 0.48Zx40 (Tm1 for the x1⁄40.41 and 0.15 samples) is attributed to the AF transition (1⁄4Tm1) of the x1⁄40 phase. As seen in Fig. 3(a), this scenario is consistent with the results of XRD measurements at room T for the samples with 14x40.07. Furthermore, wTF-mSR measurements on the x1⁄40.48 sample also supports that the sample is magnetically inhomogeneous in a microscopic scale, because the T dependence of ATF shows a large transition width (DT60 K) as in the case for Li[Li1/3Mn5/3]O4 [29] (see Fig. 12(a)). However, both meff and Yp, which were estimated from the data above 200 K, change linearly with x in the x range between 1 and 0.6 (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). This implies that the contribution of the minor phase in the sample is negligibly small and that a possible T-induced phase separation occurs at a certain temperature below 200 K for the samples with 14xZ0.6. In order to confirm the above hypothesis, structural analyses especially below 60 K are crucial for LixMn2O4. The spinel compounds such as Li1/2Zn1/2[Li1/2Mn1/2]O4 (P213) [10] and Li[Mg1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [11] show FM order below TC1⁄422 and 20 K, respectively. Furthermore, Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) exhibits ferrimagnetic order below TC1⁄4130 K; i.e. the spin arrangements of both Ni2þ–Ni2þ and Mn4þ–Mn4þ ions are FM, while that of Ni2þ–Mn4þ is AF [12–14]. As seen in Fig. 8(a), the magnitude of M for the x1⁄40.48 sample at 5 K is not saturated even at H1⁄455 kOe (7600 emu mol1). Moreover, ZF-mSR spectrum confirmed that the ground state of the x1⁄40.48 sample is in a disordered magnetism. The existence/absence of the ordering of Mn3þ/Mn4þ ions in Li0.5Mn2O4 is currently unknown at low T due to the lack of structural data below 200 K. However, the spinel compounds which show FM order have superlattice structure even at room T [10–12]. Since the dMn–Mn for the x1⁄40.48 sample is almost comparable to that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (P4332) [12–17], the distribution of Mn4þ ions at the 16d site, in other words superlattice structure is found to strongly correlate with the FM order for the LiM1/2Mn3/2O4 compounds with M1⁄4Mg2þ, Zn2þ, and Ni2þ. Other scenario would come from the Liþ ions at the 8a site, because the x1⁄40.48 sample is partially delithiated. It should be noted that the magnetic phase diagram for LixMn2O4 is very different from that for Li[LiyMn2y]O4. That is, as y increases from 0, not the AF transition but a spin-glass-like 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Disordered AF AF T T T PM T (K) x in Li Mn O Fig. 13. Magnetic phase diagram for LixMn2O4 determined by magnetic susceptibility (w) measurements and muon spin rotation/relaxation (mSR) measurements. The magnetic transition temperatures of Tm, Tm1, and Tm2 are obtained by the temperature dependence of w measured in both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and fieldcooling (FC) modes with H1⁄4100 Oe. PM and AF stand for paramagnetism and antiferromagnetism, respectively. mSR measurements indicate that the Mn moments for the x1⁄40.48 sample are in a highly disordered fashion even at 1.8 K. The samples with 14x4 0.5 are most likely to be a mixture between the LiMn2O4 and Li0.5Mn2O4 phases, while those with 0.5Zx40 are a mixture between the Li0.5Mn2O4 and Li0Mn2O4 phases. The combination of neutron scattering/heat capacity/mSR measurements would be crucial to elucidate the whole magnetic nature of LixMn2O4. K. Mukai et al. / Journal of Solid State Chemistry 184 (2011) 1096–1104 1103 transition Tf rapidly drops to 25 K even at yr0.05, and then decreases almost linearly with further increasing y [24,30]. Here, the excess Li ions at the 16d site (y) in Li[LiyMn2y]O4 not only dilute the magnetic interaction but also increase the Vave Mn . Moreover, the value of ac for Li[LiyMn2y]O4 decreases with increasing y [3]. Therefore, it is most likely that the dilution effect of the Li ions at the 16d, that is, z16d Mn significantly plays an important role for determining the magnetic phase diagram Li[LiyMn2y]O4. It is also interesting to note the difference in meff between LixMn2O4 and Li[LiyMn2y]O4. In contrast to LixMn2O4, meff for the Li[LiyMn2y]O4 compounds is significantly lower (0.5 mB) than mpre eff especially at yZ0.05 [24,25], although its origin is currently unknown. Finally, we wish to discuss the effect of Li mobility on the magnetism for LixMn2O4. In LixCoO2, one of the dynamic Kubo– Toyabe parameters D, which is obtained by fitting the ZF-mSR spectrum in a PM state, rapidly drops around 150 K [31]. Since 7Li-NMR experiment on LixCoO2 shows a step-like decrease in the NMR line width around 150 K [32], the change in D is caused by motional narrowing due to Liþ diffusion [31]. On the contrary, the T dependence of D exhibits a rapid decrease around 250 K for LiMn2O4 [28] and 230 K for Lix[Li0.04Mn1.96]O4 with x1⁄41 and 0.2 [27]. Although 7Li-NMR and/or mSR data above 200 K is currently unavailable for LixMn2O4, above mSR results indicates that the Liþ ions in the LixMn2O4 lattice are static below 200 K. 5. Conclusion We have examined the magnetic nature for the LixMn2O4 samples by magnetic susceptibility (w) and muon-spin rotation/ relaxation (mSR) measurements. It is clarified that Li0.5Mn2O4 enters into a disordered magnetic phase below 63 K. Therefore, there are three distinct phases in the magnetic phase diagram of LixMn2O4; the AF ordered phase with TN1⁄460 K for LiMn2O4, a disordered magnetic phase with Tm1⁄463 K for Li0.5Mn2O4, and the other AF ordered phase with TN1⁄432 K for Li0Mn2O4. In order to elucidate the magnetic nature of LixMn2O4, it is necessary to perform neutron scattering/heat capacity/mSR measurements at low temperatures. This is because w measurements below 60 K indicate that two sets of magnetic phase region exist in 14x4 0.5 and 0.54x40, whereas x dependences of meff and Yp change linearly with x in 1ZxZ0.6. Furthermore, we expect that w and mSR measurements for the delithiated Lix[LiyMn2y]O4 samples provide crucial information on complex magnetic properties of lithium manganese oxide spinels. Such experiments are still in progress in our research group. Acknowledgments We appreciate Prof. T. Ohzuku and Dr. K. Ariyoshi of Osaka City University for preparation of LixMn2O4.

The series of solid solutions of composition (12x)LiMn2O42xLi0.5Fe2.5O4 are single-phase products with the cubic spinel structure, with the lattice parameter increasing from 8.21 to 8.33 A_ as x varies from 0 and 1. The variation of the unit cell parameter with x shows a distinct departure from Vegard:s law, which is most pronounced for samples with the Fe : Mn molar ratio close to 1 : 1. With higher Fe content, the ordering of lithium ions in the octahedral spinel sites leads to the reduction of the crystal symmetry and to a strongly marked preference of Li1 ions to occupy the octahedral positions. Our lattice energy minimization results make clear predictions as to the Li1 ion content and distribution in these materials and thereby resolve confusions in the experimental data.

INTRODUCTION The system (1!x)LiMn2O4}xLi0.5Fe2.5O4 forms a continuous series of solid solutions with x varying from 0 to 1. In the stoichiometric cubic spinel LiMn2O4 (x"0), the Li` ions occupy the tetrahedral 8a sites, with a 1 : 1 mixture of Mn3` and Mn4` ions randomly distributed over the octahedral 16d positions in the spinel lattice (space group Fd3m) (1). Lithium ferrite, LiFe5O8 (x"1), is known to occur in two crystalline forms (2). The disordered Li0.5Fe2.5O4 has an inverse spinel structure, with Fe3` at the tetrahedral 8a positions and a 1 : 3 mixture of Li` and Fe3` ions at the octahedral 16d positions. In the &&ordered 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: smw@ri.ac.uk. spinel'' form (space group P4132, P4332), the Fe3` ions are at octahedral 12d and tetrahedral 8c sites, and the Li` ions occupy the octahedral 4b positions (3). Furthermore, as x increases in the single-phase compounds, there is a tendency for ordering of lithium in the B sites, which is related to the reduction of symmetry (4}6). The cation distribution over a spinel lattice of the whole (1!x)LiMn2O4}xLi0.5Fe2.5O4 solid solution series has been determined recently by di!raction techniques, using structure factors obtained from measurements of the integrated intensities of individual X-ray re#ections (4, 5), and by structure re"nement, using the Rietveld pro"le analysis (6). There are di!erences, however, in the precise determination of the Li` ion content per unit cell and in the distribution of lithium ions over the cationic sites of the spinel lattice, depending on the method of measurements used. In particular, analysis of di!raction data using Rietveld re"nement yields Li` occupancies that corresponds to an excess lithium content, which is not found when the data are analysed using integrated intensities. The di!erences in the apparent Li` occupancies obtained from powder X-ray di!raction are not unreasonable, as lithium is a poor X-ray scatterer. For this reason, the present paper describes the application of computational methods, which are based upon lattice energy calculations that employ interatomic potentials (7), to enable a comparison of structural parameters determined by X-ray di!raction and ultimately to resolve the discrepancies found in the results for the Li` distribution. 2. METHODS 2.1. Experimental Details Samples of solid solutions with the composition (1!x)LiMn2O4}xLi0.5Fe2.5O4 were prepared from mixtures 310 0022-4596/00 $35.00 Copyright ( 2000 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. FIG. 1. Observed, calculated, and di!erence pro"les, resulting from the Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder di!raction data collected on the (1!x)LiMn2O4}xLi0.5Fe2.5O4 samples, with X"0.0, 0.7, and 1.0. of iron}manganese oxide precursors, with appropriate quantities of Li2CO3, by thermal treatment at 600}7503C in air, using procedures described in detail previously (4}6). Because the Fe/(Fe#Mn) molar ratio for each sample is known, we have chosen this value (X) to label the samples. X-ray di!raction patterns of polycrystalline samples were recorded with a computerized HZG-3 (TUR-61) di!ractometer, employing the Mn-"ltered FeKa radiation. The structural re"nements were performed using the Rietveld program package GSAS (8, 9). Data from 103 to 903 (2h) with resolution of 0.043 (2h) were included in the calculations. 2.2. Computational Details All calculations performed in this study employed the static lattice computer code GULP 1.2 (10}12), which is based on the Born model of the ionic lattice, and from which the structural and crystal properties may be calculated using standard static lattice procedures. The calculation of the lattice energy is split into two parts: the long-range electrostatic term and the short-range interactions. For the latter, it is su$cient to sum in real space with a 25 A_ cuto!. However, for the electrostatic part, which converges slowly, the Ewald summation (13,14) is employed which transforms the summation into two rapidly convergent series: one in real space, and one in reciprocal space. The resulting lattice energy is minimized with respect to both cell dimensions and atomic coordinates using a Newton}Raphson procedure together with the BFGS method (15) of updating the Hessian. The short-range interactions are described using the standard pairwise Buckingham potential: <(r)"A exp (!r/o)!Cr~6, (where r is the distance between ions) together with the shell model (16), where a free ion is described as a point charge coupled with a force constant k to a massless shell with charge > in order to generate an ionic polarization of >2/k. The parameters A, o, C, k, and > are derived using empirical "tting procedures, as will be discussed in greater detail in Section 3. An important feature of the system studied here is that several sites show partial occupancies. In order to handle this problem, we have used a mean "eld theory whereby each site experiences a potential that is the average of all possible con"gurations on the disordered positions as discussed by Gale (11). This approach is considerably simpler than the alternative of modelling a large supercell, although we should point out that this simplicity comes at the expense of an acceptable loss in accuracy in the calculations. 3.

A decrease of the intensity ratio of I111/I311 lines indicates the removal of lithium ions from tetrahedral to octahedral sites, i.e., the transformation of a normal spinel (LiMn2O4) into an inverse spinel (LiFe5O8), with the increase of Fe3` content. The additional re#ections (110, 210, 211, 221), visible on the X-ray pattern of sample with X"1.0, are due to the 1 : 3 ordering of lithium cations in octahedral positions, resulting in the reduction of the crystal symmetry from the Fd3m to the P4132 (P4332) space group, when the Fe/(Fe#Mn) molar ratio exceeds 0.65, that is, for 0.6514x41.0. The samples investigated have been classi"ed into two di!erent sets referred to above. The "rst consists of those with molar ratio 0.04X40.6, for which all re#ections can be indexed according to the space group Fd3m. The X-ray patterns of the second set, with 0.74X41.0, are characterized by the additional re#ections attributed to lithium cation ordering (3), and can be assigned to the space group P4132 (P4332). Structural and cell parameters from the Rietveld pro"le re"nement of both sets of X-ray powder patterns are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

FIG. 2. Distribution of lithium ions over the spinel cationic positions, determined from Rietveld re"nement, per unit cell, A8[B16]O32. Li(T)}Li` in A (8a, Fd3m) sites; Li(O)}Li` in B (16d, Fd3m) sites; Li (12d) and Li (4b) are the octahedral 12d and 4b sites of P4132 space group, respectively. determined by Rietveld analysis (Tables 3 and 4) are in line with the increase of lattice constants and with the decrease in the values of the oxygen u parameter. The occupancy of manganese in 16d (B) sites, for the sample with X"0.0 (x"0.0), is in good agreement with the arrangement Li[Li1@3Mn5@3]O4, in which 13 of the Li` ions compensate the oxidation of Mn3` to Mn4` (17). In Fig. 2, the distribution of Li` ions over a range of sites is given together with the total lithium content, deduced from the Rietveld analysis. The increase of the Fe3` content in the samples appears to be associated with a decrease of the total lithium content and with a simultaneous migration of Li` from tetrahedral to octahedral sites. The preference of Li` to occupy Wycko! 4b positions is strongly marked only in samples with X'0.65, although the X-ray re#ections characteristic of the cubic primitive unit cell appear already for lower X values, e.g., for X"0.7. The results presented above reveal marked di!erences in the Li` distributions obtained by the two di!erent X-ray methods, i.e., by measurements of the integrated intensities of individual X-ray lines as performed previously (4) and by the line-pro"le re"nement with the Rietveld method (6). In particular, results for the former method for the "rst member of the solid solution, LiMn2O4, are consistent with the nearly stoichiometric lithium content in this sample (4,5), while from Rietveld analysis there appears to be an excess of Li`, which may be expressed by the formula Li4@3Mn5@3O4. These divergent results could be explained by the uncertainty in the determination of the crystallographic positions of such light atoms as lithium by X-ray di!raction techniques. In an attempt to understand the factors a!ecting the cation distribution in the spinel lattice, we applied our computer modeling techniques. The procedure involved minimising the lattice energy, as explained above, for each proposed structure for the series X"0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 2, 1.0 and investigating how the Li`, Fe3`, Mn3`, and Mn4` ion distributions on the octahedral sites a!ected the lattice parameters. For each sample we modeled the spinel structure (which has no oxygen vacancies) in two di!erent ways: Li` DISTRIBUTION IN QUATERNARY Li}Mn}Fe}O SPINELS 313 TABLE 5 Core+Shell Spring Constant k and the Charge on the Shell Y Used in the Shell Model for an Ion G and the Parameters Used in the Buckingham Potential between the O22 Ion and an Ion G G A (eV) o (A_ ) C (eV A_ ~6) > (e) k (eV A_ ~2) Li`A 426.480 0.3000 0.00 Li`B 479.837 0.3000 0.00 Fe3` A 1240.232 0.3069 0.00 1.029 10082.50 Fe3` B 1342.754 0.3069 0.00 1.029 10082.50 Mn3` 1686.125 0.2962 0.00 1.029 148.00 Mn4` 3087.826 0.2642 0.00 O2~ 22.41 0.6937 32.32 !2.513 20.53 a The subscript A or B indicates that the respective cation is in a tetrahedral or octahedral environment.

(a) Lattice energy values and (b) unit cell parameters of the spinel solid solutions (1!x)LiMn2O4}xLi0.5Fe2.5O4 for stoichiometric (s and sb) and nonstoichiometric (n and nb) molar ratios of the cations and for that observed by X-ray di!raction data (o). The label b implies that the Li`B refer the 4b sites. with stoichiometric quantities (x"0.000, 0.082, 0.167, 0.255, 0.348, 0.444, 0.545, 0.651, 0.762, 0.878, 1.000) and then with the cation distribution close to that predicted by our Rietveld re"nement. For each value of X, the same Fe3`/Li` molar ratio for the tetrahedral 8c sites was used for both sets. In order to change the lithium content on the octahedral sites, we varied the Mn4`/Mn3` molar ratio whilst maintaining a total charge of zero for the unit cell, full occupancies on the 8c and 16d sites (vacancies would not help us model excess Li`) and the molar ratio Fe/(Fe#Mn) constrained to the value X. Our initial approach was to use literature parameter values (12, 18) of A, o, C, k, and > for the Li`}O2~, Fe3`}O2~, Mn4`}O2~, and O2}O2~ interactions and derive parameters for the Mn3`}O2~ term. Our criterion was the reproduction of structural parameters with X"1.0 (LiFe5O8) and X"0.3 (Li1~0.5xFe2.5xMn2~2xO4 with x"0.255), the two members for which the cation distributions are known most accurately. Using our "tted potentials the lattice parameters for these compositions are reproduced to within 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively. However, when the parameters for Mn3`}O2~ were "tted to reproduce the structure of X"0.3 (x"0.255), the resulting potentials produced poor lattice parameters for the binary oxide a-Mn2O3 with the bixbyite structure. To increase transferability (a requirement if we are to model reliably the other members of the series), we decided to re"ne the literature values to maximize the agreement of the lattice parameters for X"1.0 and X"0.3 while allowing a maximum di!erence in the lattice parameter of 1.6% for the binary oxides a-Fe2O3, c-Fe2O3, b-MnO2 (rutile structure), and a-Mn2O3. In order to achieve this condition, we needed to re"ne a di!erent A parameter for Fe3`}O2~ when the cation is in an octahedral rather than a tetrahedral coordinated environment and likewise with the Li`}O2~ term. Our "tted parameters are given in Table 5. As expected, the A parameter for the tetrahedrally coordinated sites are smaller than the A parameter for the octahedrally coordinated sites. The di!erence between the observed and calculated unit cell parameters of the binary oxides is at most 1.54%. Although the variations of the observed lattice parameter across the solid solution series we are investigating are smaller we would expect that the errors in our calculated lattice parameters are systematic and constant and as such will not a!ect our conclusions as to the Li` occupancies. 314 WOODLEY ET AL.

The total Li` content per unit cell, in samples with 0.04X40.3, resulting from Rietveld re"nement (see Fig. 2) surpasses the stoichiometric ratio (e.g., 11 Li` per unit cell for X"0.0). As mentioned above, this "nding was not con"rmed by other methods (4, 5). We have calculated the lattice energy and the unit-cell parameters for systems where the lithium content is as close to that suggested by Rietveld re"nement (e.g., the maximum, 102/3, Li` per unit cell for X"0.0 was modeled) and for those with stoichiometric compositions. Our initial calculations were also performed assuming the Li` distributions to be both random over just the 4b sites and random over the 16d (4b#12d) sites. The results, shown in Fig. 3, give a good illustration of the changes in the lattice energy and the unit-cell parameter for the solid solution series. We can use this information to resolve the "rst of two key structural issues, the ordering of the lithium ions. Comparing the lattice energies, for the structures with the Li` content close to that predicted by Rietveld re"nement, suggests that the lithium ions (not on the tetrahedral 8c sites) prefer the 4b sites although the energy di!erence drops to 0.4 eV for X"0.4. This trend is perhaps clearer when comparing the lattice energies for the structures with stoichiometric Li` content, except for X(0.35 where there are no Li` on the octahedral sites to distribute. For both sets, the energy di!erence is generally greater for higher values of X, suggesting that the Li` on octahedral sites for samples with higher values of X are more likely to prefer to be on 4b sites, in agreement with the experimental data discussed above. The lattice parameters for the lower energetic structures (in which Li` is not distributed on the 12d sites) are also closer to those observed from the X-ray di!raction data. However, upon comparing the observed and predicted lattice parameters there is still a marked di!erence especially for X(0.15 and X'0.55. Moreover, the lattice parameter is very sensitive to the lithium content. Since the observed lattice parameter for 0(X(0.15 is bounded by our calculated values for the lattice parameter, we decided to vary the lithium content on the 4b sites such Li` DISTRIBUTION IN QUATERNARY Li}Mn}Fe}O SPINELS 315 that the calculated lattice parameter matched that observed from the X-ray di!raction data, as shown in Fig. 4. Again, we kept the following constraints: zero total charge within the unit cell, Fe/(Fe#Mn)"X, and full site occupancies. Thus, by tuning the Li` content so as to map the variation of the observed lattice parameter, we were able to resolve the second of the two key structural issues; the quantity of Li` on the 4b sites. The calculated cation distribution for each sample, X, is presented in Table 6. In general, when comparing our calculated data with that suggested by our Rietveld re"nement, we have predicted a slight increase of the lithium content on the B sites. However, for X"0.0 (where Rietveld suggested a content which was larger than that physically possible) and X"0.1 we predicted a reduction in the lithium content on the B site and no change for X"0.3 and X"1.0 (as these were used to "t our potential parameters). 4. CONCLUSIONS Computer modeling studies together with X-ray powder di!raction structure re"nement provided an insight into the real structure of the system of solid solutions formed between the LiMn2O4 and LiFe5O8 spinel oxides. Evaluation and re"nement of the Mn`}O2~ interatomic potentials, by taking into consideration the dependence on the coordination of the cations, allowed a consistent interpretation of the experimental data, but shows that the Li` occupancies obtained by Rietveld re"nement are inaccurate. Knowing the lattice parameter of the samples and Li` distribution over the tetrahedral sites, it was possible to predict the Li` ordering and cation occupations on the octahedral spinel positions. A neutron di!raction study is planned to test our predictions.

SPINEL-RELATED PHASES: Li2Mn204 AND Lio,zMnz04 317 Jahn-Teller distortion at room temperature that lowers the crystal symmetry of Lit+,[Mn2]04 from cubic (space group = Fd3m) to tetragonal (space group = 141/ amd). An initial structure determination with powder X-ray diffraction data has indicated, despite the low scattering power of X-rays by lithium, that in tetragonal Li2[Mn2]04 the Li+ ions are almost randomly distributed over both the tetrahedral A-sites and interstitial octahedral sites of the spine1 structure. In contrast, it was concluded from a subsequent neutron-diffraction study by Mosbah et al. that all the Li+ ions in Li2[Mn2]04 are situated on octahedral sites, resulting in an ordered rocksalt structure (5). Lithium extraction from the tetrahedral A-sites of Li[Mn2]04 proceeds smoothly with a continuously decreasing “a” lattice parameter to x = 0.5 in Li1-,[Mn2]04 (6). A sudden decrease in the lattice parameter near this composition indicates a phase transition, the exact nature of which has not yet been established. Electrochemical extraction beyond the composition Lio.s[Mnz]O., has been shown to be difficult, even at low current rates (6). Evidence for stabilized spinel-related compositions A,&B2]X4 has been established, for example, in Ga&Mo2]& in which the MO ions dimerize along the (110) axes to form tetrahedral clusters (7). An ordering of the tetrahedral-site vacancies into one of the two Asite subarrays can be expected in the compositional range 0 < x 5 0.5. The purpose of determining the structures of Li2[Mn2]04 and Li0.2[Mn2]04 with neutron diffraction data was therefore twofold: (i) to obtain more substantial evidence for the unusual coexistence of Li+ ions in faceshared tetrahedra and octahedra of a cubicclose-packed oxygen array, thereby resolving previous contrasting reports on the location of the Li+ ions in Li2[Mn2]04, and (ii) to search for structural features in extensively delithiated Lir-,[Mnz]04 samples, e.g., superlattice reflections due to Li+-ion ordering that could account for the phase transition that occurs at LiWO.~[MnzO~. A composition Li-,&Mnz]O~ was selected for structure analysis as delithiated samples Lil-,[Mn2]04 with 0.5 5 x 5 0.7 tend to be two-phase: they consist of partially delithiated (x < 0.5) and extensively delithiated (x > 0.5) particles. Experimental Li[Mnz]Od was prepared in air by solid state reaction of L&CO3 (Alfa Products, 99.5%) and Mn,?O, (Koch Light, 98%) in the molar ratio 1 : 2. After calcining at 650°C for 12 hr, the sample was heated at 850°C for 24 hr. Li2[Mn2]04 was synthesized by chemical lithiation of Li[Mn2]04 with an excess of n-butyl-lithium (Koch Light, 15w/w in hexane) in sodium-dried hexane at 50°C for several days under a nitrogen atmosphere. After reaction, the product was thoroughly washed with hexane, dried under vacuum, and stored under an argon atmosphere. Li0.2[Mn2]04 was prepared by a method described by Hunter (2). 13.2 g Li[Mn2]04 in 350 ml water was reacted with 110 ml 4.5N H2S04 until the solution reached pH = 1. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 hr. The lithium concentration in the lithiated and delithiated spine1 phases was obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The compositions of the two compounds were determined by this method to be Li2.0S[Mn2104 and L&.26[Mn2]04, respectively. Approximately 7 g of sample was loaded into vanadium cans, 16 mm in diameter, and sealed with indium wire. Neutron-diffraction data were collected on the highresolution powder diffractometer DlA at the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France. The neutron wavelengths used for data collection of Liz[Mnz]04 and 318 DAVID ET AL. Li&Mn2]04 were 1.3840 and 1.5082 A, respectively . Structures were refined with a profile-refinement program modified to describe peak shape by a Voigt function, which is a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions (8). The former function describes, to a good approximation, the constant-wavelength neutron-diffraction peak shape; the Lorentzian component to the peak shape arises because of particle-size effects. The Voigt function is particularly relevant to this work as intercalation and deintercalation of lithium with Li[MnJ04 are accompanied by a substantial reduction in particle size (9, 10). Neutron-scattering amplitudes used in the structure refinement were b(Li) = -0.2030 x lo-i2 cm, b(Mn) = -0.3730 x IO-l2 cm, and b(0) = 0.5804 x lo-i2cm (II). Initial unit-cell parameters were obtained from previously reported X-ray diffraction data for A-Mn02 and Li2[Mn2]04 (2, 4). During structure refinement, all parameters were refined simultaneously. In tetragonal Li2[Mn2]04, nine profile and six structural parameters were refined; in cubic Li0.2[Mn2]Od the number of refined profile and structural parameters were eight and four, respectively. Results and Discussion The structure of Li2[Mn2]04 was refined with the space group F4,/ddm, which defines a face-centered tetragonal cell equivalent to the smaller body-centered cell with space group 14Jamd. For the sake of simplicity and consistency with cubic Li&Mnz]04, the site positions of the atoms are given, throughout this discussion, in terms of the aristotype cubic spine1 space group, Fd3m. In this space group with the spine1 notation, the tetrahedral A-type cations reside on the 8a sites, the octahedral B-type cations on the 16d sites, and the oxygen anions on the 32e sites; the interstitial octahedra of the spine1 structure are located at the 16~ positions. An important feature of the spine1 structure is that each 8a tetrahedron shares all four faces with empty 16~ octahedra. It is thus easy to visualize that insertion of lithium ions into the spine1 structure can lead to a cooperative displacement of the A-cations into octahedral sites (16~) and that this process leaves an ordered rocksalt structure after the addition of one lithium: Li + &d32116d04 * b~l16c[~2116d04. The manganese ions were constrained to the B-sites of the spine1 structure during all stages of the refinement in keeping with previous data (4, 5). The following two models were used as a starting set to refine the structure of Li2[Mn2]04: Model I. All 16~ octahedral sites filled by lithium, and all 8a tetrahedral sites empty; Model ZZ. A random occupancy by lithium of both 8a tetrahedra and 16~ octahedral sites, consistent with the stoichiometry Li2[Mn2]04. Refinement of both models converged to a best fit between observed and calculated data that corresponded to occupancy of both 8a and 16~ by lithium. Refinements with an isotropic temperature factor for lithium set arbitrarily at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 A2 gave similar occupancy of both 8a and 16~ sites. In particular, with B = 2.0 A2 the occupancies of the 8a and 16~ sites were 0.43(5) and 0.79(2), respectively, which gives a stoichiometry L&,Mn204; this is in good agreement with the stoichiometry Li2.0SMn204 determined by chemical analysis. With B = 4.0 A2 the 8u-site occupancy increased to 0.52(6) and the 16csite occupancy to 0.88(4), the latter still being significantly less than unity; in this case the sum of the occupancies is rather high, viz, 2.28(10). Attempts to constrain the lithium content to 2.0 and allowing the B SPINEL-RELATED PHASES: LizMn204 AND L&.2Mn204 TABLE I STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS OF Li2.,JMn2]04 Space Group: F4,lddm; a = 7.994(l) A, c = 9.329 (1) A Atom Position” X Y Z B(k) n Li(l) 8a 0.1250 0.1250 0.1250 2.0 0.43(5) Li(2) 16~ o.oooo 0.0000 0.0000 2.0 0.79(3) Mn 16d 0.5000 0.5000 0.5000 0.45(5) 1.0 0 32e 0.2589(2) 0.2589(2) 0.2530(2) 0.55(2) 1.0 Note.

A comparison of the observed neutron diffraction profile of (a) Liz[Mn2]04 with the simulated patterns of (b) Lisa(Li)i~[Mn&r04 and (c) (LiZ)16c[Mn2]16d04. The presence of the 11 0 31 and 13 0 51 reflections in the observed profile is indicative of lithium occupation of both tetrahedral sites (8a) and octahedral sites (16~). the two simulated structures are similar, the presence of two weak reflections [l 0 31 and [3 0 51 in Li8a(Li)16c[Mn2]04, which are absent (or extremely weak) in (Li2)r6JMn2]04, serve to identify the correct model; the presence of these two reflections in the observed profile of Li2[MnJ04 (Fig. 2a) thus confirms the tetrahedral-site occupation by lithium. The occupation of both 8a and 16c sites by lithium is also unequivocally confirmed by the difference Fourier map shown in Fig. 3. This map, which corresponds to a difference between observed and calculated structure factors based on the starting Model I (all 16c occupancy by lithium), is a section at height 0 perpendicular to [l 1 0] that contains all possible occupied sites @a, 16c, 164 and 32e) in a spinel/rocksalt structure. Figure 3 clearly indicates appreciable negative scattering from the 8a sites along with a small positive contribution from the 16c sites. This negates the proposal of solely octahedral occupancy by lithium in Li2[Mn2]04 and, as a corollary, corroborates the evidence of partial occupancy of both ga (tetrahedral) and 16c (octahedral) sites by lithium obtained directly from profile refinement of the present data and intensity refinement of previous X-ray data (4).

SPINEL-RELATED PHASES: Li2Mn204 AND Li0.zMn204 321 It is of interest to compare this result with the closely related systems Lil+JV2]04 and Lil+JTi2]04 (0 < x I 1). In the system Lil+JV2]04, electrochemical and powder X-ray diffraction data indicate that, at a composition Li1.5[V2]04, the Li+ ions reside in both the tetrahedral @a) and octahedral (16~) sites, which is consistent with the findings of the Lii+,[Mn2]04 system (12). For x > 0.5 the Li+ ions in the tetrahedral sites are displaced into the remaining empty octahedra (16~) to yield rocksalt structure (Li2)16c[V2]16d04 in which the original [&]04 spine1 framework is maintained. In the system Lil+JTi2]04, neutron-diffraction data of Li2[Ti2]04 show that, as in Li2[V2]04, the structure has a rocksalt configuration with the cations occupying all available octhedral sites (13); no structural information is available yet for intermediate compositions in the range 0 < x < 1. In the spine1 structure the octahedral Bsite cations are situated farthest from the tetrahedrally coordinated A-cations. This data thus shows that in Liz[Mn2]04 the inserted lithium ions occupy the 16~ sites and that the electrostatic Mn$&Li+ interactions are still sufficiently strong to keep a fraction of the lithium ions on the 8a sites. The refined structure necessitates, therefore, the coexistence of lithium ions in faceshared tetrahedra and octahedra despite a very short Li&-Li&, interatomic distance of only 1.83 A. This finding demonstrates the near equivalence in potential energy of the 8a and 16~ sites at this composition, which is not surprising as the lithium ions in Lil+.[Mnz]O~ (0 5 x 5 1) move through the 8a16~ network. Coexistence of Li+ ions on neighboring sites 16~ and 8a would be stabilized by a relaxation of the ions from the center of site symmetry toward a site face adjacent to a vacant site. It follows that an octahedralsite Li+ ion would only have one tetrahedral-site Li+-ion nearest neighbor and a tetrahedral-site Li+ ion need have only one of .*. . . 8.2 /. . . . .:‘, / ..X , “a” ( a ) .X" ..X ,:: /; ,.: f' 7 , ,&' .i . ..80 I 1.0 0.5 0.0 x in Li ,-~ Mn204 FIG. 4.

Hunter (2). its four nearest neighbor octahedral sites vacant. A maximum tetrahedral-site occupancy of 50% and octahedral-site occupancy of 75% could be achieved in an ordered system having only one of the two tetrahedral-site subarrays occupied. With disorder, a tetrahedral-site occupancy somewhat less than 50% must be anticipated; this prediction is consistent with observed tetrahedraland octahedralsite occupancies of 43(5) and 79(3)%, respectively. Previous studies have shown that lithium can be extracted from Li[Mnt]04 over the range 0 5 x I 1 (2, 5). Complete removal of lithium from Li[MnZ]04 results in hMnO2. A plot of our data of the “a” lattice parameter vs composition, x, in Lii-,[Mn2]04 shows a linear decrease in “a” to x = 0.5 (Fig. 4). At x = 0.5, “a” decreases sharply from 8.14 to -8.05 A and thereafter decreases more slowly to 8.03 A at X-Mn02. Although no deviation from the cubic symmetry of space group Fd3m has yet been detected over the entire range of delithiation, it has been proposed, because of the existence of the spinel-related phase 322 DAVID ET AL.

The refined lattice parameter of this compound is 8.0215(l) A which, surprisingly, is less than the value of 8.03 A for LiO.OzMnOz reported by Hunter and Mosbah (2, 5). The absence in the diffraction profile of Li&Mn2]04 of any reflections h 0 0 (h = 2n) that are systematically absent in space group Fd3m (centrosymmetric), but present in FT3m (noncentrosymmetric) precludes the possibility of detecting any Li+-ion ordering equivalent to the Ga ordering in Ga0.5 [MO.&,. Structural models refined with space group F43m led to no improvement in the fit between the observed and calculated diffraction data. Refinement of the structure with space group Fd3m indicated that the lithium ions were distributed randomly with a site occupancy of 19% over all the tetrahedral 8a sites; attempts to refine these ions on the octahedral 16~ sites led to a negative site occupancy. Final profile and structural parameters are listed in Table II. This result still leaves open the possibility of an order-disorder transition for the Asite vacancies at x = 0.5. A measurement for a sample with 0 < x < 0.5 is needed to confirm whether the initial removal of Li+ ions in the system Lil-,[Mn2]04 leaves the A-site vacancies ordered on one of the two A-site subarrays as x approaches 0.5.

The lattice parameter, the oxygen parameter and the infrared spectrum as well as the temperature dependence of the resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, the magnetic properties and neutron diffraction have been studied. 1. Einleitung Die Herstellung sowie die kristallographischen Eigenschaften des Spinells Li[Mn3+Mn4+]04 wurden bereits von Wickham and Croft (2) angegeben. Ferner wurde von diesen Autoren eine SBttigungsmagnetisierung bei Raumtemperatur von Null gefunden. Dieser Befund ist aufgrund der Ladungsverteilung, nach der sieben ungepaarte Elektronen vorhanden sein sollten, nicht zu erwarten. Die magnetischen Eigenschaften wurden daher in der vorliegenden Arbeit erneut untersucht und durch Neutronenbeugungsuntersuchungen ergtinzt. Dariiberhinaus wurden die elektronischen Eigenschaften und deren TemperaturabhHngigkeit bestimmt. 2. Untersuchungsergebnisse 2.1.

Die Bildung des Spinells Li[MnJO, an Luft als Funktion der Temperatur aus einer entsprechenden Mischung von Li2C03 (p.a. Merck) und Mn304 (aus Mn(N03)2 * 6 Hz0 p.a. Merck) wurde mit Hilfe einer GuinierSimon-Hochtemperaturkamera untersucht. Die Spinellbildung beginnt bereits unterhalb 773”K, wie das Auftreten des (1 1 1)-Reflexes (des stHrksten Reflexes des Li[Mnz]04) zeigt. Ab ca. 873°K treten die ntichstsdrkeren Reflexe ((311), (400) und (440)) der Verbindung auf. Die scharfen Reflexe, die gleichbleibenden Reflexintensititen und das Verschwinden der Reflexe der Ausgangssubstanzen zeigten, dafi die gesamte Festkiirperreaktion nach 24 Stunden bei 1073°K abgeschlossen war. Analog verlief die Reaktion, wenn anstelle des Mn304 MnO oder MnOz eingesetzt wurden. Damit konnten die Angaben von Wickham und Croft (2) best& tigt und ergHnzt werden. 227 Die mittlere Oxidationsstufe der Manganionen im LiMnz04, die nach der Bunsen-Methode (3) bestimmt wurde, betrug bei der Darstellung an Luft 3.48, bei der Darstellung unter Sauerstoff atmosphlre 0022-4596/79/020227-05$02.0010 Copyright @ 1979 by Academic Press.

Die Gitterkonstante weist im Bereich von 130°K bis 1070°K eine lineare Anderung von 822 bis 831 pm auf. Die Beugungsuntersuchungen mit Neutronen bestatigen die oben angegebenen, aus Riintgenbeugungsuntersuchungen gefundenen Werte (s. Abb. 1). Im Temperaturbereich von 4.2”K bis 373°K wurden keine magnetischen Reflexe gefunden, wie sie bei den antiferromagnetischen Verbindungen ZnMnzOb (5) und MgMn204 (5) bzw. bei der ferrimagnetischen Verbindung Mn304 (6) auftreten. 2.2 Elektronische und magnetische Eigenschaften Die Messungen an polykristallinen Sinterkorpern des Spinells Li[Mnz]Od ergaben fiir die Thermokraft (-158* 10) pV/K und fiir den spezifischen Widerstand (4000* 1500) fi. cm.

Diskussion Im Gegensatz zu den analog zusammengesetzten Spinellen Li[Tiz]Od (8) und Li[V2]04 (9), die jeweils Thermokrlfte urn Null pV/K und geringe spezifische Widerstlnde besitzen, wird fiir das Li[Mnz]Od mit -158 uV/K eine hohe negative Thermokraft und mit ca. 4 * lo3 R. cm ein hoher spezifischer Widerstand gefunden. Dieses unterschiedliche Verhalten wird durch eine Analyse der Metall-Metall-Abstande auf den Oktaederplatzen des Spinellgitters erklart (Tab. I): sie liegen mit 296.9 pm beim Li[Tiz]Oa bzw. 291.5 pm beim Li[V2]04 weit unter den von Goodenough (10) definierten kritischen Abstanden von 302 pm bzw. 294 pm und bedingen somit den metallischen Charakter der Verbindungen. Dagegen liegt der Mangan-Mangan-Abstand im Li[Mnz]Ob mit 291.5 pm weit iiber dem kritischen Abstand von 272 pm, so da(3 halbleitende Eigenschaften zu erwarten sind. Diese Ergebnisse werden durch die IRAbsorptionsspektren (Abb. 4) bestatigt. Fiir die metallischen Leiter Li[Tiz]Od und Li[V2]04 wird, wie zu erwarten (II), kontinuierliche Absorption, fiir Li[Mnz]Oh dagegen werden die zwei im untersuchten Spektralbereich fiir halbleitende Spinelle typischen Banden, die hier bei 610 und 500 cm-’ liegen, gefunden. Zur Deutung der magnetischen und elektronischen Eigenschaften des Spinells Li[Mnz]Od wird davon ausgegangen, daJ3 die Verbindung mit der Ladungsverteilung Li[Mn3+Mn4+]04 vorliegt (2). Unter Vernachlassigung der Bahnmomente sollte man bei im Kristall gleichsjnnig ausgerichteten Momenten sieben ungepaarte Elektronen erwarten. Die Auswertung der magnetischen Messungen ergibt dagegen, dafl im Mittel nur 5.4 ungepaarte Elektronen pro Formeleinheit vorhanden sind. Dieser experimentelle Befund lifit sich so deuten, daj3 ca. 80% der Mn3+-Ionen im low-spinZustand (LS-Zustand, t&e”,) und nur ca. 20% im high-spin-Zustand (HS-Zustand, t$+i) vorliegen. Diese Deutung der magnetischen Messungen wird durch eine Analyse der Thermokraft bestiitigt.

Die relativ hohe negative Thermokraft des Li[Mn2]04 bedeutet, da0 nur ein geringer Teil der formal vorhandenen Mn3+-Ionen fiir den Leitungsprozefl zur Verfiigung steht.

Wird der Anteil der Mn3+-Ionen im LS-Zustand mit L bezeichnet, ist das Li[Mn2]04 als Li[Mn:?tMnrMn4+]04 zu formulieren. Damit sind die Zahl der besetzbaren Platze N = 2 -L und die Zahl der besetzten PlPtze it = 1 -L. Aus der oben angegebenen Formel zur Berechung der Thermokraft wird damit unter Vernachlassigung des Transportgliedes eine Ladungstriigerkonzentration von 0.15 mol pro Formeleinheit ermittelt, d.h. eine Analyse der experimentell bestimmten Thermokraft ergibt, daJ3 15% bzw. 85% der Mn3+-Ionen im HS-bzw. im LS-Zustand vorliegen. Die Temperaturabhiingigkeit des spezifischen Widerstandes und der Thermokraft kann ebenfalls mit dem vorstehend beschriebenen Model1 erklirt werden: versteht man nach Heikes und Johnston (14) den Leitungsvorgang als thermisch aktivierten Platzwechsel mit einer zugeordneten Sprungfrequenz, so folgt aus der Temperaturabhangigkeit des spezifischen Widerstandes die Temperaturabhangigkeit der Beweglichkeit der Ladungstrlger, da die Thermokraft nahezu temperaturunabhangig ist. Diese geringe Temperaturabhangigkeit der Thermokraft 1HjQ sich zwanglos durch eine Temperaturabhlngigkeit des Gleichgewichtes Mn3+(LS) $ Mn3+ (HS) erkllren. Die Konzentration der Mn3’-Ionen im HSZustand nimmt im Bereich von 295°K bis 167°K von 0.15 auf 0.12 mol pro Formeleinheit ab.

INTRODUCTION Spine1 structure Li-Mn-0 compounds are the most promising 4-V cathodes for “lithium ion” batteries because they are cheaper, less toxic, and easier to prepare than their alternatives. A problem which prevents these compounds from being applied on an industrial scale is their unstable rechargeability. Even though the rechargeability has been greatly improved by several research groups (l-3), capacity fading on cycling was also observable for those stoichiometric spinels. This was attributed to the fact that a LiMn,O, electrode dissolves slowly into the electrolyte solution (2). In this paper, we report on new phenomenon in which capacity fading on cycling for those stoichiometric spinels occurs only at a higher charge plateau, and the capacity loss was almost arrested for those nonstoichiometric spinels which were obtained by the melt-impregnation method. EXPERIMENTAL All samples examined here were prepared by the melt-impregnation method (1). Stoichiometric spine1 LiMn,O, (Sample A) was obtained from LiOH reacting with the chemically prepared manganese dioxide (International Common Sample, No. 12, Sedema, Belgium) (Li/ Mn = 0.5) at 470°C for 12 hr in air, and 700°C for 24 hr under N,. Nonstoichiometric spine1 Li,.,Mn,O, (Sample ’ To whom correspondence should be addressed. B) was synthesized from LiOH and CMD (Li/Mn = 0.52) at 470°C for 12 hr and 700°C for 24 hr in air. The composition of both samples was characterized by chemical analysis and atomic adsorption spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction was applied to determine the structure of the compounds and the changes in crystal structure at various charge depths of the resulting compounds with Fe& radiation, monochromated by a graphite crystal on a RigaKu RINTlOOO X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ltd., Japan). The composition of the cathode and the assembly of the cell were similar to those reported previously (1). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of powder X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that both samples characterize the signature of spinel. The chemical analysis values of both samples are Li,,,Mn,,,O, for Sample A and Li,,,Mn,,,O,,,, for Sample B. If Sample B is represented as Thackeray’s expression, Li1.WMn2.~Mn0,.,4 is defect spine1 Li,,0[MQ,%6 Li 0,0020,,,,,],0, in which vacancies exist in 16d octahedral sites in the structure. The typical charge and discharge profiles of the cell containing both samples at a current rate of C/3 are presented in Fig. 1. The results show that Sample A has a voltage profile of a spine1 electrode with the characteristic two-step process plateau at 4.05 and 4.16 V in the charge curve and delivers an initial charge capacity of about 140 mAh/g. Sample B provides a slightly lower capacity of about 110 mA hr/g with a quasi-one-step process. The cycling test for cells Li/l M LiPF,-EC/DMC (1: 2 in volume)/LiMn,O, containing Sample A and Sample B were examined in the button CR2032-type cells. Each cell was cycled at a current rate of C/3 between 3.5 and 4.5 V. The capacities of both samples are plotted as a function of cycle number in Fig. 2. The capacity fading of Sample A is somewhat faster than that of Sample B. Sample A loses about 12% initial capacity, and Sample B preserves about 98% initial capacity for the first 100 cycles. 216 0022-45%/95 $12.00 Copyright 0 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.

Typical charge and discharge curves for (A) Sample A and (B) Sample B at a current rate of C/3. We found that the capacity loss occurs only at a higher voltage plateau. To our knowledge, no information is known regarding this phenomenon. The Ist, 2nd, 25th, and 50th charge curves in the voltage range of 3.9 and 4.2 V are illustrated in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the capacity fading on cycling for a cell containing Sample A occurs only in region II, while the capacity at a lower voltage region (region I) always remains at 80 mA hr/g during cycling, corresponding to 0.55 molar Li+ insertion/extraction per unit. The shape of the charge curve in region II also gradually changes from an “L-shape” to an “S-shape,” indicating that a two-phase structure has a tendency to be transformed to a one-phase structure in this region. Simultaneously, the voltage also shifts to a higher value for lithium removal. The main factor causing capacity loss for a stoichiometric spine1 is proposed to be the removal/insertion of lithium from the spine1 framework, which needs higher energy compared to the first cycle and does not simply cause the dissolution of Mn ions into solution.

As described above, Sample A and Sample B have different battery performances; this should be attributed to their different crystal structures. To follow the changes in the crystal structure during the extraction of lithium ions from the spine1 framework, XRD diffraction was used to investigate the structural changes at various charge depths for both samples, after the cells were equilibrated for 10 days. The XRD patterns show that extraction of lithium ions from the spine1 results in a shift of the peaks to higher diffraction angles during the charge. The peaks for Sample A begin to split when being charged to x = 0.25 in Li,Mn,O,, whereas no split peaks were detected for Sample B over the entire examined region.

It is evident in Fig. 4A that a homogeneous phase reaction occurs in region I for 0.4 < x < 1.0 (a0 = 8.247-8.155 A), and two cubic phases (a, = 8.150 and 8.027 A) coexist in region II for 0.1 < x < 0.4, indicating that lithium ion insertion and extraction reactions proceed in the unstable two-phase region. In contrast, a homogeneous reaction occurring over the entire intercalated range (0.25 < x < 1.04) was detected for Sample B, as described in Fig. 4B. The lattice parameter a, decreases almost linearly from 8.219 to 8.105 A with two different slopes. These results strongly support the fact the capacity fading on cycling of Sample A occurring in the higher voltage region is due to the unstable two-phase region existing during lithium ion insertion and extraction from the spine1 framework, whereas a homogeneous structure for nonstoichiometric spine1 Li,,,Mn,,,,O, will result in excellent rechargeability.

ORIGINAL PAPER X-ray diffraction study on phase transition of orthorhombic LiMnO2 in electrochemical conversions X. Y. Tu & K. Y. Shu Received: 25 April 2007 /Revised: 4 June 2007 /Accepted: 15 June 2007 / Published online: 25 July 2007 # Springer-Verlag 2007 Abstract Orthorhombic LiMnO2 was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction. Phase transition during electrochemical process has been investigated using the high-resolution X-ray diffraction. Contrary to numerous earlier reports, phase analysis of the orthorhombic LiMnO2 electrode cycled for three times evidences the irreversible structure transition from orthorhombic LiMnO2 (Pmnm) to spinel LiMn2O4 (Fd3m) and rock salt Li0.5Mn0.5O (Fm 3 m). Here, the spinel structure with a cell parameter a=8.241 (1) Å has a large cationic disorder on lithium and manganese sites, i.e., about 9% of the Li positions are occupied by Mn and vice versa. For Li0.5Mn0.5O, the cell parameter is a= 4.121 (3) Å, and both Li+ and Mn3+ cations occupy the octahedral 4a sites with mole ratio 1:1. The quantity of Li0.5Mn0.5O phase is greatly dependent on cycling rate, namely, the higher the current density is, the larger the quantity of formed-rock salt structure is. Keywords Orthorhombic LiMnO2 . X-ray diffraction . Phase transition Introduction Due to its low cost and nontoxicity, lithium manganese oxides have attracted wide attention as cathode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion secondary batteries [1–3]. Although LiMn2O4 has been widely studied in the Li– Mn–O phase diagram [4–6], an increasing attention is also being paid to o-LiMnO2 (orthorhombic LiMnO2) having a zigzag β-NaMnO2 layered structure (space group Pmnm), due to a larger theoretical capacity (285 mA h g−1) of the former [7–12]. In the earlier reports, o-LiMnO2 prepared at low temperature (T<450 °C) showed high capacity about 200 mA h g−1, and in situ XRD (X-ray diffraction) study demonstrated that o-LiMnO2 converted to a spinel structure after the first cycle [13]. Furthermore, Gummow and Thackeray [14] confirmed the opinion of Reimer et al. that electrochemical cycling of o-LiMnO2 prepared at 300 °C resulted in a gradual phase transformation to spinel phase and suggested that the newly formed LiMn2O4 is significantly more tolerant to repeated lithium insertion and extraction. As mentioned above, subsequent studies had shown that cycling of o-LiMnO2 synthesized at high temperature (T>800 °C) induced a progressive phase transformation to spinel structure. In this regard, for the first time, they revealed that the cycle-induced spinel phase consisted of nanodomains confirmed by the observation of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy so that they played a significant role in maintaining a higher capacity in 3 V region [15, 16]. Moreover, by means of in situ XRD experiments, Kim et al. found that a sample with a high number of stacking faults underwent easier phase transformation from orthorhombic structure to spinel one on cycling. This form of o-LiMnO2 displayed no capacity fading in the 4 V region but suffered from severe capacity fading in the 3 V region [17]. More recently, in situ synchrotron diffraction showed that o-LiMnO2 transformed to a new phase during the first charge process, which was metastable and could easily convert to spinel LiMn2O4 in the following cycles [18]. The progressive formation of this spinel phase was responsible for the capacity increase in the battery in the initial cycles. J Solid State Electrochem (2008) 12:245–249 DOI 10.1007/s10008-007-0384-3 X. Y. Tu (*): K. Y. Shu Department of Materials Science and Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, People’s Republic of China e-mail: xiaoyantu@163.com From above reviews, it can be seen that electrochemical cycling of o-LiMnO2 compound, prepared at either low temperature or high temperature, often results in phase transformation that has a critical impact on charge and discharge capacity and cycle life. In this work, highresolution XRD was employed to study phase transition of o-LiMnO2 during electrochemical process and more detailed structures were refined by program Jade 6.0. Experimental o-LiMnO2 was prepared as follows: 2.0 g Mn2O3 (obtained by calcination of Mn2CO3 at 700 °C for 3 h in air) was hydrothermally treated with LiOH·H2O aqueous solution (100 ml) at molar ratio of Li/Mn=20:1 in a teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel and autoclaved at 200 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were repeatedly washed with distilled water until pH value was close to 7.0 and then dried for 0.5 h at 120 °C in air. The stainless steel model batteries Li/LiPF6 [ethylene carbonate (EC) + dimethyl carbonate (DMC)]/o-LiMnO2 were fabricated to elucidate the phase transformation of oLiMnO2 material. The o-LiMnO2 electrodes were made by casting a slurry, consisting of 85 wt.% active LiMnO2 powder, 5 wt.% acetylene black, and 10 wt.% PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) binder, on Al current collector. The electrode having 10 mg active material with a diameter of 1 cm and thickness of 0.22 mm was then pressed at 18 MPa for 1 min and vacuum-dried at 120 °C for 2 days. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box using a polypropylene (PP) microporous film as a separator, a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1:1 ratio in weight) as the electrolyte, and 99.9% metallic Li foils as counter electrodes. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged at 0.1 C rate with a voltage window of 2.0– 4.5 V at 25 °C. To investigate the structure changes of o-LiMnO2 on cycling, the model batteries were dismantled in an Ar-filled glove box, washed with dimethyl carbonate to remove LiPF6, and dried at 50 °C under vacuum for several hours. After checking the stability in air, the materials were transferred to crystal Si substrate for XRD analysis. Contrary to Al substrate, Si substrate has no peak appearing in the range of 2θ=10–140°, which ensured the accurate statistics on powder. The XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/Max 2500/PC diffractometer with CuKα radiation operating at 40 kV and 300 mA. For precise determination of the measurements, the powder diffraction patterns were recorded in the range of 2θ=10–80° or 10– 140° by step scanning, using 2θ increments of 0.04° and fixed counting time of 4 s/step. The structure refinement and quantitative analyses were performed using the program Jade 6.0. Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 1, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed based on the orthorhombic crystal system with a space group Pmnm. The calculated cell parameters of the pure oLiMnO2 are α=4.557 (3) Å, b=5.756 (2) Å, and c=2.807 (2) Å, which are well coincident with the JCPDS card (350749) [19]. Figure 2 depicts the charge and discharge potential profiles of o-LiMnO2 electrode at 0.1 C rate between 2 and 4.5 V at 25 °C. The first charge potential profile is dominated by a voltage plateau around 3.5 V, which is Fig. 1 XRD pattern of o-LiMnO2 powder Fig. 2 Charge and discharge potential profiles of the o-LiMnO2 electrode for initial three cycles 246 J Solid State Electrochem (2008) 12:245–249 completely different from that of the subsequent first discharge. Obvious discharge voltage plateaus around 4 and 3 V appear from the second cycle. This means that some irreversible reactions may occur during the initial cycles [20]. Differential capacity (dQ/dV) plots are also displayed in Fig. 3. It can be seen from the figure that two apparent redox peaks appear from the second cycle, especially in third cycle, which is in good accordance with the potential profile changes in Fig. 2. The enhancement of the incremental redox peaks is proportional to the amount of active cathode material progressively formed in the initial cycles providing the charge and discharge capacities of the Li∣o-LiMnO2 battery. To further investigate the structural evolution, the oLiMnO2 electrodes of 1-, 2-, 3-, 10-, and 20-cycled discharged to 2 V at 0.1 C rate were analyzed by XRD. As shown in Fig. 4, by the end of the first discharge process, the intensities of the peaks of LiMnO2 decrease, and in the meanwhile, some new peaks appear. After three cycles, the o-LiMnO2 could not be found from the diffraction patterns, indicating that the cathode material has completely transformed to new phases, which is consistent with the changes of the voltage plateaus (Fig. 2) and redox peaks (Fig. 3). It can be observed that the diffraction peaks of the new phases become broader than that of the pristine o-LiMnO2. This suggests that the formation of defects (e.g., microstrain and stacking faults) Fig. 4 XRD pattern evolution of the o-LiMnO2 electrodes after different cycles Fig. 3 Differential capacity (dQ/dV) vs potential curves of the oLiMnO2 electrode for initial three cycles Fig. 5 XRD pattern of spinel LiMn2O4 calculated by the cubic spinel model Fig. 6 The Rietveld refinement of the o-LiMnO2 electrode cycled for three times discharged to 2 V at 0.1 C rate. The curves are calculated XRD pattern, observed XRD pattern, and the difference between them from a to c.

After a careful comparison, one may notice that the newly appeared peak positions are very similar to those obtained from spinel LiMn2O4 in Fig. 5 [22, 23]. However, the relative strength ratio of the peaks is not completely consistent with LiMn2O4, which may indicate that another new phase exists. It is necessary to clarify the structural changes as it is closely related to the electrochemical properties. At present we have concentrated on the challenge to investigate how phases change on cycling by XRD. Rietveld refinement of the o-LiMnO2 electrode cycled for three times discharged to 2 V at 0.1 C rate was performed using the cubic spinel and rock salt structural models [23]. The phase-fitting patterns of the electrode and the refined structural parameters are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, respectively. Based on these observations it can be concluded that after three cycles, the irreversibly structure transition from o-LiMnO2 (Pmnm) to spinel LiMn2O4 (Fd3m) and rock salt Li0.5Mn0.5O (Fm 3 m) with 88.9 and 11.1 wt.%, respectively, have taken place. Up to now, it is generally accepted that the o-LiMnO2 will convert to spinel LiMn2O4 on cycling [10, 22]. Here, in more details, the LiMn2O4 structure with a cell parameter α=8.241 (1) Å has a large cationic disorder on lithium and manganese sites, i.e., about 9% of the Li positions are occupied by Mn and vice versa, which may improve its electrochemical behavior compared with that of the ordered phase [21]. On the other hand, this is the first time to report Li0.5Mn0.5O phase with space group Fm 3 m. The cell parameter of Li0.5Mn0.5O is α= 4.121 (3) Å, about half that of spinel LiMn2O4. And both Li+ and Mn3+ cations occupy the octahedral 4a sites with mole ratio 1:1. There is at least one factor that may affect the apparent inconsistency of the structural data presented in this paper. Namely, the resolution of the X-ray instrument used is not sufficient and, because of the partial peaks overlapping, the spinel structure and rock salt one could be indistinguishable. In the previous study, Chiang et al. [16] had hypothesized that the structural transformation from orthorhombic to cubic spinel occurred via an intermediate disordered rock salt structure with a space group of Fm 3 m. Different from their opinion, the rock salt structure demonstrated here is stable with the coexistence of spinel LiMn2O4 upon further cycling, as there are no obvious changes in XRD patterns of the o-LiMnO2 electrodes after 10 or 20 cycles in Fig. 4. Other researchers proposed that the transformation from o-LiMnO2 to spinel needs the migration not only of all the lithium ions but also of half of the manganese ions [24]. According to their points, we consider that, in electrochemical process, there is not enough time for the migration of all lithium and manganese ions to form spinel structure. Therefore, at the end of discharge stage, part of rock salt phase still exists. In addition, the quantity of Li0.5Mn0.5O phase formed with cycling is greatly dependent on cycling rate, as illustrated in Table 1 Structure parameters obtained from Rietveld refinement of the o-LiMnO2 electrode cycled for three times discharged to 2 V at 0.1 C rate Phase Space group Cell parameter α (Å) Atom site Atom position Occupancy Phase ratio (wt.%) x y z LiMn2O4 Fd3m 8.241 (1) Li1 8a 1/8 1/8 1/8 0.9114 88.9 Mn1 8a 1/8 1/8 1/8 0.0886 Li2 16d 1/2 1/2 1/2 0.0851 Mn2 16d 1/2 1/2 1/2 0.9149 O 32e 0.2765(4) 0.2765(1) 0.2765(5) 0.9965 Li0.5Mn0.5O Fm 3 m 4.121 (3) Li 4a 0 0 0 0.4995 11.1 Mn 4a 0 0 0 0.5005 O 4b 1/2 1/2 1/2 1.002 Fig. 7 The phase abundance of spinel LiMn2O4 (a) and rock salt Li0.5Mn0.5O (b) at different current rates 248 J Solid State Electrochem (2008) 12:245–249 Fig. 7. The higher the current density is, the larger the abundance of formed-rock salt structure is. It is probably that, applying higher current density, the faster de-/ intercalation process of lithium ions would lead to a higher local lithium concentration, thus hindering structural reordering of rock salt phase to spinel one. Conclusions The XRD results presented above show clearly that the phase transition occurred in the initial cycles. Rietveld refinement of the o-LiMnO2 electrode cycled for three times reveals the irreversible structure transition from oLiMnO2 (Pmnm) to spinel LiMn2O4 (Fd3m) and other new phase (rock salt Li0.5Mn0.5O with space group Fm 3 m). Both of them coexist upon further cycling. In addition, the quantity of Li0.5Mn0.5O phase is greatly relative to the current density. The higher the current density is, the larger the quantity of formed-rock salt structure is. Further studies aiming at investigating the electrochemical behavior of rock salt phase are currently in progress.

A variety of cation-ordering motifs have been reported for spinel oxides with multiple cations residing on the octahedral site (or B-site). This has attracted tremendous attention from both experimental and theoretical communities in the last few decades. However, no unified view has been reached, presumably due to the richness of cation species and corresponding complex arrangements emergent in this large family of compounds. In this report, local cation-ordered ground states of (inverse) spinel oxides with two different cations on the octahedral site have been thoroughly investigated using neutron and X-ray total scattering, and a comprehensive theory has been proposed to explain the commonly observed cation-ordered polymorphs. It is found that a cationzigzag-ordered structure (space group P4122) is the ground state for inverse spinel oxides with a pure or strong ionic lattice, while a cation-linear-ordered arrangement (space group Imma) emerges when one of the B-site cations forms very strong directional covalent bonds with lattice oxygen. The degree and length scale of cation ordering is strongly correlated with the charge and ionic radius difference between the two octahedral site cations. More complicated cation ordering schemes can be formed when there is a concomitant charge and orbital ordering which fall on a similar energy scale. This can lead to the formation of orbital-driven cation clusters or the broad concept of “molecules” in solidstate compounds. It is expected these findings will help to better understand the observed physical properties of spinel oxides and thus facilitate design strategies for improved functional materials. 1. INTRODUCTION Spinel oxides have attracted tremendous attention since they were first discovered about a century ago.1,2 The structural family provides a rich playground for the solid-state physicist, including but not limited to charge/orbital ordering, spin frustration, transparent conductors, multiferroics, and so on.3−7 It also attracts broad interest from the geology community due to the presence of abundant natural minerals with spinel structures.8,9 More recently, spinel oxides (e.g., trimetallic spinel oxides) have been broadly investigated as promising electrode materials for energy storage or as high-efficiency catalysts for photo or thermal catalytic reactions.10−15 It has been well-recognized that the physical properties of spinel oxides are strongly correlated with corresponding cation ordering schemes. For example, the resistivity to radiation induced amorphization of MgM(III)2O4 (M = Al, Ga, or In) has an opposite correlation with the degree of cation disordering.16 The C-rate (charge/discharge of a battery in a specific time) performance of spinel cathodes LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is strongly correlated with the degree of nanoscale ordering of Ni and Mn.17 While cation-ordered LiCrTiO4 and LiCoMnO4 can work as promising anode and cathode materials for Li-ion batteries, the partially disordered LiMnTiO4 and LiCoTiO4 only show very limited reversible charge/discharge capacity.18−21 More recently, it was discovered that cation short-range order can strongly affect the Li transport in longrange disordered rock salt or spinel-type metal oxides.22 Moreover, inverse spinel LiNiVO4 and LiCoVO4 possess very high Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox potentials but only show very limited reversible charge/discharge capacities.23,24 In order to better understand the relationship between the cation arrangements and physical properties of spinel oxides, it is necessary to capture the detailed cation-ordering/-disordering schemes. Conventionally, the spinel oxides are written as (A1−λBλ)[AλB2−λ]O4, where the cations in the round parentheses reside on the tetrahedral site (Wyckoff8b (or 8a) site in space group Fd3̅m) while the cations in the square parentheses reside on the octahedral site (Wyckoff16c (or 16d) site in space group Received: June 6, 2019 Published: October 18, 2019 Article pubs.acs.org/IC Cite This: Inorg.

Fd3̅m), and λ represents the degree of inversion.25 The compound is called normal spinel when λ is equal to zero, and it is called inverse spinel when λ is equal to one, mixed spinel is used to describe compounds with 0< λ < 1.25,26 While the definition about normal and inverse is straightforward for bimetallic spinel oxides, great ambiguities exist in the literature for compounds with three or more cations. For example, compounds such as (Li)[CrTi]O4, (Li)[CrMn]O4, and (Li)[CoMn]O4 are often referred to as normal spinel, while (V)[LiNi]O4, (V)[LiCo]O4 and (Zn)[LiNb]O4 are regularly termed inverse spinel. To the best of our knowledge,18,19,23,27−29 this ambiguity is very likely to be rooted in the differences observed in corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns: The former series of compounds show very strong (111) reflection but with negligible intensity for the (220) reflection, similar to that of normal spinel oxides such as MgCr2O4.30 In contrast, the latter compounds show much stronger (220) reflection at the expense of the (111) reflection. Though this classification (using the relative intensities of a few Bragg reflections in XRD patterns) has been widely used in some communities, it is not conclusive.31,32 For example, the (111) peak is very weak while (220) peak is very strong for the normal spinel (Co)[Al]2O4.33 Specifically, the relationship between the scattering intensity (of specific hkl reflection) and atomic scattering factors (lengths) of spinel oxides in space group Fd3̅m is shown in eq S1. It can be seen that the (111) peak will be very strong if the cations in the tetrahedral (8b) site have much smaller scattering factor (e.g., X-ray atomic scattering factor for Li) relative to those of the cations on the octahedral (16c) site (e.g., X-ray atomic scattering factors for transition metal cations). Interestingly, if neutron diffraction data are collected, then the relative intensities of (111) peak would be quite similar for both series of compounds (Figure S1) because of the drastically different nuclear scattering lengths relative to the X-ray atomic scattering factors (for both cations and oxygen ions). Therefore, the classification about normal and inverse according to a few Bragg diffraction peaks is not conclusive. We propose that all trimetallic (A)[BC]O4-type (B ≠C) spinel oxides be called inverse spinel to emphasize that two different cations occupy the octahedral site in a 1:1 ratio, similar to the traditional definition of the bimetallic inverse spinel oxides with general formula of (B)[AB]O4. For the trimetallic inverse spinel oxides, the degree of inversion (1-λ) can be defined as A1−λByCλ−y[AλB1−yC1−λ+y]O4 (λ −y ≥0, y < 1). In the inverse spinel oxides, cations are well ordered (inversion = 1) between the octahedral (B) and tetrahedral (A) sites at relatively low temperatures.25,34,35 However, the cation-ordering/-disordering schemes within the octahedral site are not well understood.36 Recently, Stevanovic et al. proposed a simple point-ion electrostatic (PIE) model to explore the ground state of spinel oxides.34 On the basis of this model, they predict the cation ordering on the octahedral site with tetragonal distortion (space group P4122 or P4322) to be the universal ground state for inverse spinel oxides. Though this prediction is in good agreement with the experimental observation of various inverse spinel oxides such as (Zn)[ZnTi]O4 and (Li)[LiTe]O4,27 it is worth noting that it assumes that all inverse spinel oxides have a purely ionic lattice with negligible electronic/covalent contribution. The validity of this theory is therefore questionable for compounds with strong covalent bonded cations on the octahedral site, especially those with strong Jahn−Teller distortions, such as Cu2+ (d9).37,38 Moreover, it cannot explain why (Zn)[ZnTi]O4 can be synthesized in long-range Zn-Ti ordered form (P4122), while only a long-range cation disordered phase (Fd3̅m) has been reported for (Zn)[ZnSn]O4, though Ti and Sn have apparently the same valence state of 4+.15,39,40 More recently, by using the group theory analysis of the Landau phase transition theory, Talanov et al. identified the two possible ordered phases (i.e., the orthorhombic Imma and tetragonal P4122, for inverse spinel compounds (AB2X4)).41 The former space group has been observed for inverse spinel (V)[LiCu]O4 42,43 and was long believed to be the low temperature phase for magnetite (Fe3+[Fe2+Fe3+]O4) above its Verwey transition, though this assignment is still under fierce debate and the charge ordering pattern has been found to be much more complicated than originally reported.44,45 In contrast to theoretical prediction, the majority of inverse spinel oxides are reported to crystallize in the cation disordered form (space group Fd3̅m);25 this discrepancy between the observed longrange structure and theoretical prediction inspires us to investigate the local and average cation arrangement schemes in inverse spinel oxides with a variety of different B-site cations (different valence states, ionic radii and electronic configurations), which may help us to better understand the basic rules governing cation ordering/disordering. This in return may help us to better understand the observed physical properties and facilitate design strategies for improved functional spinel oxides. 2. EXPERIMENT SECTION 2.1. Materials Synthesis. 2.1.1. LiNiVO4 and LiCoVO4. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%), NiO (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%), and V2O5 (Alfa Aesar, 99.2%) were handground in a mortar and pestle for about 45 min. The powder was then transferred to an alumina crucible. The mixture was heated to 800 °C in a MTI box furnace at a ramp rate of 250 °C/h. The sample was annealed at this temperature for 20 h and then cooled down to room temperature using the furnace cooling rate (200−250 °C/h). This annealing process was repeated once more with an intermediate grinding step. The final product was a dark yellow powder. LiCoVO4 was synthesized under similar conditions with NiO replaced by CoO (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) and annealing temperature lowered to 700 °C. The final LiCoVO4 is a maroon colored powder. 7Li2CO3 (inhouse synthesized from 7LiCl) was used to synthesize the isotope containing 7LiNiVO4 and 7LiCoVO4 for neutron diffraction measurement. 2.1.2. Zn2TiO4. Stoichiometric amounts of ZnO (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) and TiO2 (anatase, Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%) were mixed and hand-ground for about 45 min, the mixture was annealed at 1100 °C for 20 h and cooled down to room temperature at the furnace cooling rate. This process was repeated three times with two intermediate grinding steps. The final white powder was found to be phase pure Zn2TiO4. Two methods were used to synthesize Zn2SnO4: For the solid state synthesis, zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O) (Alfa Aesar, >98%) was mixed with SnO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) and hand-ground for about 45 min, and the mixture was then annealed at 400 °C for 10 h. The product was reground and further heated to 1100 °C for 20 h; the final white powder was found to be Zn2SnO4 with about 1−2% residual SnO2. For the coprecipitate method, ZnCl2· 2H2O (Sigma Aldrich, >98%) and SnCl4·5H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) were dissolved in 100 mL of mili-Q water by adding 0.01 mol of HCl. Next, 0.01 M NaOH was added to the solution dropwise until the pH reached 8. The white precipitant was dried at 150 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The dried gel was then ground for 45 min and fired at 1100 °C for 20h. The final product was found to be pure Zn2SnO4. To synthesize the cation-ordered forms of Zn2TiO4 and Zn2SnO4, the Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14390 high-temperature annealed products were further heated at 500 °C for 7 days in air before slowly cooling down to room temperature at 2 °C/min. While Zn2TiO4 can be synthesized in a long-range cationordered polymorph, no long-range cation-ordered phase was observed for Zn2SnO4. 2.1.3. NiAl2O4. Stoichiometric amounts of NiO (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) and Al2O3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) were mixed and handground. The mixture was first annealed at 1100 °C for 20 h. The product was then reground and further calcined at the same temperature for another 20 h in a MTI box furnace. 2.1.4. MgIn2O4. Stoichiometric amounts of Mg(Ac)2·4H2O (Sigma Aldrich, >99%) and In2O3(Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) were mixed and hand-ground for about 45 min. The mixture was first calcined at 400 °C for 10 h. The product was reground and then annealed at 1100 °C for 20 h. The final white powder was found to be phase pure MgIn2O4. 2.1.5. LiCrTiO4. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3(Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%), Cr2O3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%), and TiO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%) were mixed and hand-ground for about 45 min. The mixed powder was then heated to 850 °C for 20h. The final product was found to be a dark yellow powder. 7Li2CO3 was used to synthesize 7LiCrTiO4 for neutron diffraction measurement. 2.1.6. LiMn2O4. Stoichiometric amounts of 7Li2CO3 and MnO2 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%) were mixed and hand-ground for about 45 min. The mixture was then annealed at 800 °C for 20 h. The product was then reground and further annealed at the same temperature for another 20 h. 2.1.7. LiZnNbO4. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%), Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (Alfa Aesar, >98%), and Nb2O5 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) were mixed and hand-ground for about 45 min. The mixture was first calcined at 400 °C for 10 h. The product was then reground and further annealed at 1100 °C for 20 h. One intermediate grinding step with another 20 h of annealing was required to obtain the phase pure LiZnNbO4. 2.2. X-ray Diffraction. Powder diffraction patterns were collected on a PANalytical X’Pert MPD Pro X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54187 Å) equipped with an Anton Paar XRK90 linear detector. The diffraction experiments were carried out with a step size of 0.016711° and at a scan rate of 100 s/step in Bragg− Brentano configuration. The primary and secondary radius were set to 240 mm. Room-temperature synchrotron X-ray total scattering data were collected on beamline 11-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. The rapid-acquisition pair distribution function (RaPDF) method was used with an X-ray energy of 58.6 KeV (λ = 0.2114 Å).46 A Perkin−Elmer amorphous Si twodimensional image-plate detector (2048 × 2048 pixels and 200 × 200 mm pixel size) was used for two-dimensional data collection with a sample-to-detector distance of ∼180 mm. The two-dimensional data were converted to one-dimensional diffraction data using the Fit2D software.47 PDF data were obtained from Fourier transformation of the background and Compton scattering corrected data (S(Q)) in PDFgetX2 with the Q range of 0.1−26 Å−1. The instrument parameters Qbroad and Qdamp were determined to be 0.025 and 0.027 Å−1 (1−50 Å) using the NIST standard Ni.48 2.3. Neutron Diffraction. 2.3.1. NOMAD. Neutron total scattering data of samples were collected at the NOMAD beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.49 For the current experiment, about 1 g of powder sample was loaded into a 6 mm vanadium can. Two 30 min scans were collected for each powder sample and then summed together to improve statistics. The detectors were calibrated using scattering from a diamond powder standard prior to the measurements. Neutron powder diffraction data were normalized against a vanadium rod, the background was subtracted, and the total scattering structure factor S(Q) data were transformed to pair distribution function data G(r) using the specific IDL codes developed for the NOMAD instrument with the Q range of 0.2 to 31.4 Å−1. The instrument parameters Qbroad and Qdamp were determined to be 0.026 and 0.018 Å−1 (1−50 Å) using the NIST standard Si 640e. 2.3.2. POWGEN. About 2 g of powder samples was loaded into 8 mm vanadium cans. Three 1 h scans were collected for each powder pattern. The collected diffraction data was normalized against a vanadium rod and calibrated using a diamond standard. The updated POWGEN beamline enables the collection of neutron powder diffraction data through a very large Q range in a single bank configuration. A Q range of 0.8−30 Å−1 was used for the Fourier transfer. The instrument parameters Qbroad and Qdamp were determined to be 0.012 and 0.011 Å−1 (1−50 Å) using the NIST standard Si 640e.50 2.3.3. DFT Calculation. All DFT calculations are performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)51 adopting the projector augmented-wave (PAW) approach to describe the atomic potential, which means except for valence electrons in outmost s, p, and d orbitals all the other inner shell electrons are treated as part of the atomic core.52 The exchange-correlation functional is taken in the form of the parametrization of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).53 To address the strong electron correlation existing in transition metal oxides materials as the situation with inverse spinel materials we studied here, spin polarized Hubbard type Hamiltonian is adopted with effective corrective U value added to the d orbital of transition metals: 4.0 eV for Ni, 2.0 eV for V, 3.5 eV for Cr, 4.5 eV for Ti, 3.5 eV for Sn, and 7.5 eV for Zn. Hubbard U-type correction is adopted with effective U value of 4.0 eV for Ni and 2.0 eV for V.54,55 For all calculations, the energy cutoffs of plane wave basis for wave function and charge density are 500 and 756 eV, respectively. A gammacentered type k-mesh with the density of one point per ∼0.05Å−3 is generated to ensure the precision of the calculated total energy. For the relaxations model structures, the forces felt by each of the atoms are well-converged below 0.005 eV·Å−1. To simulate the inverse spinel structure with cations randomly distributed within the octahedral sites, the special quasi-random structures (SQSs) were constructed through the ATAT code.56,57 The supercell for disordered LiNiVO4 is built from the rhombohedral unit cell through the transformation matrix [−1, 1, −2; 2, −2, 1; −2, −1, 2] with 126 atoms inside the supercell. For the initial magnetic moment, configuration of each material ferromagnetic ordering is assumed since in an ambient environment all materials show paramagnetism which indicates small energy differences between different magnetic ordering. 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Surveying the literature, we noticed that if the charge difference between the two octahedral cations (B and C) is larger than 3 in inverse spinel oxides then complete ordering is observed, such as in (Zn)[Li+Nb5+]O4 and (Li)[Li+Te6+]O4.27,58 Unfortunately, no complete inversion has been achieved for octahedral cations with a charge difference of 3. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether it (with charge difference of 3) will be long-range ordered or disordered. If the charge difference between the two cations is equal to 2, then both ordered and disordered phases have been observed. For example, both cation-disordered (space group Fd3̅m) and -ordered (space group P4122) polymorphs of (Zn)[ZnTi]O4 have been reported. It was also shown that the degree of cation ordering can be substantially increased by annealing these oxides at relatively low temperature (e.g., 400 to 500 °C) for very long times (hundreds of hours), indicating that the cation ordering in these compounds is likely controlled by thermodynamics rather than kinetics. Only the room-temperature long-range cation-disordered form has been observed if the charge difference is equal to 1, apart from LiCuVO4 and Al(Ga)V2O4 (this exception will be addressed in the last section of this report). For instance, V[Li+Co2+]O4, V[Li+Ni2+]O4, Li[Cr3+Ti4+]O4, and Li[Mn3+Mn4+]O4 have all been reported to crystallize in space group Fd3̅m.23,28,29,59 It is thus obvious that the electrostatic repulsion between the Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14391 octahedral cations (B and C) plays a predominant role in determining the degree of cation ordering. Thus, we will categorize the series of inverse spinel oxides based on the charge difference (ZB −ZC) between the octahedral cations. 3.1. ZB = 1 and ZC = 2 (LiM(II)VO4, (A)[BC]O4 Inverse Spinel). For this case, the tetrahedral cation (A) should have the valence state of 5+. It is known that cations with large ionic radii such as Nb5+, Ta5+, Sb5+, or Bi5+ have strong preference for high coordination environments in oxides, though a few tetrahedrally coordinated Nb5+ have been reported (e.g., fergusonite).60 In contrast, if A5+ cations form very strong A−O covalent bonds, it is very likely it will significantly distort the close-packed oxygen arrays. This distortion drives B1+C2+A5+O4 to adopt the olivine-type structure, such as that in phosphates (LiFePO4) and arsenates (LiCoAsO4), and so on.61,62 Thus, vanadate-based B1+C2+V5+O4 compounds are so far the only candidates for this category. There are a variety of structure types for these vanadates, such as the NaCaVO4-type (space group Cmcm),63 the LiZnVO4-type (space group R3̅)64 and the inverse spinel type (space group Fd3̅m). The detailed differences among these structure types falls outside of the scope of the current research, and we shall confine discussion in this report to the structure of the inverse spinel oxides. Two long-range structures have been reported for the vanadatebased inverse spinel oxides. LiCuVO4 has been reported to possess the orthorhombic Imma structure with Li+ and Cu2+ ordered in perpendicular linear chains. In contrast, LiNiVO4 and LiCoVO4 have universally been reported to crystallize in space group Fd3̅m with the tetrahedral site fully occupied by V5+ and Li/Ni or Li/Co randomly distributed on the octahedral site.23 However, it is noteworthy that this Li/Ni or Li/Co random distribution model contradicts particular observed physical properties: first, if Li and transition metal ions are randomly distributed on the octahedral site, it is expected that the Li-ion diffusion pathway is fully blocked by transition metal ions (Ni and V) and thus very limited Li+ extraction is expected. However, appreciable amounts of Li+ can be chemically or electrochemically extracted from both compounds.23 Second, it is expected that both compounds will run into spin glass or paramagnetic states at low temperatures if nonmagnetic Li+ and magnetic Ni2+ are randomly distributed on the octahedral sites.65 However, antiferromagnetic character has been observed for both compounds at low temperatures.66 These controversies suggest that the Li and transition metal ions are not randomly distributed on the octahedral site, at least at short range. Moreover, it is unclear why LiCuVO4 crystallizes in the cation-ordered orthorhombic structure while LiNiVO4 and LiCoVO4 prefer the long-range cationdisordered structure. This motivates us to explore the shortrange cation arrangements in the long-believed cation disordered LiNiVO4 and LiCoVO4. It is found that the cation random distributed model (space group Fd3̅m) can fit well both neutron and X-ray Bragg diffraction data for LiNiVO4, as can be seen in Figures 1 and S1. However, if caution is paid to the difference curve (Figure 2), nonrandom diffuse scattering signal can be clearly observed. This nonrandom signal is further confirmed by the similarity between refinement difference curves for data collected at different instruments (neutron diffraction data from POWGEN and NOMAD in the current case). Thus, it clearly indicates the presence of some type of short-range ordering in the compound. Though the reciprocal space diffraction data gives clear evidence of the existence of shortrange order, it is difficult to carry out quantitative analysis due to the very broad nature of these diffuse scattering features. The pair distribution function (PDF) utilizes both Bragg and diffuse scattering data across a wide range of Q (momentum transfer, equal to 2π/d) and amplifies the weak diffuse scattering signal by evaluating it in real space via sine Fourier transformation. Thus, it has been proven to be a powerful technique to quantitatively study chemical short-range order (SRO), local distortion, and complex nanostructure.17,67−70 Indeed, we found the Li/Ni random distribution model (Fd3̅m) fits poorly for PDF data below 8 Å (Figure 3), especially for the first few G(r) peaks, indicating the presence of chemical short-range order or local distortion. However, the cation random distribution model fit reasonably well for both X-ray and neutron PDF data above 8 Å (Figure S2), indicating that the cation ordering/local distortion region is very likely to be limited to a small length scale. This is consistent with the very broad diffuse scattering signal in neutron diffraction data (Figures 2 and S3). Figure 1.

Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14392 To further explore the possible cation ordering and local distortion schemes, we refined the two possible cation ordering models proposed by Talanov et al.41 (i.e., the tetragonal P4122 (or P4322) and the orthorhombic Imma), using local PDF data. For the tetragonal ordering model, the two octahedral cations (Li+ and Ni2+) order alternatively along the diagonal direction in ab (ac and bc) plane, resulting in zigzag edgesharing octahedral chains along the tetragonal c-axis direction, which is also the 41 or 43 screw-axis direction, as can be seen in Figure 3a. For the orthorhombic ordering model, the two cations are ordered in two perpendicular directions, with one octahedral chain running through the [110]cubic(cubic indicate the cubic parent phase) direction, while the other octahedral chain along the [11̅0]cubic direction, as can be seen in Figures 3. It is found that the Li/Ni tetragonal ordered model can substantially improve the fit of both local X-ray and neutron PDF (Figure 4). The refined result shows a very limited local tetragonal distortion with an a/c ratio (relative to pseudocubic configuration) of 1.01, indicating it is the short-range cation ordering instead of local distortion that dominates the local structure discrepancy. In addition, the two cations are not fully ordered on the octahedral site, about 25% site mixing has been found for the refined local structure (up to 8 Å), indicating there are locally other types of ordering schemes present (e.g., Imma). Moreover, the broad diffuse scattering signal in neutron diffraction data can also be well-modeled using this partially ordered tetragonal model with the short-range refinement extended to the second metal−metal shell (Figure S3). This result suggests the electrostatic repulsive force between Li+ and Ni2+ is relatively weak and it may be difficult to synthesize a long-range ordered phase. However, it is worth noting that it might be possible to increase the local to intermediate range cation ordering by annealing the sample at lower temperature for very long time, or by synthesizing the sample via low-temperature soft synthetic methods. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of Greenbaum et al. By analyzing the 58V and 7Li solid-state NMR data, they found Li+ and Ni2+ arranges differently for samples obtained from the high-temperature solid state synthesis verses those produced from a low-temperature sol−gel route.71 In contrast, the orthorhombic-ordered model Imma only increases the fit quality slightly despite the same amount of refinable structural parameters used relative to the tetragonal model (Figure 4), indicating that perpendicular ordered cation linear chains (Figure 3) are absent or very limited in LiNiVO4. Taken together, a comprehensive theory is required to further understand the mechanism governing the octahedralsite cation ordering in inverse spinel oxides. For an ionic lattice, the cohesive energy is predominately determined by electrostatic energy and Born repulsive energy, as can be seen in eq S2.72 Assuming that different types of cation distributions on octahedral sites (of inverse spinel oxides) will not significantly distort the cubic lattice, then the contribution from electrostatic attractive (cation−anion) energy, electrostatic repulsive energy for tetrahedral cations (tetrahedral cation−cation) and the short-range Born repulsive energy shall be the same for all different polymorphs. Thus, the major cohesive energy difference (among polymorphs with different cation distribution) is solely determined by the electrostatic repulsive energy between the two octahedral cations (with different valence states), as can be seen in eq S3. Recently, Stevanovic et al. carried out the summation of eq S3 using the Edward method73 and found zigzag ordered octahedral cations in space group P4122 to be the universal electrostatic ground state. Though their calculation is sound, the physical interpretation of the result in the original paper is not fully correct. Figure 3. Connection of the octahedral-site cations (Li+ and M2+) in the P4122 (a) and Imma (b) ordered LiMVO4. The structures of P4122 (c) and Imma (d) ordered LiMVO4 are shown with cation polyhedra. The connection of octahedral-site cations in the P4122 is shown along the c-axis direction to emphasize the 41 screw axis.

Three different local structure models are used: the cation-disordered cubic Fd3̅m, orthorhombic-ordered Imma and tetragonal-ordered P4122. The calculated and measured reduced pair distribution functions G(r) are shifted for easy comparison. Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14393 In the spinel structure, each octahedral site is coordinated by six other octahedral sites in the nearest shell, forming a triangle antiprism, as can be seen in Figures 3 and 5. Since there are two cations (B and C) on the octahedral sites with different valence states, it is electrostatically more stable to have more B−C pairs than B−B and C−C pairs. There are two ways to construct the nearest cation shell with the lowest electrostatic repulsion, one with the B (or C) cations linearly placed on the edge of the antiprism and the other with the zigzag-ordered B (or C) cations, as can be seen in Figure 5. Both configurations give eight B−C, two B−B, and two C−C pairs. If the linearordered cations are extended with large periodicity, then the long-range structure is Imma. If the zigzag type cation arrangement is extended, then the ordered structure shall be tetragonal P4122. Thus, Imma and P4122 ordered polymorphs possess the same electrostatic energy if only the first cation shell is counted. However, since the electrostatic repulsive energy decreases slowly as a function of 1/r, the contribution from higher order cation shells is not negligible.74 Indeed, we found the electrostatic repulsive energy difference is rooted in the higher order cation shells, as can be seen in Figure S4. It is worth noting that summing of the electrostatic energy difference (ΔE = EImma −EP4122) by sphere expansion (the most straightforward and widely used method)75,76 does not converge up to at least the 20th cation−cation shell. The difference can be correctly evaluated by either using the Ewald method73 or by summing expanded cubes (or the so-called Evjen method).77 By using the latter method with a cell dimension of 2 × 2 × 2, the calculated electrostatic energy difference ΔE is found to be proportional to 0.79 × (ZB − ZC)2/RBC, where RBC represents the nearest distance between cation B and C (assuming they have essentially the same ionic radii). It is worth noting that this approximation is only valid for cases when the ionic radii difference between B and C is relatively small. In contrast, RBC is likely to diverge into drastically different nearest RBB, RCC, and RBC terms with large ionic radii difference (the cation distances are more complicated for higher order cation shells). This shall lead to the increase of ΔE (relative to that of cations with similar ionic radii) by reducing the effective RBC. Accordingly, the tetragonal-ordered P4122 polymorph is expected to have lower electrostatic energy relative to that of the Imma ordered polymorph if considering a purely ionic lattice model. The energy difference (between these two polymorphs) increases drastically as the charge difference increases since ΔE ∝(ZB −ZC)2, this explains why no inverse spinel oxide has been reported to possess room temperature Imma structure with ZB −ZC larger than two. This also suggests that the degree and length scale of zigzag-ordered Bsite cations is likely to increase with the increase of ionic radii difference between cations B and C. It is expected that the P4122 type ordering is the universal ground state with a purely ionic lattice. However, it may be a different scenario when the covalent bond weighs in. This effect becomes indispensable (or sometimes even dominant) for spinel oxides containing transition metal (TM) cations. Since O2−has three mutually full-filled 2p orbitals, they may hybridize with the empty or half-filled TM cation orbitals (nd, (n + 1)s, or (n + 1)p) if the energy difference is not too large. In the spinel oxides, one oxygen is connected to three octahedral cations and one tetrahedral cation, as can be seen in Figure S6. Thus, it may form covalent bonds with both types of cations. TM cations with empty (e.g., Cr6+ and V5+), full-filled (e.g., Zn2+ and Cd2+), or half-filled (Mn2+ and Fe3+) d orbitals have been reported to form moderate to strong tetrahedral covalent bonds with oxygen 2p orbitals through sp3 type hybridization (Figure S7). Thus, if these cations (with shallow d orbitals) occupy the tetrahedral sites, moderate to strong tetrahedral covalent bonds are expected.78 However, there are two different types of covalent bonds for the octahedral cations (e.g., the distorted octahedral covalent bonds and the regular octahedral-type covalent bonds).78 The former is often found for octahedral cations with strong Jahn−Teller (JT) distortions (only JT associated with eg orbitals are considered here for simplicity; the situation for t2g JT is more complicated and will be addressed in the last section of the paper), such as Ni3+ (low-spin d7) or Cu2+ (d9), that can form very strong distorted covalent bonds with oxygen (near square plaquettes). The latter regular type is often found for transition metal cations with degenerated eg orbitals, such as Cr3+ (d3), Mn4+ (d3), and Co3+ (low spin d6), that can form σ bonds with oxygen 2p orbitals via d2−sp3 hybridization. It was found that the distortion type covalent bonds (forming square planar bonds in extreme case) are highly directional and are often accompanied by very strong orbital ordering of the eg orbitals, as evidenced by the linear edge-sharing CuO2 or NiO2 square plaquette chains in many cuprates and nickelates.79,80 In contrast, the octahedral-type covalent bonds are more isotropic and less distortional. Thus, it is often difficult to distinguish this type of covalent bond from a purely ionic bond by structure analysis alone,78,81 and it is also less likely to alter the cation-ordering preference for the spinel lattice from the pure ionic model. If both octahedral and tetrahedral cations can form strong covalent bonds (with lattice oxygen), then there shall be a competition between these two types of bonds due to steric constraint (i.e., the octahedral cation-oxygentetrahedral cation bond angle is much larger than 90° in spinel oxides, Figure S6). Thus, strong covalent bonding is likely to form for only one type of cation (either tetrahedral or octahedral but not both). Taken together, there are three major factors governing the cation ordering in inverse spinel oxides (A)[BC]O4 (ZB ≠ZC): (1) electrostatic repulsion, mainly between the two cations (B and C) on octahedral sites with different valence states, (2) covalent bonding between the octahedral cation and oxygen, and (3) competition between the respective covalent bonding of tetrahedral and octahedral cations due to steric constraint. Figure 5. Antiprism connection of octahedral cations with the lowest electrostatic repulsion energy for the first cation shell in LiM (II)VO4. The left panel shows the local P4122-type ordering, and the right panel displays the local Imma-type ordering. Li is shown as a green ball, and metal M is shown as a blue ball. Higher order cation shells are shown in Figure S4. Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14394 Factor (1) tends to drive the cations to order in the zigzag manner (space group P4122) with the lowest electrostatic energy. There are two different scenarios for (2): If the covalent bond is isotropic octahedral-type, then it is unlikely to alter the cation ordering preference (i.e., the cation ordering is still driven by the electrostatic repulsion between octahedral cations). In contrast, if there is very strong planar square-type covalent bond, then it is very likely that octahedral cations will be ordered in the linear chain manner (e.g., space group Imma). (4) If the charge ordering (due to electrostatic repulsion) and the covalent bonding/orbital ordering compete and fall within a similar energy scale, it is very likely to result in more complex local cation ordering patterns. Finally, if a strong covalent bond is formed between the tetrahedral cation and oxygen, then the O−A−O angle (ideal value of 109.6°) will be very rigid. However, the linear chain type cation ordering (e.g., space group Imma) requires a relatively large distortion of the close packed oxygen arrays. This distortion drives the O−A−O angle away from the ideal tetrahedral angle and weakens the orbital overlap. Thus, the competition between (3) and (2) hinders the linear chain type cation ordering. With the above theory, we can now explain the cation ordering difference between LiNiVO4 and LiCuVO4. Since Ni2+ (d8) has two unpaired eg electrons, it is necessary that the degeneracy of the eg orbitals is lifted and the spin of one of the unpaired electrons is flipped to form square planar bonds, as can be seen in Figure 6. However, the crystal field splitting (of eg) caused by O2−(ΔO) is weaker relative to the electron pairing energy for Ni 3d, as evidenced by the regular octahedral coordination of Ni2+ in NiO. Therefore, planar square covalent bonds do not form between Ni2+ and O2−, and the bonding between Ni and O is highly ionic. The reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between Ni2+ and Li+ is thus the dominant driving force for cation ordering. Thus, Li+ and Ni2+ would prefer the zigzag-type ordering with the tetragonal distorted lattice (space group P4122). In contrast, the strong JT tendency of Cu2+ leads to collective eg orbital ordering and the formation of very strong square planar covalent bonds in LiCuVO4 (with the short Cu−O bond length of 1.95 Å and longer Cu−O distance of 2.43 Å), and these covalent bonds are likely to be much stronger than the tetrahedral covalent bonds for V5+ (d0).78 In addition, the electrostatic repulsive force is relatively weak because of the small charge difference between Li+ and Cu2+. Thus, the planar square covalent bond dominates and drives the cations to order in perpendicular linear chains, resulting in the observed orthorhombic longrange ordered phase (space group Imma). To attain quantitative insight, DFT calculations in the GGA +U framework are conducted for LiNiVO4 to validate the above refinement result and theoretical assumption. The lattice parameters obtained by DFT calculation and PDF refinement are compared in Table S1. It can be seen that the differences are well below 2%, implying very good agreement between DFT calculation and experimental measurements. The calculated total energy per formula unit (f.u.) of three different phases are listed in Table 1. The tetragonal ordered structure in space group P4122 has the lowest total energy, indicating that LiNiVO4 tends to crystallize in this phase and the cation ordering is likely to be controlled by thermodynamics. It is also worth noting that the energy difference between the Imma phase and the P4122 phase is rather small, suggesting that cation-ordered Imma domains may also exist in the synthesized material. This is in good agreement with the above theory and the corresponding experiment results (Figure 4) and Tables S4 and S5. For LiCoVO4, if Co2+(d7) is in its high spin state (S = 3/2), then the bonding between Co2+ and O2−is highly ionic and LiCoVO4 is likely to possess the zigzag cation-ordered ground state (space group P4122). In contrast, if it is in its low spin state (S = 1/2), then there are strong Jahn−Teller distorted and axial distorted octahedral covalent bonds between Co2+ and O2−, similar to that of the LiCuVO4. Therefore, it is likely to possess ordered cation linear chains with space group Imma. According to the local structure refinement (Figure S8 and Table S8), we found LiCoVO4 has similar short-range structure to that of LiNiVO4, with Li+ and Co2+ locally ordered in the zigzag manner (space group P4122). This indicates that Co2+ is in its high spin state, which is indeed consistent with the magnetic susceptibility result from Pico et al.66 Moreover, since Li+ and Co2+ have very similar ionic radii (0.760 and 0.745 Å),82 it is expected that the degree of cation ordering is lower in the LiCoVO4 relative to that in the LiNiVO4. This is in good agreement with refined degree of cation ordering ratio of 0.67(2) (Table S8). 3.2. ZB = 2 and ZC = 3 (NiAl2O4 and MgIn2O4, (B)[AB]O4 Inverse Spinel). NiAl2O4 and MgIn2O4 inverse spinels have been reported to possess the cation-disordered long-range structure.6,83 This is also consistent with the average structures refined from either powder neutron or Xray diffraction data, as can be seen in Figures S10 and S11. According to the above theory, NiAl2O4 is predicted to possess the tetragonal ordered ground state (P4122) due to the highly ionic lattice. It is also expected that the degree of Ni2+/Al3+ local ordering is higher than those (of Li+/Ni2+ or Li+/Co2+) in the LiNiVO4 and LiCoVO4 because of the much larger ionic radii difference between Ni2+ (0.690 Å) and Al3+ (0.535 Å). This is indeed consistent with the refined local structure using neutron PDF data (1−8 Å, Figure 7 and Table S10), where Ni2+/Al3+ are found to be nearly fully ordered (1.00(2)) within the length scale of one-unit cell.

Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14395 For MgIn2O4, although In3+ has full-filled 3d orbitals, it has been previously proposed to be able to excite one of the 3d electrons into the upper 4s/4p orbital and the electronic configuration can be written as 3d94s4p1.78 It is therefore possible to form strong square planar covalent bonds with the oxygen 2p orbitals (not as strong as the Cu2+ due to the coulomb repulsion from the single electron on one of the 4p orbitals). Thus, there will be a competition between the electrostatic repulsion and the square covalent bond (orbital ordering of the singlet eg orbital). However, according to the local structure refinement using X-ray PDF (Figure 8 and Table S12, 1−9 Å), the zigzag ordered Mg2+/In3+ (space group P4122) provides a better fit relative to the orthorhombic linear chain ordering scheme, especially for the metal−metal pair located around 3.2 Å, indicating that electrostatic repulsion dominates and drives the cations to order in the former manner. It is also worth noting that the degree of local Mg2+/ In3+ ordering is refined to be 0.78(2), much lower than the degree of local Ni2+/Al3+ ordering in NiAl2O4. This can be ascribed to the much smaller ionic radii difference between Mg2+ (0.720 Å) and In3+ (0.800 Å).82 This result further confirms that ionic radii difference (ΔR) plays an indispensable role in determining the degree of local octahedral cation ordering in inverse spinel oxides. 3.3. ZB = 3 and ZC = 4 (LiCrTiO4, (A)[BC]O4 Inverse Spinel). LiCrTiO4 has been reported to crystallize in the cation-disordered long-range structure (space group Fd3̅m). The structure has been confirmed by Rietveld refinement using neutron diffraction data collected from both POWGEN (Figure S1) and NOMAD (Figures S12 and S13 and Table S13). According to the above theory, the weak covalent bond between Cr3+(d3) and oxygen is the octahedral type (with d2− sp3 hybridization). Thus, it is expected that the Cr3+ and Ti4+ in LiCrTiO4 will possess the zigzag cation-ordered (space group P4122) local structure. This is indeed consistent with the experimental observation, as can be seen in Figure 9. In addition, Cr3+ and Ti4+ has very similar ionic radii (0.615 Å and 0.605 Å)82 and therefore the degree of local Cr3+/Ti4+ ordering is very likely to be much lower than those in NiAl2O4 and MgIn2O4. This is in good agreement with the refined degree of cation ordering of 0.68(1) (Table S14). 3.4. ZB = 2 and ZC = 4 (Zn2TiO4 and Zn2SnO4, (B)[AB]O4 Inverse Spinel). Both Ti-O and Sn-O bonds are strongly ionic; therefore, cation zigzag ordering is predicted to be the ground state for both Zn2TiO4 and Zn2SnO4. Interestingly, both long-range cation-ordered (P4122) and disordered forms (Fd3̅m) of Zn2TiO4 have been reported in the literature,27,39 while Zn2SnO4 has only been reported to crystallize in the long-range cation disordered phase.84 This indicates the driving force for cation ordering is stronger in Zn2TiO4 relative to Zn2SnO4. This is likely to be rooted in the much larger ionic radii difference between the octahedral coordinated Zn2+(0.740 Å) and Ti4+(0.605 Å) (relative to that of Sn4+ of 0.690 Å). This also brings up the question of whether Zn2+ and Sn4+ are short-range ordered or disordered and what their ordering length scale is. For more consistent comparison, we carried out local structure study for both longrange disordered Zn2TiO4 and Zn2SnO4. The refinement of the short-range structure clearly indicates that Zn2+ and Sn4+ are fully ordered in the zigzag manner in Zn2SnO4 with the degree of cation ordering refined to be unity (Figures 10 and S14, Tables S18 and S19). Similar results have been obtained for the long-range disordered Zn2TiO4, as can be seen in Figures 11 and S14 and Table S16. However, the length scale of the cation ordering differs drastically for these two compounds: Zn2+ and Sn4+ only orders within one-unit cell length (up to the third cation−cation shells) in Zn2SnO4, while partial Zn2+ and Ti4+ ordering persists up to 18 Å (about the length scale of two-unit cells, Figure S15).

Least-square refinements of the three local structure models of Zn2SnO4 using neutron PDF data (1−8 Å). Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14396 This is consistent with observation that Zn2TiO4 can be synthesized in both long-range cation-ordered and disordered polymorphs by tuning the synthetic condition, while no longrange cation-ordered structure has ever been reported for Zn2SnO4.39 3.5. ZB −ZC > 3 (LiZnNbO4 and Li2TeO4). The electrostatic repulsion dominates for inverse spinel oxides with charge difference larger than three. Such compounds have all been reported to crystallize in the long-range cation-ordered phase with space group P4122. For instance, the confirmation of the long-range Li+/Nb5+ ordering in LiZnNbO4 is shown in Figure S18 and Table S20. To summarize, the degree and the length scale of the octahedral cation ordering in the inverse spinel oxides is strongly correlated with the charge difference (ZB −ZC) and the ionic radii difference (RB −RC), as can be seen in Table 2 and Figure S19. It clearly demonstrates that larger charge and ionic radii difference drives the cations to become more zigzagordered over a longer length scale. This conclusion is fully consistent with the theory proposed above. It also agrees well with the DFT calculations (of the total free energy) of selected inverse spinel oxides with different ionic radii and charge differences (Table S21). 3.6. Beyond the Purely Ionic Model: Concomitant Charge and Orbital Ordering. In the previous section, we have focused on inverse spinel oxides with predominant ionic lattice or on the other extreme with very strong directional (square planar) covalent bonds either from the collective eg orbital ordering (e.g., LiCuVO4) or from the formation of square planar covalent bonds via d−sp2 hybridization. In which, the former drives the octahedral cations to order in the zigzag manner (space group P4122), while the latter promotes linear chain-type cation ordering (space group Imma). Finally, we turn to the remaining case (the fourth point in the above theory) when there is concomitant charge and orbital ordering and these two effects fall within a similar energy scale. Intuitively, very complicated cation ordering schemes are expected to emerge from the competition between these two driving forces due to the similar energy scale. This has indeed been broadly observed for a variety of inverse spinel compounds with multivalent transition metal (TM) cations occupying the octahedral sites, often with nondegenerate t2g orbitals. The most famous example may be the complex Fe2+/ Fe3+ charge ordering in the magnetite Fe3+[Fe2+Fe3+]O4.44,45,85 Other notable examples include the Ir octamers observed in the Cu[Ir3+Ir4+]S4 5,86 and the V heptamer (or the mix of trimer and tetramer as argued by different researchers) in Al[V3+V4+]O4 at elevated temperatures.87−89 The JT coupling of nondegenerate t2g orbitals (to the lattice) are often weak relative to that of the eg ones in the octahedral environment due to the less effective overlap between the t2g orbitals with the ligand oxygen (they do not directly point toward the ligands, Figure S20). Moreover, the spin−orbital coupling is not fully quenched for the t2g orbitals, and it is well-documented that this effect competes with and weakens the JT distortion of the t2g orbitals, especially for the 4d and 5d TM cations.90 Thus, the driving force associated with charge/cation ordering of the t2g orbital ordering is expected to be much weaker relative to that from eg JT distortion. Another notable difference for the t2g orbitals is their orientation (in the octahedral environment), enabling not only the Eg type distortion (either tetragonal or orthorhombic distortion) but also the T2g type distortion of the pyrochlorelike sub lattice (elongation or compression along the diagonal direction in the cubic lattice, Figure S21). This opens the possibility to form not only tetragonal or orthorhombic distorted lattice but also the trigonal distorted lattice, which has indeed been observed in the t2g orbital ordered Al(Ga)V2O4.89,91 It is also worth noting that octahedral sites in spinel oxides share an edge with neighboring octahedron, enabling the direct t2g−t2g orbital overlapping (Figure S22). This direct d−d overlapping plays an important role for the spinel oxides with early 3d or 4d and 5d TM cations,86,90 resulting in the formation of TM clusters with reduced dimensionality of the structure. Thus, the presence of nondegenerate t2g TM cations on the octahedral site introduces enormous amounts of extra orbital degrees of freedom for the inverse spinel compounds, resulting in very complex cation-ordered patterns. A detailed theory to explain these observations falls outside of the scope of the current work, and it is an important and active research topic for modern orbital physics/chemistry.92 Figure 11.

Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14397 In this report, we will use Li[Mn3+Mn4+]O4 as an example to showcase the complex octahedral site charge/cation ordering in inverse spinel oxides with concomitant charge and orbital ordering. LiMn2O4 has attracted tremendous attention in the past few decades.59,93 It is one of the most widely used cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries because of its low cost and low toxicity.94,95 This compound has been broadly reported to crystallize in the cation disordered polymorph (space group Fd3̅m) at room temperature.11 However, a few research groups reported an interesting “phase transition” observed around 280−290 K with a hysteresis of 10 K (Figure 12).96,97 Above this temperature, this compound is a semiconductor (not yet a metal) with a reasonably high electronic conductivity and low activation energy.98 The conductivity drops dramatically upon the phase transition. This behavior is very similar to the conventional Mott metal− insulator transition. However, the higher temperature phase is not a metal but rather a semiconductor (the conductivity still increases as the temperature increases). This resembles the phase transition behavior of many inverse spinel compounds that have octahedral TM cations with the nondegenerate t2g orbitals on the octahedral sites.4,86 Though the long-range charge ordered structure was successfully determined at (∼230K) by the combination of electron diffraction and neutron powder diffraction,97 the “abnormal” charge ordering pattern has not been fully understood.97 This motivates us to investigate the local and long-range cation arrangements in this compound at temperatures higher than 290 K, which may provide useful hints to better understand this interesting phase transition behavior. Since there is strong JT distortion for the high-spin Mn3+ (t2g 3eg 1), and it may therefore induce distorted square planar bonds with the lattice oxygen (mainly from the crystal field splitting or point charge effect, the covalency contribution shall be much weaker relative to that of Cu2+ (t2g 6eg 3) or Ni3+(t2g 6eg 1)). Accordingly, the local cation ordering is likely to be the linear chain-type ordering (here we only consider the situation with B-site of half-filled Mn3+, it is well demonstrated the cubic lattice could be tetragonally distorted, i.e., space group I41/amd, with higher concentration of JT Mn3+).78,96 However, the degree of square planar distortion induced by Mn3+ is likely to be much weaker relative to that of the Cu2+ because of the presence of half-filled t2g orbitals (weaker covalency). Thus, the driving force for cation ordering induced by the eg orbital ordering (predominantly dz 2) is weaker relative to that for Cu2+ (predominantly dx 2−y 2) in the LiCuVO4. However, the dynamic charge transfer between the neighboring (or longer length scale) Mn3+ and Mn4+ may further reduce the actual charge difference between these two cations. This is indeed the case if considering the charge distribution between Mn4+ and O2−, which should be better expressed as Mn(4−δ)+O(2−δ)−instead of Mn4+O2−.99 Therefore, the actual charge difference between these two cations is likely to be much smaller than 1. Therefore, the driving force for cation zigzag-type ordering is also dramatically suppressed in the LiMn2O4. Taken together, the driving forces for both types of cation ordering (P4122 and Imma) are much weaker relative to that of the LiCuVO4. Thus, it is likely that no single effect dominates, and the system is configured in a “frustrated” state. This has indeed been observed for the previously reported structure below the phase transition, as can be seen in Figure 12. This structure can be clearly divided into regions with either zigzag-type cation ordering (P4122-like) or the linear chain-type ordering (Imma-like). Though the long-range charge-ordered structure (below the phase transition) has been successfully resolved, there are a few remaining puzzles for this system: (1) The presence of 4 Mn4+ and 5 Mn3+ in one unit cell contradicts the classic ionic picture of Li+[Mn3+Mn4+]O2. (2) What is the cation arrangement at temperatures above the phase-transition temperature? Are they randomly distributed on the octahedral site or do they form short-range cation-ordered clusters?100 To answer these questions, neutron PDF data of 7LiMn2O4 were collected above the transition temperature at 300 K (Figure 13). The quality of the fit of local neutron PDF using the cationdisordered model (Fd3̅m) is very poor, especially for the first 5 Å (Figure 13a), indicating that Mn3+ and Mn4+ do not randomly occupy a nondistorted octahedral site. The fits improve dramatically (Rwp drops from 15.6% to about 8.6%) by adopting either the cation linear-chain-ordered or the zigzag-ordered model. Despite dramatically improved fits, an obvious discrepancy can be seen between 2.5 and 4 Å for both models. This is likely to be caused by a similar local distortion as that observed in the long-range cation and orbital ordered structure. It is also worth noting that Mn3+ and Mn4+ should have essentially the same nuclear scattering lengths, thus the fit quality of the local neutron PDF is determined by the local distortion rather than the cation/charge ordering. ExceptionFigure 12. (a) Structure of long-range charge-ordered phase of LiMn2O4 (space group F ddd).

Mn3+, Mn4+, and tetramer with mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ are respectively shown in blue, olive, and pink. (b) Illustration of the connection of different Mn3+ and Mn4+ environments. Inorganic Chemistry Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685 Inorg. Chem. 2019, 58, 14389−14402 14398 ally high quality of fit (Rwp ∼3.9%) has been achieved when the long-range charge ordered phase was adopted for the refinement. Since the data was collected at 300 K, only the lattice parameters and thermal parameters of the charge ordered phase (∼290 K) were refined to limit the number of free parameters. This result confirms that charge ordering persists above the phase-transition temperature, at least over a short-range scale (one-unit cell length). Thus, it can be clearly seen that the conventional ionic picture (LiMn3+Mn4+O4) cannot comprehensively describe the local structure of LiMn2O4. It is also worth noting that Mn on the Mn2 site differs from the other two Mn3+ sites (Mn1 and Mn3), the four neighboring Mn2 form a tetrahedron cluster, as can be seen in Figures 13b and S24. One of the elongated bond distances (associated with the JT distortion of Mn2) is refined to 1.997 Å, much shorter distance relative to the other typical elongated Mn−O bonds for Mn3+(around 2.160−2.260 Å, see Table S24 for reference), indicating these four Mn ions (Mn2) likely form a tetramer cation cluster with mixed Mn3+ and Mn4+ character. This is indeed consistent with the calculated bond valence sum (BVS) of 3.38 (using R0 of 1.76 and b of 0.37).101 This can be explained by the resonance of three eg electrons (or one eg hole) among the four Mn2 tetramer ions, a local structure picture that reasonably bridges the conventional ionic picture and the observed local cation clusters. Further theoretical work is required to better understand the underlying driving force for the formation of these resonant Mn3+/Mn4+ tetramers. 4. CONCLUSION The local cation-ordered state in inverse spinel oxides has been successfully determined using combined X-ray and neutron total scattering. The cation zigzag-ordered state (space group P4122) is the ground state for inverse spinel oxides with pure or strong ionic lattice, while cation linear-ordered state (space group Imma) emerges when one of the B-site cations forms very strong directional covalent bonds with lattice oxygen. The degree and length scale of cation ordering increases with the increased charge and ionic radii difference between the two cations. Very complicated cation ordering schemes appear when there is concomitant charge and orbital ordering and these two effects fall on a similar energy scale; this has been widely observed for inverse spinel oxides that have octahedral cations with degenerate t2g orbitals. This often leads to the formation of orbital-driven cation clusters. Similar effect has been observed for LiMn2O4 with the unusually orthorhombically charge ordered state (space group Fddd), with the local cation-ordered “molecule”-like cluster persisting to temperatures above the phase-transition temperature. Further theoretical work, and temperature dependent experimental work following the phase transition behavior, is highly desired to better understand this abnormal “molecule”-like cation ordering behavior. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01685.

A significant structural disorder due to the presence of manganese ions in lithium positions (MnLi) and lithium ions in manganese ones (LiMn) is found to be a common feature of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2. An essential anisotropy of the thermal-expansion coefficients of the lithium manganese oxides is observed in the temperature range of 1.5e 300 K. Furthermore, the distortion of the oxygen octahedral environment around the manganese ions decreases when the temperature lowers. This is attributed to the strong exchange interactions between parallel exchange-coupled Mn chains. First-principles calculations of the effective exchange-interaction parameters in Li16Mn16O32 confirm the essential antiferromagnetic interactions between the chains. In addition, a hypothetical (Li15Mn)Mn16O32 structure where a lithium atom located between the Mn double layers is replaced by a manganese atom is considered. The calculations reveal that the presence of such defects results in appearance of a ferromagnetic component that agrees with the magnetic measurements.  2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Introduction The attempts to create a high-effective cathode material for Li-ion batteries draw an increased attention to the LieMneO systems. Lithium manganese oxide, LiMnO2, is considered as a possible alternative to well-known lithium manganese spinel, LiMn2O4, due to a larger theoretical capacity of the former [1,2]. However, to date, high characteristics of LiMnO2 have not been reached e despite numerous attempts to employ new techniques of synthesis [3e5]. One of the reasons that prevent to achieve the required cathode characteristics in LiMnO2 is the structural peculiarities of this material. Hence, detailed structural investigations of lithium manganese oxides with various defects are of great interest. The orthorhombic structure of LiMnO2 (Pmmn) [6] (Fig. 1) is one of the variants of the ordered rock-salt cubic structure. Strong magnetic interactions between Mn3þ ions and the JahneTeller effect are considered [7] as possible reasons for the stabilization of an orthorhombic structure. These very factors play an important role in magnetic behavior of LiMnO2 as well. Studies of the magnetic properties of both stoichiometric LiMnO2 and that with structural defects are useful because of not only the non-trivial nature of the magnetic interactions but also the possibility to predict the material behavior in the electrochemical cell. The first data on the magnetic properties of the orthorhombic LiMnO2 can be found in Bongers’ report [8], where an antiferromagnetic transition at 300 K was observed. The results * Corresponding author. Tel.: þ7 343 3623442. E-mail address: kellerman@ihim.uran.ru (D.G. Kellerman). 1293-2558/$ see front matter  2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The main features of magnetic susceptibility are the following: the paramagnetic behavior follows the CurieeWeiss law at the temperature above 600 K (Q 1⁄4 949 K, meff 1⁄4 4.79 mB/Mn3þ [10]); a broad maximum of susceptibility polytherms at 360 K and field cooled (fc) and zero field cooled (zfc) divergence below 100 K. The magnetic structure of LiMnO2 with a propagation vector, k 1⁄4 (1/2 1/2 1/2), and magnetic moment 3.69 mB/Mn3þ with a preferred direction along the b-axis has been proposed on the basis of neutron-diffraction data [9]. The Ne ́el temperature, TN, characterizing transition to the phase with three-dimensional order, is 261.5 K [9]. Short-range order effects are observed above this temperature. As shown in Ref. [10], at T > 300 K the magnetic properties of LiMnO2 are well described by a model of exchange-bound chains with an exchange-interaction parameter, J 1⁄4 36.5 cm1. At T < 50 K, magnetic behavior which may be related to weak ferromagnetism, has been observed [9,11]. Here, we employ both experimental and theoretical approaches to study the role of defects in the structural and magnetic properties of lithium manganese oxide LixMnO2. 2. Experiment 2.1. Materials In order to investigate the role of structural defects in the properties of lithium manganese oxides LixMnO2 samples with deficit and excess of lithium were synthesized. Lithium content in starting mixture was 0.94 < x < 1.06. The synthesis has been performed by mixing Mn2O3 and Li2CO3 in calculated proportions, grinding and annealing at 750 C under helium atmosphere for 25 h. The phase composition of the samples was checked by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). In the region 0.97 < x < 1.02, only orthorhombic phase was revealed. At lower lithium concentration traces of spinel phase were detected. The samples with x  1.03 contained Li2MnO3 traces. So the Li0.97MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 compositions were selected to study. Lithium and manganese contents were analyzed using atomic absorption analysis on samples dissolved in 2.5 M hydrochloric acid. The observed Li/Mn ratios are practically the same as the nominal ones (0.98, 1.00 and 1.02, correspondingly). To determine the average manganese oxidation state permanganate back-titration of the reduced samples was performed. It was demonstrated that manganese oxidation state is the same in all samples under consideration and does not differ from that in stoichiometric ‘LiMnO2’. 2.2. Methods Neutron powder diffraction data were collected in the temperature region of 1.5e290 K with a G4.2 neutron powder diffractometer (ORPHEE reactor, Saclay, France; l0 1⁄4 2.343 A ̊ ; 3 < 2q < 174, 0.1 step, Dd/dmin 1⁄4 0.2%). All the XRD patterns were collected on a transmission STADI-P (STOE, Germany) diffractometer equipped with a scintillation detector, using Cu Ka1 radiation in the 2q range 2e120 with a step of 0.02. Polycrystalline silicon (a 1⁄4 5.43075(5) A ̊ ) was used as external standard. The ‘‘Base of JCPDS-ICDD PDF2 powder standards’’ (ICDD, USA, version 2005) was used for identification of possible impurity phases. The crystal structure of the Fig. 1.

Kellerman et al. / Solid State Sciences 9 (2007) 196e204 samples studied was refined by a GSAS program [12] using both neutron and X-ray data. Line profile was approximated by the pseudo-Voigt function: I(2Q) 1⁄4 hL(2Q)þ(1  h)G(2Q), where L and G are the Lorentz and Gauss functions, respectively; and the angular line-width of a linewas done by the relationship: (FWHM)2 1⁄4 Utg2Q þ VtgQ þ W, where FWHM is a full line width on the half maximum. Background level was specified as a combination of 15 Chebyshev polynomials. Magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range of 1.5e 300 K was measured by a MPMS-5XL (Quantum Design) SQUID-magnetometer in the fields up to 50 kOe, while at 77e1000 K, it was done by the Faraday method in fields up to 10 kOe. 2.3. Theoretical methods First-principles electronic structure investigations were performed within a linearized muffin-tin orbitals method [13] in the atomic-spheres approximation (LMTO-ASA). The effective exchange-interaction parameters were calculated as the second derivative of total energy of the ground state with respect to the angle of the magnetic-moment rotation [14]. To determine the exchange-interaction parameters between the nearest manganese atoms (or next nearest ones) that belong to (1) the same structural layer, (2) two closest structural layers in a double layer, or (3) different double layers, a supercell containing 16 formula units of LiMnO2 was used. In addition, 64 empty spheres were introduced into the system because the structure is not close-packed. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Refinement of the crystal structure of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 Structural data refined for three compositions of LixMnO2 are shown in Tables 1 and 2. (Standard deviations are given in brackets; r and n indices stand for the X-ray and neutron data, respectively.) These results are in good agreement with those obtained previously in Ref. [6]. Based on the small differences in the chemical composition of the samples under consideration, one can argue that the structural parameters should not vary essentially. However, the detailed analysis of data given in Tables 1 and 2, reveal some important tendencies. First, we note that the size of the unit cell of LixMnO2 increases with lithium concentration. Lattice expansion is observed in all directions and may be attributed to the difference between the ionic radii of manganese and lithium. A common feature of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2 and Li1.02MnO2, detected during full-profile analysis of X-ray and neutron data, is a structural disorder caused by the presence of manganese ions in lithium positions (MnLi) and lithium ions in manganese ones (LiMn). Previously the cationic disorder in LiMnO2 was assumed both from the analysis of the ESR-spectra [11], and from X-ray diffraction study [15]. The results of the calculations suggest that both LiO6 and MnO6 octahedra are strongly distorted as well and are elongated along the b-axes. The tetragonal distortion observed for the oxygen octahedra, which is found to be around 19% at room temperature, is due to the JahneTeller effect. The type of tetragonal distortion in LiMnO2 suggests that the Mn3þ(3d4) has the electron configuration t3 2gd1 z2d0 x2y2. The parameters of the orthorhombic cell of LiMnO2 are related to a hypothetical parent cubic lattice parameter (a0) by the following formulae: a 1⁄4 1/2O2a0, b 1⁄4 a0, and c 1⁄4 O2a0 (*) [16], it follows that b/a z 1.41, b/c z 0.707, and c/a 1⁄4 2. However, the experimental structural ratios (Table 3) suggest that the b-parameter of the orthorhombic lattice is considerably larger than the theoretically predicted one using (*). Thus, we can conclude that in the case of LiMnO2, notable ‘‘tetragonal’’ distortions of the structure exist, and JahneTeller effect has Table 1 Orthorhombic unit cell parameters of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2 and Li1.02MnO2 Parameter Li0.98MnO2 Li1.00MnO2 Li1.02MnO2 a (A ̊ ) 2.80473(4) 2.80644 (3) 2.80661(2) B (A ̊ ) 4.57419(8) 4.57536(7) 4.57749(4) c (A ̊ ) 5.74873(9) 5.75092(8) 5.75147(5) V (A ̊ 3) 73.753(2) 73.845(2) 73.891(1) Table 2 Structural and isotropic thermal (Uiso (A ̊ 2)) parameters for Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2 and Li1.02MnO2 (s.g.

Kellerman et al. / Solid State Sciences 9 (2007) 196e204 a cooperative character. This is pointed out by the correlation between the changes in the unit cell parameters and the distortions of the local oxygen neighbors of the manganese ions, in particular, when the temperature decreases (Table 3, Fig. 2c). Let us follow the changes in the structural parameters of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 when the temperature decreases from 300 to 1.5 K. Analysis of neutrondiffraction data shows that the lattice compression occurs along each of the three directions in this temperature range. However, whereas the relative change of the a and c parameters for each composition does not exceed 0.1%, the compression of the orthorhombic lattice along the b-axis is one order of magnitude larger than along the other two directions (Fig. 2a,b). Besides that when the temperature decreases, the local environment of lithium and manganese atoms changes due to a decrease of the degree of distortion of the oxygen octahedra (Fig. 2c). Anisotropy of the thermal-expansion coefficients of lithium manganese oxide can also be demonstrated based on the relative change of the unit cell parameters (Table 3). Reduction of the b/c and b/a ratios points to a decrease of the tetragonal distortions at lower temperatures. Usually, a stable macroscopic distortion of a crystal caused by the JahneTeller effect is observed at rather low temperatures [17]. As the temperature increases, an entropy term prevails over the interaction related to the cooperative distortion of the lattice and this tends eventually to suppress the macroscopic deformation. In this sense, the observed behavior of LiMnO2 is non-trivial because the deformation lowers not when the temperature increases but when it decreases. The observed reduction of the oxygen octahedra distortion in Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 (Fig. 2), testifies that there are some additional competitive interactions in the system which are responsible for the compression of the octahedra as the temperature decreases.

Kellerman et al. / Solid State Sciences 9 (2007) 196e204 lithium manganese oxide, the interactions that counteract such deformation should be along the same axis. In our opinion, the exchange interactions between manganese ions can play an important role. As considered earlier in Ref. [10], the magnetic properties of LiMnO2 are well described by a model of parallel exchange-coupled chains of Mn atoms. The chains are arranged along the a-axis (Fig. 1). The half-filled dz2 orbitals elongated in the direction perpendicular to the chain are involved in the exchange between the chains, namely in the indirect 180 exchange through the oxygen ion located between two manganese ions (Fig. 3). The phenomenon that leads to reduction of the degree of the oxygen-octahedron distortion and to anisotropic compression of lithium manganese oxide lattice may be considered as a magnetostriction effect: the total energy of the crystal decreases due to the magnetocrystal energy changes caused by stress and hence the changes in the exchange-interaction energy [18]. Using CoO as an example, Kanamori has considered the exchange interactions as possible origin of the striction effects [19]. 3.2. First-principles calculations of the exchange-interaction parameters in Li16Mn16O32 In order to show that the interchains exchange interactions are important and may cause striction effects, we calculated the main exchange-interaction parameters in the orthorhombic structure of LiMnO2 as shown in Fig. 4. The results are summarized in Table 4. To determine the exchange-interaction parameters between the nearest manganese atoms (or next nearest ones) that belong to (1) the same structural layer, (2) two closest structural layers in a double layer, or (3) different double layers, a supercell containing 16 formula units of LiMnO2, was used in calculations to make it possible to determine the values of exchange interactions between the nearest manganese atoms (or next nearest ones) being among (1) a structure layer, (2) various structure layers, and (3) different double layers. Thus the total number of atoms in a supercell is 64. Furthermore, in addition, 64 empty spheres were introduced into the system because this structure was not closepacked. First of all, we found a strong anisotropy of the exchange interaction e in agreement with our experimental results mentioned above: according to the peculiarities of the crystal structure of LiMnO2, the largest exchange-interaction parameter is obtained for the linear chains along the a-axis. This interaction is antiferromagnetic with J1 1⁄4 86.28 meV. We note, however, that antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn chains is also strong, J2 1⁄4 62.41 meV. Further, the calculated exchange-interaction parameters between the Mn3þ ions which belong to a double layer, J4 and J5, are three times smaller than those along the chains, while the exchange interactions between double layers are negligible. The total parameter characterizing the interaction in a layer is one order of magnitude larger than the one corresponding to the interaction between double layers (Table 4).

Kellerman et al. / Solid State Sciences 9 (2007) 196e204 Thus, first-principles calculations show that the exchange interaction between manganese ions, which belong to the parallel chains along the a-axis, is large and may be responsible for striction effects leading to the lessening of the octahedra deformation when the temperature decreases. 3.3. Li1xMnxO2 magnetic structure and properties As shown in Refs. [9] and [10], the magnetic susceptibility of LiMnO2 has a number of peculiarities. First, a broad maximum is observed near 360 K. This temperature is essentially higher than the Ne ́el temperature. The maximum has been attributed to the presence of the exchange-coupled clusters, and infinite chains along the a-axis have been considered as such clusters [10]. At the temperature of maximum the thermal energy becomes comparable to the energy of the exchange interactions, so the magnetic chains break down transforming gradually into an ensemble of single paramagnetic centers. As seen from Fig. 5, chains with smaller concentration of LiMndefects are maintained up to a higher temperature: 358, 366, and 380 K for Li1.02MnO2 Li1.00MnO2, and Li0.98MnO2, respectively. Thus, the existence of the over-stoichiometry lithium in LixMnO2 results in weakening of the two-dimensional interactions. Additional reflections attributed to the magnetic-ordering process were detected on the neutron-diffraction powder patterns of all considered samples at T < TN. There is a regular increase of the intensity of the magnetic reflections as the temperature decreases. Rietveld refinement of the nuclear and magnetic components of the spectra using a GSAS program complex, shows that main characteristics of the magnetic structure are independent of the lithium/manganese relation and coincide with the results [9] obtained for the stoichiometric LiMnO2. Our calculations demonstrate that for all compositions, the magnetic unit cell is characterized by the doubled parameters in all three directions: 2a  2b  2c. The results of the refinement of the magnetic structure of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 at 1.5 K are given in Table 5. The magnetic structure of LiMnO2 consists of antiferromagnetically ordered chains along the a-axis. The interaction between the chains located in the same plane is antiferromagnetic as well. Antiferromagnetic interaction also binds (i) the chains located within a corrugation layer and (ii) the neighboring chains. Furthermore, all magnetic moments are ordered along the b-axis of the orthorhombic structure of LiMnO2 (Fig. 1). We note here, that the results of the refinement of the magnetic structure agree with the results of the first-principles calculations that show that the main interactions in lithium manganese oxide have an antiferromagnetic character. An increase of the lithium concentration in LixMnO2 favors some changes of the magnetic cell constants (Table 5). Besides, certain changes are found in the value of the magnetic moment that corresponds to the manganese ion. This is clearly seen from both the data given in Table 5 and the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment (Fig. 6). A decrease of the magnetic moment when the temperature increases is quite a usual behavior that reflects disappearance of the magnetic order. However, while the variations in the values of the magnetic moment for Li0.98MnO2 and Li1.00MnO2 are within the error limits, the mMn for Li1.02MnO2 is much lower (around 8%). The lower magnetic moments for the composition with higher concentrations of lithium may be related to the presence of LiMn-type defects which are not involved in the formation of the regular magnetic structure. From the data for the position occupancy given in Table 2, one can see that this composition is characterized by the presence of maximum quantity of the lithium ions in the manganese positions. Another important thing that should be noted here, is that for each of the three compositions studied, the value of the 200 400 600 800 1000 T, K 20 22 24 26 χ*106, cm3/g 1 2 3 2LiMnO2 ( ) 1Li0.98MnO2( ) 3Li1.02MnO2( ) Fig. 5.

Kellerman et al. / Solid State Sciences 9 (2007) 196e204 magnetic moment is significantly lower than the theoretical value for Mn3þ (3d4), i.e. 4 mB. Greedan et al. [9] reported the reduced value of the magnetic moment of 3.69(4) mB/ Mn3þ for LiMnO2 too. In our opinion, this fact points to the previously discussed phenomenon of a partial disorder of the structure leading to a reduction of the number of the manganese ions which participate in the formation of the magnetic structure. The temperature that corresponds to the magnetic order transition is not observed in a c(T ) curve (Fig. 7a), however, it can be easily determined from temperature dependence, d(cT )/dT. The basis for this are the conclusions drawn in Ref. [20] where the temperature dependence of the heat capacity for an antiferromagnetic system correlates with the temperature dependence of the derivative of the magnetic susceptibility with respect to the temperature. As followed from a l-type dependence given in Fig. 8, the temperature of the antiferromagnetic ordering is 259 K (it is close to results of Ref. [9]) and it is independent of the composition. Above this temperature, a long-range 3D magnetic order is distorted but the exchange-bound clusters are still present. For their distortion, a significantly higher energy is required e it can be estimated by the temperature compatible with the maximum of the magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 5). At the temperatures below 100 K, a discrepancy in fcand zfc-dependences of the magnetic susceptibility has been observed for each of the LixMnO2 compositions. In agreement with the sharp increase of the susceptibility when the temperature decreases, the discrepancy points out to the appearance of a ferromagnetic component. An example of the low-temperature part of the magnetic susceptibility of stoichiometric LiMnO2 is shown in Fig. 7a. As was already mentioned above, a weak ferromagnetism (small sublattice canting) can be the reason for the ferromagnetic component in the antiferromagnetic phase. It turns out that the sensitivity of the neutron-diffraction investigations carried out both within this study and by the authors of Ref. [9] was inadequate to determine any direction and value of the magnetic moments. However, both the decrease of the magnetic moment (Fig. 6) determined for the antiferromagnetic structure in the area of the presence of the assumed weak ferromagnetic state (WFM) and the hysteresis of the magnetization in the same temperature region (Fig. 7b) favor the hypothesis considered. Moreover, the fact that the WFM originates at the temperature being considerably lower than the Ne ́el one is a characteristic feature of WFM in both the stoichiometric and defective lithium manganese oxide.

Kellerman et al. / Solid State Sciences 9 (2007) 196e204 It is interesting to understand the reason which is responsible for the ferromagnetic component formation at around 50 K in the 3D antiferromagnetic LixMnO2. Our calculations show that MnLi-type defects, the presence of which is demonstrated by the experimental structural investigations, may play an important role. 3.4. First-principles calculations of the exchange-interaction parameters in (Li15Mn)Mn16O32 Using first-principles approach, we also studied a hypothetical structure of (Li15Mn)Mn16O32 where the lithium atoms located between the Mn double layers are replaced by manganese atoms (Table 4, Fig. 9). A comparison of the effective exchange-interaction parameters calculated for such ‘‘defective’’ structure with those for Li16Mn16O32 mentioned above, allows us to draw the following conclusions: due to a strong exchange interaction between the ‘‘defect’’ (manganese atom in lithium position) and the nearest manganese atom from the double layer (Jdef 1⁄4 49.71 meV), the interlayer interaction decreases by a factor of 1.6, whereas a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between double layers of manganese changes to ferromagnetic and becomes stronger. Thus, the theoretical results demonstrate that the ferromagnetic component that is predicted from the magnetic measurements given in Fig. 7a (inset) may be due to the presence of the manganese ions in lithium layers. Another peculiarity that should be mentioned here, is that the strong exchange interaction in the layer (J1 1⁄4 86.28 meV and J2 1⁄4 62.41 meV) decreases slightly for the ‘‘defect’’ structure (J1 1⁄4 77.03 meV and J2 1⁄4 58.26 meV) so that these interactions are comparable in magnitude to the exchange interactions between this ‘‘defect’’ and the manganese atoms located in the same plane with the defect along cdirection, i.e. perpendicular to the Mn layers: namely, the nearest manganese atom (Jdef 1⁄4 49.71 meV) and the next nearest ones (J1-defect 1⁄4 þ41.09 meV and >J9defect 1⁄4 þ71.94 meV). Therefore, we conclude that the presence of the defects make the structure to be isotropic. 4. Summary The crystal structure of Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 studied using both neutron and X-ray data is found to be partially disordered due to the presence of manganese ions in lithium positions (MnLi) and lithium ions in manganese ones (LiMn). The defects are responsible both for the difference between magnetic properties of LixMnO2 with various Li/Mn ratios and for the appearance of weak ferromagnetism. The latter was demonstrated by the first-principles calculations for the hypothetical (Li15Mn)Mn16O32. The reduction both of the oxygen octahedra distortion in Li0.98MnO2, Li1.00MnO2, and Li1.02MnO2 and JahneTeller effect as temperature decreases were observed. Exchange interactions between infinite Mn3þe/Mn3þe/Mn3þ chains were considered as the possible reason for this phenomenon.

HaganmuHer) ABSTRACT Spinel related compounds LixMn02k , 0.02~ x <0.50, are obtained from the spinel type LiMn 2 04 by solid-liquid reaction with various oxidizing agents. A new tetragonal phase, LiMnO2k, having the rocksalt structure has been prepared at ambiant temperature by lithium intercalation with n-butyl lithium into Lio.02 MnO 2~ or LiMn20 4. X-ray and electron diffraction studies and crystal structure refinements of both Lio.02 MnO2k and LiMnO2k show that the manganese ions occupy the same octahedral sites in all compounds as in LiMn204. Introduction Les travaux r~cents de Hunter (i) ont montr~ que le traitement du spinelle LiMn 2 0 4 par des solutions aqueuses acides permet d'obtenir temperature ambiante Lie Mn02k avec ¢ = 0,04. La r~action implique la dismutation du Mn III avec passage en solution de lithium et de manganese II selon la r@action : + 2+ 3 (R) (2-x)LiMn204+(4-8x)H3 O+ ÷ 3LixMnO2+(2-4x)Liaq+(1-2x)Mnaq+~ (4-8x)H20 Selon Hunter, le pH se stabilise rapidement, le produit obtenu est soit LieMn02l soit un m@lange de LizMn021 et du solide de d~part LiMn204 (1). Li xMn02 ~ est une phase m~tastable qui, par chauffage ~ l'air, se transforme en MnO 2 8 . La temperature de transformation varie selon les auteurs: 258 ou 6ooc. (1)(2).

Plueieurs chauffaEes de 12 het broyagee successifs assurent une bonne homogeneitY. Les produits sont refroidis lentement jusqu'~ 820°C pour assurer une bonne stoechiom~trie. En effet une ~t~de pr@liminaire a montr~ qu'une trempe effectu@e ~ partir d'une temperature comprise entre 820 et 880°C conduit LiMn20~_y avec 0 < y < 0,09. La presence de lacunes anioniques entra~ne alors une distorsion quadratique du spinelle avec 1 ( c/a < 0,978. Deux dioxydes de manEan&se ont ~t~ utilis~s : un produit Merck "MnO 2 pr@cipit~ actif" et un produit Alfa-Ventron "MnO 2 99,8 %" qui conduiaent & deux produits LiMn204 de granulom@tries diff~rentes, respectivement A (cristaux de diam~tres tr~s voisins de 1 wm) et B (cristaux de diam~tres eompris entre 2 et 5 ~m). LixMnO2A a ~t~ pr~par~ soit par action d'oxydants dissous dans l'eau (Br2, H202, K2S208 ) ou l'ac6tonitrile (Bra, Ie) soit par la m~thode de Hunter pour des pH fixes compris entre 0,5 et 7. La dur6e des r~actions en milieu acide a ~t~ fix~e ~ 5 h, les produits obtenus sont filtr6s, laves et finalement s~ch~s ~ l'air ~ lO0°C. L'insertion du lithium est effectu6e quantitativement ~ temperature ambiante ~ l~aide d'une solution dilu6e de n butyl lithium dans l'hexane afin d'@viter une trop importante ~l~vation de temp6rature lots de la r~action.

C'est ainsi que les oxydants Br2 2 ou& K2S208 conduisent comme les solutions acides de pH initial inf~rieur ~ LieMnO2A avec ¢ = 0,04. Les Vol. 18, No. 11 LixMnO2k 1377 valeurs minimales de x obtenues avec H202 et 12 sont respectivement 0,26 et 0,40 dans nos conditions exp~rimentales (tableau I).

La r~action (R) est tr~s rapide lorsque le pH est inf~rieur ~ 2,5 ; pour des pH plus ~lev~s la diminution de la vitesse lorsque le pH augmente devient importante. Lorsque LixMnO 2 k est pr~par~ par oxydation en milieu aqueux neutre, une faible fraction (i ~ 5 %) du manganese pr@sent dans le solide initial (LiMn 2 0 4 ) passe en solution, en raison d'une faible contribution de la r~action (R). Quelques r@sultats typiques sont donn~s dans le tableau I. La teneur en oxyg~ne est le plus souvent quasi ~gale ~ la valeur id~ale, elle en est toujours tr~s proche. Les diagrammes de diffraction X sur poudre (figure i) peuvent ~tre interpr~t~s ~ l'aide d'un r~seau cubique ~ faces centr~es dont le param~tre a varie avec x (figure 2), tout au moins pour les valeurs de x, telles que 0,40<x<0,50 et 0,02 <x<0,16. Pour des valeurs interm~diaires (la valeur particuli~re x = 0,25 ~tant exclue car elle fera l'objet d'une discussion plus approfondie), on observe en plus des raies du r~seau cubique F une raie faible (d ~2,05 ~). Cette raie a ~t~ ant~rieurement attribute ~ LiMn204 (i). Cette interpretation ne saurait ~tre retenue car les raies les plus intenses de LiMn204 n'apparaissent pas dans le diagramme de poudre.

L'abaissement de sym@trie pour la plupart des cristaux est organis@ ~ moyenne et grande distance, il entraSne un "~clatement" des tales du diagramme de poudre (figure i).

Vol. 18, No. 11 LixMnO2k 1379 Ii y a donc pour la phase Lio,25MnO2k ~tablissement d'un ordre ~ plus ou moins longue distance selon la nature du LiMn204 utilis~ pour la preparation et m~me au sein d'une mSme preparation.

La mise en ordre n'a pu ~tre am~lior~e par traitement thermique : LixMnO 2 k se d~oompose par chauffage d~s 180°C pour x ~ 0,3. La pr@sence de Li + en site octa~drique est a priori exclue sur la base de simples eonsid@rations ~lectrostatiques dans de telles phases (2). Cependant il n'est pas tout ~ fair invraisemblable que, lorsque pour x = 0,25 une distorsion appara~t, elle puisse entra~ner la stabilisation d'une fraction des lithiums en sites octa~driques. Le compos~ LiMnO 2 La mise en presence de (x-O,02) n But-Li et de Lio,o2MnO2k conduit quantitativement ~ un m~lange de Lio,o2Mn02 ~ et de LiMn20 g pour x < 0,5. Pour x voisin de 1 une phase m~tastable hygroscopique est obtenue, nous la d~signerons par LiMnO2k. Cette phase pr~sente un domaine de non stoechiom~trie qui traduit la formulation Lil_zMn02k avee 05 z < 0,2. Lorsque x est sup~rieur i, on obtient un m~lange de LiMnO2k et d'une phase non identifi~e. LiMnO2k peut ~galement ~tre obtenu par r~action de LiMn20 ~ avec le butyl lithium. Par chauffage sous azote au del~ de 500°C, LiMnO2k se transforme en LiMnO 2 orthorhombique d~j& connu (3). A 500°C, la transformation est lente, elle n'est totale qu'apr~s plusieurs jours. Le chauffage ~ l'air de LiMnO2k conduit ~ 800°C, ~ un m~lange de LiMn204 et Li2MnO 3. La phase LiMn02k a @t~ caract~ris~e par diffraction neutronique et diffraction X. L'excellent ~tat de cristallisation de cette phase pr~par~e l'ambiante, nous a conduit ~ v~rifier l'hypoth~se, que le sous r~seau [Mn 2 ] 04 de Li[Mn2]O 4 est conserv~ dans LiMn02k , & ceci pros qu'une distorsion quadratique est observ~e. Ii lui correspond un rapport c/a = 1,16 tr~s voisin de ceux observes dans de nombreux spinelles (4) tels que : MII[MI~I] 04 avec M = Zn, Cd, Mg, Co, Mn. L'affinement a ~t~ effectu~ dans le groupe I41/amd. Le d~licat probl~me de la localisation du lithium a ~t~ r~solu en testant les diff~rentes hypotheses de r~partition apr~s avoir fix~ le facteur d'agitation thermique isotrope ~ la valeur B = 0,5 ~ (le dernier affinement a conduit ~ une valeur l~g~rement plus faible). Les valeurs de R et R w les plus basses sont obtenues lorsque Li occupe compl~tement les sites octa~driques (figure 3). Le tableau II donne les r~sultats de l'affinement.

Morales, C. P4rez-Vicente, and J.L. Tirado Departamento de Qufmica InorgAnica e Ingenier~a Qu~mica. Facultad de Ciencias. Universidad de C6rdoba. 14004 C6rdoba. Spain. (Received February 12, 1990; Communicated by P. Hagenmuller) ABSTRACT Cation distribution in Lit.xNi1~xO 2 was studied by Rietvelt analysis of XRD data. The occupancy levels of 3a and 3b sites by Ni and Li atoms approach as x increases, leading to a statistical distribution for x k 0.4. Acid treatment of these oxides causes the solid to be partly dissolved. The remaining oxide shows divergences in chemical composition and XRD patterns which can be associated with lithium deintercalation. This process is accompanied by a decrease in the rhombohedral angle, a. The thermal behaviour of acid-treated samples is characterized by the occurrence of a spinel phase at ca. 270°C. MATERIALS INDEX: oxides, lithium, nickel Introduction Precise knowledge about the structure and reactivity of lithium/transition-metal mixed oxides with layered, NaCl-related, structures has been gathered in recent years, as a result of the interest in their intercalationdeinterealation and ion-exchange chemistry. In the stoichiometric LiMO 2 phases (M: V, Cr, Co and Ni), alternate layers of Li and M cations occupy the octahedral sites of a compact cubic packing of oxide anions, making up a rhombohedral structure with a R3m space group, Li in 3b, M in 3a and 0 in 6c sites (i). In addition, non-stoichiometric phases preserving the layered structure can be obtained by chemical and electrochemical delithiation processes (2-5). On the other hand, non-stoichiometrie phases in a wide compositional range can be obtained by conventional ceramic synthetic methods. This has been shown for the Li-Ni-O system, the preparation conditions of which have a direct effect on the composition of oxides with a Lilo×Ni1+xO 2 stoichiometry (5,6). However, the cation distribution in these phases has not yet been examined, although the limiting cases LiNiO~ (R3m) and LixNii_xO (x ~ 0.3) (5,7) (random cation distribution, Fm3m, NaCI structure) and NiO pseudocubic (NaC] structure) have been accurately characterized~ 623 624 J. MORALES, et al. Vol. 25, No. 5 The Rietvelt method for estimation of cation distributions from powder diffraction data has been successfully applied to various systems (8,9,15). Although the low scattering power of lithium does not allow the precise refinement of Li-positions from X-ray data, the differences in scattering powers of Li and Ni can be exploited to gain a better understanding of the structural variations found in Lil.xNil÷xO 2 phases. On the other hand, the electrochemical lithium deintercalation in LiNiO z yields the metastable phase Li0,sNiO2, which is transformed into the normal cubic spinel phase Li[Ni2]O ~ above 200°C (5). By contrast, the chemical delithiation and lithium exchange properties of rhombohedral LiNiO 2 have not been reported so far. Moreover, the marked lack of stoichiometry of this mixed oxide (6) may play an important role in the composition and structure of the products of Li-extraction reactions. This paper reports a study on the structure and chemical deintercalation reactions of Lil_ x Ni~,×O 2 samples. Experimental Two Li/Ni mixed oxide samples were prepared by the conventional ceramic procedure by annealing mixtures of Ni(II) hydroxycarbonate and lithium carbonate at 875°C for 18 h under a constant 02 flow-rate. The products were washed with absolute ethanol, dried at 100°C and stored in a vacuum desiccator with P~Ot0. The HC1 treatment was carried out by adding 100 ml of 1:50 v/v 36 % HC1 to 2.5 g of sample and stirring the mixture at 25°C for 20 h. The solid products were isolated by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried at 100°C and stored in a desiccator. The average oxidation state of Ni was determined by adding 10 ml of 0.1 M Fe(II), 10 ml of 96 % H2SO~ and 10 ml of 85 % HaPO ~ to 40-60 mg of sample while passing an Ar stream. The solution was back-titrated with standard 0.02 M K2Cr207 using diphenilamine as indicator. Total Ni content was titrated with 0.1 M EDTA after dissolution of similar amounts of sample in concentrated HC1 and neutralization with NH~OH. Li/Ni ratios were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. XRD patterns were obtained on a Siemens D500 diffractometer using CuKa radiation and a graphite monochromator. Step-scan recordings at 0.05°20 step sizes and 8 s counting times were used in the Rietveld analysis, which was implemented by a computer program described elesewhere (10). IR data were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer 599A spectrophotometer. TG traces were recorded on a Cahn 2000 electrobalance at 10°C/rain, heating rate under a static air atmosphere. Transmission electron micrographs were recorder on a JEOL 200 CX microscope. Results and Discussion The various samples prepared at 875°C under different 02 flow-rates were obtained as dark-grey powders with XRD patterns ascribable to a single phase with a LiNiO2-related structure (6) (Fig. 1 A and B). No extra reflections resulting from structural changes or the presence of impurities were detected. Washing the samples with ethanol thus removed undesirable lithium compounds which might interfere with the determination of the chemical composition and the structural refinement. On Lbe other' hand, a comparison of the relative intensities of the reflections with those of stoichiometric LiNiO 2 revealed significant divergences. These call be ascribed to structural changes and/or preferred Vol. 25, No. 5 MIXED OXIDES 625 TABLE I Li/Ni ratio, average oxidation state (OS) of Ni and stoichiometry of samples A, A1, A2, B and B1.

The layered structure of LiMO 2 phases commonly results in a plate-like habit normal to the [001] in the particles of powdered samples of these solids (11,12). However, the electron microscopic images of the samples (Fig. 2) showed these to have little tendency to form regular plates, and several preferred zone axes besides [001] were observed. In addition, changes in particle width were evidenced by the different contrast observed at the particle surfaces. From these data, the effect of preferred orientation may not be a determining factor affecting the intensities of the XRD patterns. Moreover, the samples were prepared so as to minimize these effects. Table I (A and B) lists the chemical compositions of selected samples. It is worth noting that the observed average oxidation state of Ni is lower than expected for stoichiometric LiNiO 2. A direct reationship between the O 2 flow-rate used during the preparation and the observed oxidation state is also found. Oxidation states close to 2.48 have been reported (6) to arise from the temperature of preparation. In our experimental procedure, the different oxidation states were_lobtained by changing the 02 flow-rate during the process between 100 ml rain (sample B) and 200 ml rain (sample A) at 875°C. The Li/Ni ratios of these samples (Table I) are consistent with the average oxidation state of Ni (OS) (OS = 2 + Li/Ni). Thus, a stoichiometry such as Li¢.xNii, x O:z is consistent with the above results. As the Ni/O ratios in these samples are higher than 0.5, cation distribution in these non-stoichiometric samples should allow for the presence of Ni atoms in positions different from the 3a set of the R3m s.g.. On the other hand, Li/O ratios lower than 0.5 imply that the 3b equivalent positions are not fully occupied by lithium. Thus, a partial occupation of 3b sites by nickel may be admitted. This is consistent x, ith the tendency of Ni(II), Ni(lII) and Ni(IV) ions to occupy octahedral and tetragonally distorted octahedral sites. A cation distribution of the type [Lil_~Ni~]ab[Ni]3a[O2]s¢ should not have too marked an effect on the unit cell parameters of the rombohedral solid. For x : 1, the resulting solid is NiO, with a NaC1 structure. Thus, the unit cell parameter of pseudocubic NiO con\erted to a rombohedral unit cell with the same number of oxygen layers as the unit cell of LiNiO 2 leads to a : 5.907 1% and ~ : 60 °, while rombohedrally distorted NiO yields a : 5.904 ,~ and (~ : 60.075 ° (13). These values are close to those found for stoichiometric IANiO 2 (a : 5.781 ~, ~ :59.72) (6), However, changes in layer occupancy have a direct effect on the X-ray intensity ratios. These changes are specia]ly evident for the I003/I10 ~ ratio, as the 104 (R3m) or 400 (Fm3m) line is 626 J. MORALES, et al.

Figure 3 shows the plot of calculated I00~/II0 ~ ratios vs. the Li/Ni ratio obtained by assuming the above described structural model. The experiental values obtained for sample A are quite consistent with this model. The Rietveld analysis of XRD data for sample A reveals good agreemeP, t between the experimental profile and the structural model, as evidenced by the low R values (Table II). It is worth noting that G001 is 0.0 for both samples, thus indicating the absence of preferred orientation phenomena. The values of r] (Table II) show that the profiles are accurately described by pseudo-Voigt functions with a similar Gauss and Lorentz contribution. U, V and W show a low broadening of the profiles due to the enhanced sample crystallinity resulting from the application of the ceramic method. The values of the structural parameters ~R, a~ and z 0 (hexagonal), shown in Table If, are intermediate between those found for LiNiO 2 and NiO, in agreement with the partial filling of the 3b sites of the rhombohedral structure with Ni ions. c~ is closer to 60 ° and z 0 to 0.25 than in stoichiometrie LiNiO 2. These results imply that Lil. ~Nit+ n O 2 oxides with x < 0.1 differ from stoichiometric LiNiO 2 in the partial substitution of Li by Ni in the interlayer region. For sample B, with a Li/Ni ratio lower than sample A, Fig. 3 shows a significant divergence from this model. The Rietveld analysis showed poor fitting of the experimental XRD profile. However, if a fraction of Ni atoms in the 3a sites is substituted by Li atoms, different curves can be obtained by plotting Io0s/Ilo ~ vs. Li/Ni {Fig. 3). For 8 % substitution, the agreement with the experimental value for sample B is somewhat better. Thus, the Rietveld analysis was carried out from a starting structural model of the tspe: [Li0.osNi0. sz]sa[Li0,e0Ni0,~0]3~[O2]G~. This model is intermediate between the proposed structure for sample A and Li~Nil_xO (Fm3m} for x < 0.1 (7}, for which a random distribution of cations was observed in both octahedral layers. The results of the Rietveld refinement of sample B, shown in Table If, reveal good agreement with this model. Again, the structural parameters a&, ~x~ and z o (hexagonal) are intermediate between those of stoichiometric LiNiO~ and NiO, but closer to those of the latter phase than to those of sample A. From these results can be concluded that large x values in the general formula of the non-stoichiometric phases lead to a distribution of Li and Ni ions in both sets of octahedral sites with a marked tendency to a statistical cation distribution (NaCl-type structure). The room temperature treatment of A and B samples with HCI resulted in partial dissolution, accompanied by CI z release, consistent with earlier reports (6). The solid products form this treatment showed changes in the chemical composition (see Table I) and XRD patterns (Fig. 1). The Li/Ni ratios decreased gradually with the reaction time (see A, A1 and A2), thus indicating the occ~a'rence of lithium extraction or a proton exchange reaction. The possibility that a Li+/H * exchange may take place was examined by recording the IR spectra of the diferent san_~I~les. As in LiNiO 2 (1), no absoption effects were detected in the 4000-1600 cm frequency range, in contrast with HCoO2, {iso~tructltral with tiNiO 2) which shows a broad IR absoption band at ca. 1800 cm (14). In addition, any proton exchange should lead to a marked decrease in ~he ,mit cell ~'~parameter, as found in LiCoO2/HCoO 2 (ii) and LiCrO2/HCrO 2 (12), or complex structural changes leading to spinel-type phases as found in ~--LiNIO 2 (]5). None of these effects were detected in our samples, which thus 628 J. MORALES, et al.

On the other hand, as can be seen in Table I, the average Ni oxidation state increases gradually with the length of the HC1 treatment. This can be related with the above mentioned delithiation process. The experimental Li/Ni and Ni(OS) values can be summarized in the chemical compositions, also shown in Table I, by assuming the initial oxygen paeldng to remain unaltered. From these formulae, it is worth noting that sample B has decreased Ni/O and Li/Z'i ratios. This ma,v be interpreted in terms of a loss of interla,ver Ni ions (in addition to Li +) throughout the HC1 treatment. After equal reac¢ion time~-~, the Ni/O ratios are similar (compare A1 with B1), while further treatment of the A1 sample affects the Li/Ni ratios exclusively. These results allow the reactions induced by the HC1 treatment to be derived. First, the chemical delithiation caused by the acid treatment #ould be written independently of the observed C12 release as: 2(1-x+y) I, il_xNil+×Oz, + 85" H ÷ -+ 2(1-x) Lil_×_yNil+×Oz, + + 2y(l+x) Ni z+ + 3y(1-x) Li + + 4y HeO [1] A Ni(III) dismutation reaction was also observed in the hydrolysi.s of NaNiO 2 in a basic medium and in a 1 M NIt,C1 medium. An ~-oxyhydroxide with a Ni oxidation state higher than 3 occurred in the absence of oxidants (16). The dissolution reaction in the HC1 medium may take place simultaneously with (7! ions being oxidized b 5Ni(III) according to: + 2(l+x) Lil_xNil+xO 2 + 2(1-x) C1 + 8(1+x) tt -+ --*2(l+x) e '~i e+ + 2(l-xal Li + + (l-x) C1 z + 4 tteO [2] Reactions [1] and [2] are not quantitatively combined. For sample B, and according to the results listed in Table I, the process involves the deinterealation of Ni ions concomitantly with the delithiation. The process can be then formulated as: Ni + 0.04 Ci--+ Li ° ~lNi + 0.17 Li+ + Lio.6a 1 3sea .= 1.16Oz +0.16 Ni "÷ + 0.02 C1 2 [3] The X-ray diffraction patterns of deintercalated samples A1 and B1 were used to study cation distribution in these products by the Rietveld method. Tab]o II lists the parameters values obtained and the R eoeffi.cicmts. For sample A1, the best fitting was achieved by assuming a loss of Liions from tile 3~ sites exclusively during the deintercalation of sanlple A. For sample B1, Li ions were removed from 3a and 3b sites, while nickel was removed fornl 3b as a result of the above mentioned Ni,Li extraction. The occupancy factors derived from thes~ assumptions and the chemical compositions are listed i~ Table II. The refined rhombohedral unit cell parameters ~Rfor A! at~d B1 are more divergent from 60 ° than in the untreated samples A and B. This can account for the differences in the number of reflections shown in the X-ray diffraction patterns in Fig. 1 as 222-200 and 422-920 are coincident for c~R= 60 ° (222 and 440 of the cubic tlnit cell). This change is also consistent with the preferential ion extraction from 3b sites, thereby increasing the rhombohedra! distortion from the limiting cubic structure case, a behaviour which is also observed in electrochemicall5 delithiated LiNiO2 (5). 630 J. MORALES, et al. Vol. 25, No. 5 As a final proof of the chemical delithiation process, we studied the thermal behaviour of the delithiated sample with Li/Ni ratio close to 0.5 {sample A2). After treating this sample at 120°C for 1 h, the XRD pattern of the resulting sample (Fig. 1) showed lines ascribable to a structure with ~= 60 °. In addition, a diffraction line ascribable to the (220) planes was also observed. This line is characteristic of a Pd3m cubic spinel structure, such as that found in the thermal treatment of Li 0.sNiO2 at the same temperature {5 ). Conclusions Li~.~ Nil+ xO 2 can be synthesized over a wide compositional range by changing the O 2 flow-rate used in the process. The non-stoiehiometry of these oxides results in a cation distribution intermediate between LiNiO 2 (all Li atoms in 3b and Ni in 3a sites R3m s.g.) and Li~Nil.xO (statistical distribution of Li and Ni in 3a and 3b sites). A partial dissolution of the solid with C12 evolution is observed by treating the non-stoichiometric oxides with 0.6 M tiC1. Simultaneously to this reaction, a lithium deintercalation process is also observed. The resulting solid features a higher average oxidation state of Ni and a lower Li/Ni ratio and rhombohedral ~ parameter than the starting sample. Cation distribution in deintercalated samples is similar to that found in electrochemically deir, tercalated LiNiO2. Acknowledgement The authors acknowledge financial support from CICYT and PFPI.

The combination of these methods provides useful conclusions concerning the structure, cation distribution and properties of the spinel solid solutions. The LixMn1+xFe22xO4 samples contain Mn(II) and Mn(III) or Mn(III) and Mn(IV) for x < 0.5 or x > 0.5, respectively. With the increase of x the portion of Li ions occupying tetrahedral sites increases and becomes 100% at about x = 4/7. In spite of the preferred occupation of octahedral sites by manganese(III), the experimental results can only be explained by a partial occupation also of tetrahedral sites by Mn(III). An increase of MS with the increase of x (expected for a preferred substitution of magnetic ions in tetrahedral sites by non-magnetic Li ions) is not observed. It should be prevented by the decreasing cooperative coupling effects due to the reduction of the iron content. # 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: A. Ceramics; C. XAFS; C.

In the spinel structure (A)[B2]O4, the oxygenions form a cubic close packed array, in which the A-cations occupy one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites and the Bcations are distributed over one half of the octahedral positions. Since the 1950s attention was focussed on the ferrimagnetic spinel ferrites, because new applications, e.g. radio, television and microwave devices, needed materials with excellent magnetic properties [1]. Up to now, differently substituted ferrimagnetic manganese ferrites and lithium ferrites are used as controllable components in the microwave engineering, such as switches and circulators, and as cores of high-frequency inductors and transformers [2]. Paramagnetic LiMn2O4 and lithium manganese oxide defect spinels [3] as well as Li1+dMn2dO4 (0  d  0.33; spinel structure) — Li2MnO3 (layered rocksalt structure) — composites [4] were investigated intensively in the last decades as promising cathode materials for rechargeable www.elsevier.com/locate/matresbu Materials Research Bulletin 41 (2006) 1530–1542 * Corresponding author.

MnFe2O4 and LiMn2O4 are the end members of the solid solution series LixMn1+xFe22xO4 [i] investigated in this work (Fig. 1). Manganese ferrite is a partially inverse spinel (Mn1lFel)[MnlFe2l]O4 with the space group F41=d ̄32=m where l is the degree of inversion. In LiMn2O4 the Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are randomly distributed over the octahedral sites and the Li+ ions occupy only tetrahedral sites. Lithium ferrite is an inverse spinel; contrarily to LiMn2O4, the lithium ions are located only on the octahedral sites according to the formula (Fe)[Li0.5Fe1.5]O4. Above 755 8C, the Li+ and Fe3+ ions are randomly distributed on the octahedral sites (space group F41=d ̄32=m). Below 735 8C the face centered unit cell becomes primitive due to the 1:3 ordered distribution of the Li+ and Fe3+ ions on the octahedral sites (space group P4332) [5]. So far, only a few investigations have been carried out to study the cation distribution in the spinel-type Li–Mn–Fe oxides. Because of the relations between the cation distribution and the magnetic properties, this knowledge is important from a practical point of view. Petit and Lenglet [6] prepared Li0.50.5xFe2.50.5xMnxO4 (0  x  1) spinel solid solutions [ii] by reaction of mixtures of lithium ferrite and manganese ferrite at 850 8C in a vacuum ampoule. Independently of x, the Li+ ions always occupy the B sites like in (Fe)[Li0.5Fe1.5]O4. Spinels with x  0.2 possess an 1:3 ordering of Li and Fe ions on the B sites and the Mn ions are only tetrahedrally coordinated. However, for x > 0.2 the Mn ions occupy both A and B sites, and a statistical distribution of the cations on the B sites was observed. The same order–disorder behaviour in dependence on x was also reported for the solid solutions Li0.5Fe2.5xMnxO4 [iii] [7], Li10.5xFe2.5xMn22xO4 [iv] [8] andLi10.5xFe1.5x+1Mn1xO4 [v] [9]. In all these cases the lithium ions are distributed over the A and B sites. Bonsdorf et al. [10] have also described the solid solution series Li0.5Fe2.5xMnxO4 [iii]. Contrary to [7] they found that the maximum x value for single phase spinels is x = 1.5 and for x = 0.5 the 1:3 cation order on the B sites is already completely destroyed. The composition with x = 1.5 was characterized by Mo ̈ssbauer spectroscopy as (Li0.5Fe0.4Mn0.1)[Fe0.6Mn1.4]O4 with Li ions only on the A sites of the spinel. Zakharov and Garbanov [11] and Shigemura et al. [12] have investigated sections with a continuous change of the valence state of manganese. In [11] the solid solutions MnFe2O4–LiMnFeO4 [vi] were synthesized in air or oxygen atmosphere at 650–1300 8C. The authors assume that Mn(III) and Mn(IV) as well as Mn(II) exist side by side, e.g. (Li0.16Fe0.63Mn0.21 2+)[Li0.34Fe0.87Mn0.58 3+Mn0.21 4+]O4. According to [12], solid solutions between LiMn2O4 and LiMnFeO4 [vii] can be prepared at 600 8C in air. In these spinels only a small amount of lithium was found on the B sites. From the above, it turns out that: (1) there is an order–disorder transition in solid solution spinels starting from lithium ferrite; (2) the cation distribution is influenced by the preparation conditions; (3) in Mn(II) and Fe(III) containing spinel compounds, the lithium ions have a preference to the B sites; with an increase of the content of Mn(III) and/or Mn(IV), which prefer the B sites, the lithium ions are located more and more on the A sites of the spinel. Based on these conclusions, the main goal of the present work is to determine the cation distribution in LixMn1+xFe22xO4 spinel solid solutions and its correlation with various magnetic properties. According to an earlier publication [13], single phase spinels are formed throughout the whole range 0  x  1, when special conditions of C.

Beside general information concerning the structure and phase composition, the X-ray powder diffraction including Rietveld structure refinement should give also special informations concerning the Li+ ion distribution. XANES studies at the Mn and Fe K-edge should yield information on oxidation numbers of the cations and, in a qualified sense, on the site occupation. 57Fe Mo ̈ssbauer spectroscopy is a suitable method to determine the location of the Fe ions. A combination of these methods should allow useful conclusions concerning the investigated solid solution spinels. Taking into consideration results of other investigations, it should also allow some general conclusions concerning the Li–Fe–Mn–O-system as a whole. 2. Experimental procedure The spinel compounds were obtained by thermal decomposition of freeze-dried formate solutions of appropriate composition as described elsewhere [13]. The experimental conditions for getting single phase spinels are shown in Table 1. For the determination of the average oxidation state the solid samples were dissolved together with a defined quantity of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)26H2O in 50% sulfuric acid. Afterwards the Fe(III) formed by reaction of Mn(III) and/or Mn(IV) with Fe(II) was determined titrimetrically with cerium(IV) sulfate solution and Ferroin as indicator. The phase analysis of the samples after thermal decomposition of the formate precursors was performed with a SIEMENS D5000 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation; 108  2u  808; step scan mode width 0.028; 1 s per step). For quantitative statements the XRD data were collected in the 2u range from 108 up to 1408 in a step scan mode width 0.028 (6.7 s per step). Structure refinement was performed with the program WinPLOTR [14]. The background was interpolated because of a uneven background in the 2u range between 108 and 208. The Pseudo-Voigt function was used as peak shape model, sometimes an absorption factor for better B values. Measurements of the saturation magnetization at 303 and 5 K were performed with a vibrating sample magnetometer (Oxford Instruments) and nickel as a calibration substance. The ac susceptibility was measured in the range of 30–400 8C and the Curie point was extrapolated from the obtained values. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements of the selected samples of the solid solution series LixMn1+xFe22xO4werecarriedoutforbothMnandFeK-edgeatthe beamlineBN3ofthe ElectronStretcherAccelerator (ELSA) at the University of Bonn, equipped with a modified Lemmonier-type double-crystal monochromator with Ge220 crystals [15]. The measurements were performed at 2.3 GeV electron energy in transmission mode. Ionization chambers were filled with air. Details on the experimental setup of this beamline can be found, e.g. in [16]. The energy range of the scan for Mn K-edge XANES measurements was from 6500 to 6700 eV in steps of 0.43 eV and 1000 ms integration time per step. For Fe K-edge XANES measurements the energy interval was from 7078 to 7250 eV with 0.52 eV step size and 1000 ms integration time per step. To extract the spectra, a linear background obtained by linear interpolation between two points in the pre-edge region of each spectrum was subtracted from the spectrum. The resulting XANES spectra were then normalized to 1 at 7200 eV for Fe K-edge data and at 6667 eV for C.

Mn K-edge data. To determine an average chemical shift, the position of the first inflection point was determined and correlated to a linear scale obtained from oxidic reference compounds with well defined formal valency. In order to achieve a more detailed understanding of the sample system, Mn and Fe K-edge XANES spectra for different model compounds have been calculated using the FEFF8 code [17]. The reliability and amount of information which can be derived based on this type of calculation has been established for a broad variety of systems including solid state systems of varying complexity [18–21], nanoscaled systems [16,22,23] and metal-containing Fullerene modifications [24]. It should be mentioned that the code tends to underestimate the intensity of structures at the absorption edge, as discussed in detail in [18]. 57Fe Mo ̈ssbauer spectra were taken with a 57Co:Rh source at 295 and 4.2 K. At 4.2 K spectra were also taken with the absorber in a longitudinal external field of 6 T produced by a superconducting solenoid. The source was always at the same temperature as the absorber. For the measurement in the applied magnetic field the source was at a position where the field of the solenoid was negligibly small. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Valence distribution and model selection, Rietveld refinement A continuous series of single phase solid solution spinels LixMn1+xFe22xO4 throughout the range 0  x  1 was synthesized. The experimental conditions are listed in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of several samples with different compositions. All the diffraction patterns can be indexed in the cubic space group F41=d ̄32=m. There are two different models to describe the cation distribution. According to [11] and taking into account the valence distribution of the end members of the solid solution series (Mn2+)[Fe2]O4 and (Li)[Mn3+Mn4+]O4, a hypothetical model with Mn(III) and Mn(IV) ions in octahedral sites and Mn(II) ions in tetrahedral sites could be chosen. The general chemical formula for this model would be Lix +Mn1x 2+Mnx 3+Mnx 4+Fe22x 3+O4. In the second model, the average oxidation state of the manganese ions is obtained with contributions from only two different Mn ions according to Lix +Mn12x 2+Mn3x 3+Fe22x 3+O4 for x  0.5 and Lix +Mn2x 3+Mn2x1 4+Fe22x 3+O4 for 0.5  x  1. For both assumptions of the second model the Li ions can be: (a) distributed randomly over the A and B sites or (b) located on the A sites only. From the XANES measurements (see below) one finds that the spinel solid solutions contain Mn(II) and Mn(III) or Mn(III) and Mn(IV) only and the iron is mostly trivalent. The Mo ̈ssbauer data also show that the iron is trivalent only. This is a proof for the second model. The values of saturation magnetization MS (Table 1) of the samples with a small degree of substitution allow the conclusion that lithium ions occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites (a). In case (b), for low degrees of substitution the MS-values should increase with increasing lithium content in analogy to the well-known behaviour of manganese zinc ferrites [25]. A further indication for case (a) is the weak intensity of the (1 1 1)-diffraction peak for the samples C. Wende et al. / Materials Research Bulletin 41 (2006) 1530–1542 1533 Fig. 2. XRD patterns of LixMn1+xFe22xO4; for sample numbers and synthesis conditions, c.f. Table 1. with x = 0, . . ., 3/7. A strong increase of the (1 1 1)-intensity and a decrease of the (2 2 0)-intensity especially for x  0.5 indicate an increasing occupation of A sites by Li ions with an increase of x and perhaps a change in the general distribution of lithium ions at x values of about 0.5 to a strongly preferred occupation of only the A sites (Fig. 2). The same can be seen from the similar MS values of samples with a middle degree of substitution. The experimental MS values are the result of two competing effects: an increase of MS with x because of a cation distribution according to (b) and a decrease of MS because of the decrease of cooperative coupling. The structure refinement by the Rietveld method was carried out for the whole range of the investigated solid solutions. The above-mentioned second model was chosen to determine the cation distribution over the octahedral (16d) and tetrahedral (8a) sites. For the calculation the well-known preference of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) to occupy octahedral sites and an occupation of tetrahedral holes by Mn(II) were assumed. Because of the good agreement between the calculated and the experimentally determined average valence states of manganese, the portions of manganese ions with different oxidation states were calculated from the theoretical average valence state. Together with the results concerning the Li occupation given above it seems to be possible that the true situation can roughly be described by the first case (a) for x  0.5 and by the second mentioned cation distribution (b) for x > 0.5: for x  0.5 (a): (LixD +Mn12x 2+Fex+D 3+)[LiD +Mn3x 3+Fe23xD 3+]O4 with 0 < D < x, and for x > 0.5 (b): (Lix +Fe1x 3+)[Mn2x 3+Mn2x1 4+Fe1x 3+]O4. Fig. 3 shows the observed, calculated and difference profiles for one member of the series (x = 2/7). Table 2 gives the structural and cell parameters, the cation distribution, the thermal parameter as well as few final R factors and the goodness of fit, S2, for the whole range of the solid solutions. The results given in Table 2 take into account that no exact conclusions concerning the site occupation of Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV) and Fe(III) ions can be drawn from the XRD pattern and the refinement results. As a tetravalent ion, Mn(IV) should occupy only octahedral sites. This is taken into account in Table 2. Further information concerning the site occupation by Mn(II), Mn(III) and Fe(III) ions can be obtained by the Mo ̈ssbauer and EXAFS experiments (see below). The Rietveld refinement only allows clear conclusions concerning the distribution of Li+ ions over octahedral and tetrahedral sites. One sees that with an increase of the amount of Mn(III) the lithium ion fraction on the tetrahedral sites is increased. That means that the Mn(III) ions move lithium from the B to the A sites. At degrees of substitution >3/7, practically all the lithium ions occupy tetrahedral sites. For samples with x  4/7 the final R values and the square of the goodness of fit, S2, are increased already for small portions of Li ions on octahedral sites. The compound with x = 5/7 seems to be an exception. It shows better R factors for a small amount of lithium on the octahedral sites, which would agree with the results of [12] for LiMn1+xFe1xO4 solid solutions. But the generally worse agreement factors and the higher deviation in the lattice parameter indicate that in this case two similar spinel phases with slightly different C.

According to [13] the reaction seems to succeed only in a very narrow p(O2)–T–area and at the chosen conditions are at best near the required ones. One observes that with increasing lithium content the lattice constant decreases and the oxygen parameter (x, y, z) tends to increase. This is particularly obvious if Mn(II) is replaced completely by Mn(III) and Mn(IV). It can be explained by an increasing occupation of the tetrahedral A sites by the lithium ions with a relatively large ionic radius and a small charge-to-radius ratio. The increase of the oxygen parameter is caused by an enlargement of the tetrahedral holes and, with that, an increase of the A–O distance. This compensates the decrease of the A–O distance with the observed decrease of the lattice constant a. Besides, a gradual increase of the thermal parameter B for the A sites is observed. It can also be explained by the increase of the lithium ion occupation. According to [26], the influence of the lithium ions on the B sites is substantially smaller. Firstofall, the preferred occupation of A sitesbylithium ions inpresenceofa relatively large amount ofFe3+ionsonB sites is surprising. But, the site occupation in spinels is the result of some different and contrary influences. One might expect that, analogously to the inverse spinel LiFe5O8, the smaller Fe3+ ions prefer to occupy the smaller tetrahedral sites andtherelativelylargeLi+ionspreferthelargeroctahedralsites.But,the electronicconfigurationofLi+ismorefavorable for tetrahedral bonding to the oxygen ions and the electrostatic Madelung energy of the spinel lattice favours the occupationofoctahedralsitesbyionswithhigher positive charge.Withanoxygenparameterlargerthanthe idealvalueof 0.25, this ‘‘normal arrangement’’ of the metal ions will be energetically even more favourable. Because of the comparatively large Mn2+ ions, the oxygen parameter of manganese ferrite is already larger than the ideal value.

XANES results Fig. 4a displays the Mn K-edge XANES spectra for selected members of the solid solution series LixMn1+xFe22xO4 as well as for a series on Mn oxides used as reference compounds. One can clearly see from Fig. 4a that the main edge positions (determined as discussed in the experimental section) of the samples under investigation are shifted relative to each other. To correlate this shift to a shift in formal valency, the edge shifts of reference oxides MnO, Mn2O3, and MnO2 with the corresponding valencies 2+, 3+, and 4+ were fit with a linear model, as displayed in Fig. 5a. The valences of the spinel oxides were determined from their edge shifts using this curve as calibration. The values obtained in this way agree well with the theoretical values and the results of the wet chemical analysis, as shown in Table 1. A similar analysis is possible for the Fe K-edge data shown in Fig. 4b. Using the same approach for the assignment of an averaged formal valency, one obtains the results displayed in Fig. 5b, indicating clearly that the obtained value is close to three in all cases. A more detailed comparison of the Mn Kedge spectral features of the reference oxides and the obtained data for the samples provides some additional information on the charge distribution. It is, for instance, possible to exclude that Mn4+ contributes in samples 3 and 4 (sample number see Table 1), because in their spectra no peak contributions in the white line region of the Mn4+ reference MnO2 are found. Additionally, the shape resonance located at about 6575 eVin the MnO2 reference spectrum, which creates a second maximum, does not lead to a clear maximum at this position in the spectra of samples 3 and 4. In contrast to that, both features are developed strongly in sample 8 and slightly in sample 6. Conversely, it is quite evident for sample 8 that the onset of absorption does not agree to the energy position which corresponds to the presence of Mn2+ as defined by the MnO reference, and the respective white line position of the reference does not match the position observed for sample 8. Whereas the onset of absorption cannot exclude the presence of Mn2+ in sample 6, the notable reduction of intensity as well as the energy shift in the white line region seems to suggest that Mn2+ is not present or at least strongly suppressed in this sample. Consequently, a fingerprint comparison suggests that only two valencies of Mn, 2+/3+ and 3+/4+, respectively, occur simultaneously in these samples, indicating that the second model discussed above is correct. In contrast to the situation at the Mn K-edge, the identical approach at the Fe K-edge yields significantly less additional information. Clearly, the onset of absorption of the Fe3O4 reference is at lower energies than the one observed for any of the samples. Just as clearly, the energy position of the shape resonance at 7150 eV corresponds exactly with the one found in the Fe3+ reference. Consequently, all samples should contain exclusively Fe3+. However, the rich structural features of the spectra allow for an even more detailed description of the site occupation encountered in the solid solution samples than the mere determination of an average formal valency of the absorbing element and how this can be realized in terms of valence distribution. Returning to Fig. 4a, one observes that C. Wende et al. / Materials Research Bulletin 41 (2006) 1530–1542 1536 the general structure of the Mn K-edge spectra is equal for all samples under investigation—it shows five characteristic features: a pre-edge structure A, two shoulders B and C in the rising absorption edge, a pronounced maximum D and a strong shape resonance E. Both the intensity and the exact energy position of these features vary individually as a function of Li and Mn site occupation and Li content. The electronic structure observed at the Fe K-edge is quite similar to the case of the Mn spectra: a pre-edge structure A, two shoulders B and C in the rising edge and the pronounced white line D, but in contrast to the data, two shape resonances E and F are observed. The most significant change observed in the structures at the Fe K-edge is a shift of the white line position towards higher energy with higher Li-content. In order to correlate the observed spectral changes to the variations in site occupation for the individual samples, FEFF8 [17] calculations have been performed on different model structures in the Fd ̄3m space group, simulating the effects of complete Li substitution on the octahedral and tetrahedral cation sites on the XANES spectra of Fe and Mn atoms on tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively. This approach exaggerates the effects encountered in the actual system, making it well suited to illustrate the specific trends for different substitutions in the lattice most clearly, but unsuited for the exact reproduction of the spectra. It should also be noted that the massive substitutions naturally influence the position of the Fermi level in the model systems, therefore a stringent interpretation of the intensity and energy position of the pre-edge feature based on the model calculations has not been performed. Results of these model calculations are displayed in Fig. 6 and allow to investigate the spectral changes induced by three effects: The site distribution of the absorbing Fe and/or Mn atoms as well as both total Li content and Li site distribution.

On octahedral sites, the white line intensity is much higher than on tetrahedral ones. In contrast to that, tetrahedral sites show more structured pre-edge features, especially more intense structures B and C on the rising absorption edge and a splitting of the white line. In general, the addition of Li leads to a shift of the white line to higher energy (c.f. Fig. 6b and c) for absorber atoms located on either site. This observation meets the general expectation, as Li can only donate one charge and consequently the surrounding oxygen atoms reduce the electron population at the absorber metal sites more strongly. Analyzing the case for the absorbing atom on a tetrahedral site in more detail (c.f. Fig. 6b), one finds a more pronounced change of the position of the entire white line if the Li occupies the smaller tetrahedral site with a partially covalent character of the Li–O bonds. Instead, when Li is occupying the larger octahedral sites only, all energy positions remain nearly stationary, but the intensity of pre-edge peak A, the shoulder B and the (experimentally not resolved) post-white line structure changes notably. Tentatively, these changes can be correlated to the significantly smaller overlap of Li and O orbitals for Li on octahedral sites and the more ionic character of these Li–O bonds. This leads to some reconfigurations of the neighbouring Mn–O bonds, which is visible in the slightly changed intensity of the described absorption features. For absorber atoms on octahedral sites (Fig. 6c), in general much smaller effects are observed, although the trend of a shift to higher energies is conserved, e.g. when analysing the onset of the absorption edge. The reduction of the drastic difference between Li on tetrahedral and octahedral sites in this case is tentatively assigned to the fact that the larger coordination number of the octahedral site leads to an increased stabilization of the electronic structure of the absorber atom.

(b) Calculation of average oxidation states (Fen+): sample 4 (+2.89) (A), sample 6 (+2.96) (B), sample 3 (+2.98) (C) and sample 8 (+3.00) (D). Using these results, it is possible to interpret the changes in the Mn K-edge XANES spectra in terms of the proposed site occupation. The systematic reduction of intensity of structure B observed in samples 4, 6 and 8 clearly reflects the reduction of the relative amount on Mn on tetrahedral sites. At the same time, the notable contrast between the change in intensity for structures B and the smaller change in intensity observed for structure C when comparing the spectra of samples 3 and 4, respectively, confirms nicely the predicted preferred Li-occupation of the tetrahedral site in sample 4, as this should effect an increase of intensity of structure C for the remaining Mn atoms on tetrahedral sites. Also, the calculations verify the observed trend that the energy position of the white line is a function of Licontent. At the Fe K-edge, the decreasing white line intensity of the spectra apparently reflects the reduction of the relative overhead of Fe located on octahedral sites. At the same time, the shift on the position of the white line can be related to an increasing amount of Li on tetrahedral sites, which is also suited to explain the reduction of the intensity of the shape resonances at about 7140 and 7148 eV, respectively. 3.3. Mo ̈ssbauer spectra The Mo ̈ssbauer spectra confirm that all the iron in all samples is trivalent. The relative distribution of Fe over A and B sites was determined from the area ratio of the sextets due to Fe on A and B sites in the Mo ̈ssbauer spectra taken at 4.2 K in an external magnetic field of 6 T (Fig. 7b), where the A and B sites are clearly distinguishable since for the A sites the external field is parallel to the hyperfine field, while the two fields are antiparallel for the B sites. The results are summarized in Table 3. Taking into account the results of the Rietveld refinements (Li+ ion distribution, see Table 2) and chemical analyses as well as XANES-investigations (average oxidation number of manganese and iron C.

Corresponding with the results of the FEFF8 calculation of the XANES spectra, the manganese fraction on B sites increases with increasing x. In spite of the preferred occupation of octahedral sites by manganese(III) the experimental results concerning the site occupation by Li and Fe ions can only be explained by a partial occupation also of tetrahedral sites by Mn3+ (x = 3/7, 4/7). On the other hand, there is also a distribution of manganese(II) over A and B sites (x = 2/7, 3/7) with a preference for tetrahedral sites. Besides, some further thermal equilibration of the site occupation, described by the factor d, cannot be excluded. The value of d should be small and depend on the conditions of synthesis. The synthesis of single phase spinels of the given compositions requires synthesis temperatures between 800 and 900 8C and a quick cooling process. Therefore, the experimentally determined site occupation is the equilibrium distribution at the synthesis temperature. This fact should explain the presence of some tetrahedral site Mn(III) in presence of C. Wende et al. / Materials Research Bulletin 41 (2006) 1530–1542 1540 Fig. 7.

Obviously, this distribution is also favoured in comparison with the existence of tetrahedral Mn2+ and octahedral Mn4+ (beside Mn3+) formally formed by a process Mn(tetrahedral) 3+ + Mn(octahedral) 3+ ! Mn(tetrahedral) 2+ + Mn(octahedral) 4+. The latter distribution cannot be excluded by the Mo ̈ssbauer results, but the result of XANES should exclude it. For aqueous systems the coexistence of Mn2+ and MnO2 is well known from Pourbaix diagrams [27]. On the contrary, simple solid manganese oxides only coexist in two neighbouring oxidation numbers of manganese. This can be calculated with thermodynamic data given in [28]. In all probability, this should be current also for manganese containing complex oxides. With increasing manganese and lithium content, the Mo ̈ssbauer spectra of the spinel ferrite samples measured at room temperature (Fig. 7a) show an increasing line broadening of the sextets with increasing x and components at lower hyperfine field values appear. This is due to the presence of progressively more different environments for the Fe ions on A and B sites caused by the replacement of Fe ions by Li and Mn ions with increasing x. The magnetic order in spinel ferrites is caused by a superexchange interaction between magnetic ions on A and B sites via oxygen. The A–B interaction is dominant. As the number of non-magnetic Li ions increases, the number of magnetic neighbours on A and B sites decreases. This results in a decrease of the magnetic A–B interaction and a decrease of the Curie temperature with increasing x. Further decrease in the magnetic interaction is caused by a spin canting especially for the magnetic ions on the B sites. This can be concluded from the non-vanishing second and fifth line in the B subspectrum at 4.2 K in an external magnetic field. The spin canting angle increases with growing x. For the sample with x = 4/7 a spin canting is also observed for the magnetic A ions. 4. Conclusions From the results discussed above, it turns out that the thermal decomposition of homogeneous freeze-dried lithium manganese iron formates, followed by an annealing process with a defined p(O2)–temperature regime is a suitable method for preparing single phase ferrites LixMn1+xFe22xO4 with 0  x  1 at a relatively low temperature. The formation of crystalline phases begins already at about 400 8C, although the development of favourable magnetic properties requires a synthesis temperature between 800 and 900 8C. From the results of the XANES measurements one can conclude that the LixMn1+xFe22xO4 samples contain Mn(II) and Mn(III) or Mn(III) and Mn(IV) for x < 0.5 or x > 0.5, respectively. The average valences of manganese determined from the edge shift of the Mn K-edge XANES spectra agree well with the expected values and the results of the chemical analysis. In spite of the preferred occupation of octahedral sites by manganese(III) the results of the Mo ̈ssbauer investigation can only be explained by a partial occupation also of tetrahedral sites by Mn(III). The distribution is a result of some thermal equilibration at the synthesis temperature. There are no experimental signs for a simultaneous presence of manganese in three different oxidation states as discussed in [11] for the solid solutions MnFe2O4–LiMnFeO4 [vi]. With the increase of x the portion of Li ions occupying tetrahedral sites increases and becomes 100% at about x = 4/7. This result of the XRD investigation can be confirmed by the FEFF8 calculation of the XANES spectra. The calculation allows the interpretation of the changes in the Mn K-edge XANES spectra in terms of the proposed site occupation. An increase of MS with the increase of x (expected for a preferred substitution of magnetic ions in tetrahedral sites by non-magnetic Li ions) is not observed. It should be prevented by the decreasing cooperative coupling effects due to the reduction of the iron content. The increasing influence of spin canting, especially for the magnetic ions on the B sites, correlates with the increasing difference between the experimental and calculated MS values (see Table 1). Generally, it can be concluded from the results given above that the combination of XRD-, XANES-, Mo ̈ssbauerand magnetic investigations can result in useful and manifold informations concerning the structure, cation distribution and properties of spinel ferrites.

A mixture of stoichiometric amounts of LiOH·H2O and manganese() acetate (Li/Mn ratio 0.75) was dissolved under stirring in a small amount of hot water. This precursor material was calcined at 600 °C for 10 h and allowed to cool to ambient temperature in air.9 Phase identification and evaluation of the lattice parameter for the resulting sample were carried out using X-ray and neutron powder diffraction techniques. The X-ray powder data was obtained using a STOE & CIE GmbH STADI position-sensitive detector (PSD) diffractometer with strictly monochromatic Cu-Ka1-radiation in the 2h range 10–90°. Neutron powder diffraction data were collected at the Swedish medium-flux steady-state research reactor R2 in Studsvik. A monochromator system was used involving two parallel copper crystals (220-reflection) to give a wavelength of l=1.47 A ̊ .

For each of the two phases, one scale factor was refined. The lattice parameter and the atomic positional parameter for oxygen were refined for the cubic phase. For each crystallographic site, a displacement parameter was refined. The Mn occupation of the octahedral 16d site was refined, and the Li/Mn ratio constrained to maintain the stoichiometry Li1+xMn2−xO4. Atomic positional parameters and displacement parameters for the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase were fixed to values from Strobel & Lambert-Andron.12 Only the lattice parameters were refined to give: a=4.92(1) A ̊ , b=8.53(1) A ̊ , c=5.01(1) A ̊ , b=109.5(1)°, V=198.21(1) A ̊ 3. Results and discussion The sample had been synthesised with a Li/Mn ratio of 0.75 with the aim of producing a stoichiometric lithium-rich spinel, Li1+xMn2−xO4, x=0.28. Chemical analysis of the resulting powder could confirm a Li/Mn ratio of 0.749(1), but X-ray powder diffraction showed it to contain an impurity phase: monoclinic phase Li2MnO3 (space group: C2/m) (Fig. 2). From a battery-application point of view, Li2MnO3 is a direct source of capacity loss. Lithium extraction from Li2MnO3 is precluded since the manganese ions are already Mn4+ and therefore cannot be further oxidised. The XRD pattern of cubic LiMn2O4 and monoclinic Li2MnO3 resemble one another closely; their structures are closely related, with the c-axis of the monoclinic phase corresponding to the [111]-direction of the cubic phase. The Li1+xMn2−xO4 phase could be refined in the cubic space group Fd3m, with the refined formulation Li1.25Mn1.75O4 (RBragg=5.62% for 241 reflections and 20 variables).

Introduction With help of remarkable development of technologies, demands for portable devices are tremendously increasing. Here, what we must think is Li-ion secondary batteries as power sources are being adopted in these cordless portable devices. How to satisfy the demand? The answer is to supply good power sources that can offer long cycle life, light weight, cheapness and environmental kindness. So, there are several kinds of cathode materials for Li-ion secondary batteries to fulfill the conditions. Among them, spinel-type LiMn2O4 is the best candidate. However, the material has a poor cyclability due mainly to the collective JahnTeller distortion when it cycles below 3 V. A zigzag layered orthorhombic LiMnO2, isomorphic h-NaMnO2, has a theoretical capacity twice that of LiMn2O4. The same as other materials, orthorhombic LiMnO2 (hereafter referred to as o-LiMnO2) had been studied from conventional solid-state reactions (700–1050 jC) [1,2]. Using this method, however, the powder preparation route is also quite complicated, for example, several times calcination and subsequent physical grindings. Moreover, its electrochemical properties are greatly dependent on its crystalline particle size [3]. So, low-temperature soft-chemistry routes were employed to enhance its electrochemical properties.

E-mail address: komaba@iwate-u.ac.jp (S. Komaba). www.elsevier.com/locate/ssi Solid State Ionics 152–153 (2002) 311–318 performances were surely obtained [4,5]. However, there remained one problem unsolved, that is, highcapacity retention upon cycling. Until now, there are a few reports concerning highcapacity maintainable orthorhombic LiMnO2 synthesized by calcination of freeze-dried precursor at 950 jC [6]. In this case, the powder preparation is too difficult, because it needs well-controlled oxygen partial pressure (about PO2=106 atm). This point prompted us to consider a mild preparation route to synthesize the oxide powder, namely, hydrothermal treatment, which is a kind of promising technique for synthesis of lithium transition metal oxide cathodes. Here, for the first time, o-LiMnO2 was synthesized from Mn3O4 by hydrothermal route at 170 jC. 2. Experimental To prepare Mn3O4 as a hydrothermal reaction precursor, manganese hydroxide was oxidized through a mild oxidation route [7]. Details of powder preparation sequence are described in our previous report [8]. Manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn (CH3COO)24H2O, R.G. of Kanto Chemicals) was dissolved in distilled water. Then, the manganese solution (100 ml) was mixed with 10 M potassium hydroxide aqueous solution (50 ml), and the aqueous solution mixture was stirred at 80 jC for 1 day with bubbling O2 gas to promote manganese oxidation, and finally dark brown Mn3O4 powders precipitated on the bottom of reactor. The precipitates were continuously washed with deionized water until pH reaches neutral and dried at 80 jC in air. The prepared Mn3O4 powders (0.2 g) were hydrothermally treated with various concentrations of LiOHH2O (R.G. of Wako) aqueous solution at 170 jC for 4 days in autoclaves. A Teflon beaker was used to avoid any reaction with the vessel. After hydrothermal reaction, the precipitates were washed with deionized water, and the products were dried to remove water at 120 jC in air. To understand structure of the prepared materials, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a Cu Ka radiation of Rigaku Rint 2200 diffractometer. The collected intensity data were analyzed by the Rietveld refinement program, RIETAN 2000 [9]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi, H-800) observation was carried out to check the products. Pieces of the fresh powders were ultrasonically de-agglomerated and dispersed on an amorphous carbon grid supported by a Cu frame for TEM observation. The accelerated voltage of electron beam used was 200 kV. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS, Analyst 300, Perkin Elmer) was employed to analyze chemical composition of the o-LiMnO2. For electrochemical testing in Li cell, working electrodes were fabricated by mixing the prepared o-LiMnO2 powder, graphite, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride in NMP, as described in our previous report [8]. The slurry was pasted on nickel ex-met (1 cm2), and the electrode was dried to evaporate NMP component at 80 jC for 1 day, and then dried again at 120 jC for 4 days in vacuum state. The cell consisted of the oxide cathode as a working electrode and lithium ribbon as a counter electrode was assembled in Ar-filled glove box. The cells filled with 1 M LiClO4 in EC-DEC (1:1, Tomiyama) as electrolyte were charged and discharged between 2.0 and 4.3 VLi/Li + at a current density 0.1 mA cm2 (45 mA g1) at 25 jC. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Oxidation of manganese hydroxide precipitated by potassium hydroxide A precipitate of Mn (OH)2 was formed immediately by mixing 1 M manganese acetate solution and 10 M KOH solution. The oxygen bubbling was employed to oxidize Mn(OH)2 much faster at 80 jC in KOH solution. According to the previous report [7], a reaction at elevated temperature with an excess of hydroxide ions and oxygen gas, where Mn(OH)2 precipitated, is fairly effective to get purer forms of manganese oxides such as MnO2, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4. After washing the precipitates with deionized water until the pH reaches to neutral, Mn3O4 appears as the major phase with no other Mn-containing minor phases being detectable. Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Mn3O4 after autoxidation of Mn(OH)2 at 80 jC. Here, we think possible reaction route as follows: 6MnðOHÞ2 þ O2 ! 2Mn3O4 þ 6H2O ð1Þ S. Komaba et al. / Solid State Ionics 152–153 (2002) 311–318 312 Miller indices (hkl) are given for the spinel-type tetragonal phase with a space group of I41/amd in Fig. 1 [10]. The calculated lattice parameters from the XRD pattern are a= 5.7676 A ̊ , and c= 9.4889 A ̊ , which are well coincident with the JCPDS card [10,11]. 3.2. Hydrothermal treatment of the Mn3O4 To figure out how o-LiMnO2 phase can be formed from Mn3O4 by reacting with LiOH aqueous solution, powder XRDs were taken as a function of LiOH aqueous concentration as a solvent (Fig. 1). TEM observation was accompanied to observe the phase evolution steps directly, as shown in Fig. 2. Selectedarea diffraction (SAD) pattern showed that the Mn3O4 prepared by autoxidation route illustrates a single crystallite particle with cubic shape. Its edges and corners are well developed with sharpness (Fig. 2a). When the concentration was 0.1 M, it seems that no reaction occurred. Its corresponding TEM photo also depicts that there is no significant change in particle shape and size (Fig. 2b). As can be seen in Fig. 1c, the o-LiMnO2 phase marked with open circle begins to appear as a minor phase. TEM picture also showed somehow different particle shapes in Fig. 2c. Some of particles lost their sharpness in their corners, compared with Fig. 2a and b. It is able to think that some parts of the precursor allow lithium ion to be incorporated into the structure during hydrothermal reaction. As the concentration of LiOH increased, the o-LiMnO2 phase appeared more and more. When the concentration was 3 M, the diffraction pattern shows o-LiMnO2 phase as a major phase and Mn3O4 as a minor phase. Corners of particles showed rounded shape (see Fig. 2d and e). When the concentration reached 3.5 M, the XRD pattern revealed that the most of Mn3O4 has been transformed to the layered o-LiMnO2 phase. As confirmed by TEM, corners of particles changed to more rounded shape and their particle size was smaller than precursor Mn3O4, as seen in Fig. 2f. SAD pattern of o-LiMnO2 also suggests that each particle of the prepared oxide by hydrothermal treatment is a single crystal. There is a possible way to explain how the oLiMnO2 phase could be formed from the aqueous solution; partial dissolution of Mn2+ from the Mn3O4 precursor which consists of spinel Mn2+[Mn3+]2O4 (average valence of Mn: 2.67) into the strong basic aqueous LiOH solution with combination of direct incorporation of lithium ions into the tetragonal Mn3O4 structure as the following chemical equation: Mn2þ1⁄2Mn3þ2O4 þ 2Liþ ! 2LiMnO2 þ Mn2þ ð2Þ Only when the concentration of lithium salt in aqueous solution is 3.5 M, the pure o-LiMnO2 phase could be formed, as confirmed by XRD in Fig. 1. That is, the 3.5 M of LiOH aqueous concentration used to the hydrothermal reaction may be enough to dissolve all of Mn2+ in Mn2+[Mn3+]2O4 during hydrothermal reaction. To determine the dissolved manganese ingredient after hydrothermal reaction at 170 jC, the hydrothermally reacted aqueous solution was examined by AAS. According to the AAS results, manganese component was included in the reacted solution as shown Fig. 1. XRD patterns indicating phase evolution from Mn3O4 to o-LiMnO2 by hydrothermal reaction between Mn3O4 and various concentrations of LiOH aqueous solution at 170 jC for 4 days; (a) as-prepared Mn3O4, (b) 0.1, (c) 1, (d) 2, (e) 3 and (f) 3.5 M. S. Komaba et al. / Solid State Ionics 152–153 (2002) 311–318 313 in Fig. 3. The dissolved Mn2+ in LiOH aqueous solution increased monotonously, meaning progressive phase formation of o-LiMnO2 as mentioned in Figs. 1 and 2. It is most likely that the Mn2+ in Mn2+[Mn3+]2O4 was mostly dissolved in 3.5 M of LiOH aqueous solution, because the value 31% in Fig. 2.

S. Komaba et al. / Solid State Ionics 152–153 (2002) 311–318 314 (dissolved Mn)/(total Mn in the Mn3O4) coincides well with the theoretical value of 33% of Mn2+ in Mn2+[Mn3+]2O4. So, we believe that the most appropriate concentration of lithium aqueous solution to prepare o-LiMnO2 is 3.5 M. Thus, the layered orthorhombic phase could be readily formed by the selective dissolution of Mn2+ from the spinel-type precursor Mn2+[Mn3+]2O4 by the hydrothermal treatment without any oxidant at low temperature as low as 170 jC. The Rietveld refinement was performed to assess the crystal structure of the prepared o-LiMnO2 oxide. The space group of Pmnm was chosen as the best structural model. The resulting Rietveld refinement pattern and crystallographic parameters are given in Fig. 3. Variation in dissolved Mn ratio in LiOH aqueous solution after hydrothermal reaction.

Croguennec et al. [12,13] have pointed out that the stacking fault causes the (110) peak broadening around 25j in 2h in XRD pattern. This asymmetry could be ascribed to the strong widening of the (110), (111) and (210) planes with particular [12]. The broadening of the peaks indicates a degree of disorder in the o-LiMnO2 structure. As confirmed by the Rietveld analysis, o-LiMnO2 has a well-ordered orthorhombic crystallinity. Therefore, it can be thought that this new hydrothermal condition is a very effective approach to synthesize high-quality o-LiMnO2. Neutron diffraction studies are in progress to understand the crystal structure in more detail. 3.3. Electrochemical properties of o-LiMnO2 Fig. 5a and b shows the charge–discharge curves and cyclability of o-LiMnO2 electrodes at a current Fig. 5.

A simple potential plateau at 3.7 Vappeared in the initial charge curve. A very large capacity loss of about 95 mA h g1 was observed during the first cycling, which has been previously reported by several research groups [6,14]. The polarization between charge and discharge voltages was quite large about 0.13 V. With further cycling, voltage plateaus develop more clearly at around 4 and 2.9 V, as shown in Fig. 5a, which are indications of Li intercalation on different sites, tetrahedral site over 4 V and octahedral site over 3 V into the cycle-induced spinel LiMn2O4 [15]. As shown in Fig. 5a, the spinel phase began to develop during the initial several cycles. The appearance of the 4-V plateaus contributes to increase in capacities. In more detail, the 4-V discharge plateau is gradually divided into two subplateaus, meaning that reordering of Li in the structure toward the cycle-induced spinel is in progress, as cycling goes by. The behavior is remarkably different from conventional spinel LiMn2O4 whose capacity decreases drastically within a few cyclings below the 3-V region. Furthermore, the length of the 4-V plateau is getting longer, while that of the 3-V plateau is simultaneously getting shorter with further cycling. It seems that the present material can be cycled both over 4and 3-V ranges without any significant capacity fading upon cycling, as can be seen in Fig. 5b. The appearance of the 4-V plateaus contributes to increase in capacities. In this way, the obtained capacities increase progressively with further cycling and stabilize after 40 cycles while showing a discharge capacity of about 140 mA h g1, proving the close properties as the o-LiMnO2 synthesized at high temperature from freeze-dried precursor [6]. This means that the electrochemically formed spinel-like phase originated from o-LiMnO2 is more tolerant to cycling than conventional LiMn2O4. We are subsequently developing the Co doping effect in the Mn sites by the hydrothermal method [16] and the emulsion drying synthesis of o-LiMnO2 [17] to enhance the battery performances that will be reported in the near future. 4. Conclusion A low-temperature hydrothermal approach using fine Mn3O4 and aqueous LiOH solution was shown to yield orthorhombic LiMnO2 with well-ordered hNaMnO2 structure at a temperature as low as 170 jC. With increasing LiOH concentration, the most of Mn3O4 has been transformed to the layered o-LiMnO2 phase, accompanied with dissolution of Mn2+ in LiOH aqueous solution during hydrothermal treatment, showing changes in shapes of particles from sharp to rounded corners. SAD pattern of the oLiMnO2 also says that each particle of the prepared oxide by hydrothermal treatment is a single crystalline particle oxide. The cyclability at a long term was excellent with help of appearance of cycle-induced spinel phase, leading to increase in capacity in the 4V region. We believe that orthorhombic LiMnO2 prepared by a new hydrothermal condition is an excellent candidate for the cathode material of coming generation with high capacity to be applied for Li-ion secondary battery.

Structures of Quenched LixMn3-xO4 Spinels Paweł Piszora* Laboratory of Magnetochemistry, Adam Mickiewicz UniVersity, Grunwaldzka 6, PL-60780 Poznan ́, Poland ReceiVed April 27, 2006. ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed July 5, 2006 The pseudo-ternary Li-Mn-O phase diagram at 20 °C has been extended by three new phases. The lithium-deficient orthorhombic phase (Fddd), isostructural with low-temperature LiMn2O4, has for the first time been obtained by the steering of manganese occupancy and valence on tetrahedral sites. The influence of lithium deficiency on the formation of various crystal structures is shown, accompanied by their structural parameters resulting from the Rietveld refinement. Valence of manganese at tetrahedral sites has been proven as playing a key role in the phase transitions of the lithium-deficient lithiummanganese oxides. Introduction Temperature phase transitions of lithium-manganese spinel have been studied very intensively in the past decade. Yamada and Tanaka1 have reported the phase transition at a temperature close to room temperature, and since that moment the low-temperature phase has been examined very intensively. Although primarily the room temperature (RT) phase transition had been described as cubic f tetragonal. More precise structural investigations have proved that it is a transition from cubic (Fd3hm) to orthorhombic (Fddd), and the orthorhombic unit-cell is nine times bigger than the cubic one due to the superstructure.2 This phase transition has been considered as one of the reasons for capacity fading of batteries built with LiMn2O4 as an anode material. While the RT phase transition has been well-established, the additional orthorhombic f tetragonal phase transition in the temperature region of 60-100 K has been reported.3 Finally, with the application of very fine experimental resolution of measurements, LiMn2O4 at a temperature of 10 K has been unambiguously identified as orthorhombic.4 Doping of LiMn2O4 with various metals (e.g., Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, Li) has been revealed as a simple method of suppressing the RT phase transition.5 The temperature of phase transition can be decreased by doping, and finally, for a sufficient amount of dopant, the cubic phase is preserved down at 10 K. Nevertheless, for an intermediate composition (e.g., Li1.025Mn1.975O4) the phase transition seems to be cubic f tetragonal rather than cubic f orthorhombic.6 Parallel to low temperature investigations, the structure of lithium-manganese oxides at high temperatures has been investigated, but unfortunately with high divergence of results. For comprehensive comparison, see ref 7. Broadly speaking, LiMn2O4 has proven to be thermally unstable and during heating usually has decomposed to LixMn3-xO4 and additional oxides. At as a low temperature as 450 °C, the thermal decomposition can be observed. This decomposition leads to the spinel phase, with the most probable formula of LiMn2-εO4, where the manganese valence is >3.5, and to Mn2O3 as an additional phase.7 Further heating results in the solid-state reaction between the spinel and the nonspinel phases, creating LiMn2O4 again. While the temperature of phase transition in lithiummanganese oxide depends strictly on the cation distribution and on the valence of manganese, the key to understanding the appearance and the nature of phase transition is the detailed knowledge about sample preparation and measurement conditions. The sintering process at a temperature of 300-700 °C and/or height partial pressure of oxygen direct the synthesis to products with the average oxidation state of Mn higher than in stoichiometric Li+Mn2+3.5O4 and, as a consequence, depress an RT phase transition. At temperatures above 800 °C one can observe the existence of LixMn3-xO4 with the Mn valence <3.5 and some additional lithiummanganese oxides. Thackeray et al.8 have studied the thermal stability of LiMn2O4. They have observed, at a temperature range of 1113-1273 K, the lithium-rich Li2MnO3 phase in addition to the lithium-deficient lithium-manganese spinel. The high-temperature spinel structure has been described as tetragonal with space group F41/ddm and a distortion c/a > 1 (c/a ) 1.02 at 1073 K). At the temperature above 1233 K, the nonspinel LiMnO2 oxide, with manganese 3+, has replaced Li2MnO3, with manganese 4+. Above 1393 K the LiMnO2 phase has been reincorporated into a hausmannitelike lithium manganese spinel considered as the solid solution between Li+Mn2+3.5O4 and Mn3+2.67O4. Many papers have treated of samples quenched during sintering and subsequently examined in ambient condition * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Phone: +48618291262. Fax: +48618658008.

As has been proven recently,9 the high-temperature structure and the structure of the quenched sample are not always adequate. A deformation of the spinel unit-cell was attributed to the Jahn-Teller distortion. The stoichiometric compound, LiMn2O4, presents a first-order phase transition close to room temperature, but temperature is not the only factor affecting structural changes. The most recent researches show structural phase transition as a result of pressure.10,11 One more reason for structural changes in the lithiummanganese spinel is modulation of the chemical composition. Even a small deficit of lithium can dramatically involve essential changes in the crystal structure. Appearance of unitcell deformation depends on the average manganese valence in octahedral sites, particularly on the molar ratio of Mn3+ ions. The average manganese valence in stoichiometric LiMn2O4 is 3.5. Raising of this value (e.g., by doping) stabilizes the cubic structure even below RT. Decreasing of Mn valence leads to the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect and lowers the symmetry of crystals. These non-cubic structures can be observed in lithium-deficient samples. Experimental Section The series of LixMn3-xO4 (0.85 e x e 1.00) sample was obtained by combining the sol-gel auto-combustion method and the ceramic method. The detailed process can be described as follows. The titrated solution of Mn(NO3)2‚6H2O (99.0% Merck) and the equimolar solution of C6H8O7‚H2O were used as raw materials. An aqueous ammonia solution was slowly added to adjust the pH to ∼7. Then, the stabilized nitrate-citrate sol was poured into a porcelain evaporating dish and slowly heated. Viscosity and color changed as the sol turned into a puffy, porous dry gel. If ignited, the dried gel burned completely to a loose powder. Subsequently, the powder sample was annealed for 2 h at 873 K to obtaine a crystalline single-phase precursor displaying the bixbyite (Ia3) structure. The spinel sample was obtained from Li2CO3 (Merck) and R-Mn2O3 powders, by a solid-state reaction in air at 1043 K for 4 h. Finally the sample was quenched rapidly in the solid CO2. An inductively coupled plasma emission spectrophotometer (ICP) was used to confirm the sample composition. Structural investigations were carried out at the synchrotron beam-line I711 at MAX-Lab with an image foil Huber 670 Guiner camera,12 with a Cryostream cooler (Oxford Cryosystem) and with a furnace for the Huber detector in the high-temperature measurements. The wavelength, λ ) 1.2722 Å, was determined by calibration using NIST silicon standard. The data analysis was performed with GSAS software13 with the graphical user interface EXPGUI.14 Results X-ray powder diffraction data collected at room temperature on series of lithium-deficient samples were analyzed by the Rietveld method (Figure 1). The pseudo-Voigt function for peak profiles was used with coefficients as parametrized by Thompson et a1.,15 asymmetry correction of Finger et a1.,16 and anisotropic peak broadening of Stephens.17 Observed anisotropic microstrain distributions may be caused by composition distributions of the quenched samples. For background fitting, a shifted Chebyshev function was used. Phase Analysis. Collected XRD patterns (Figure 2) can be grouped into four sets with different structures of the major phase: I. In the region of Li content between 1.00 and 0.98 practically the only crystal phase is the cubic phase with the space group Fd3hm. Only small traces of the additional tetragonal phase can be noticed in the pattern of Li0.98Mn2.02O4; nevertheless, for this sample the additional orthorhombic phase considered during refinement significantly improved the R factors. II. Samples with composition from Li0.97Mn2.03O4 to Li0.94Mn2.06O4 reveal the tetragonal “flattened” structure with c/a < 1 and space group F41/ddm. The nonstandard face-centered space group was selected instead of I41/amd to better show the spinel structure deformation. The observable amount of the additional orthorhombic phase decreases in this region with the decrease of lithium content (Figure 3). Two possible explanations of coexistence of the tetragonal phase and of the orthorhombic phase, analogous to the lowtemperature polymorph of LiMn2O4, could be taken into considerations. The first is a temperature gradient inside the sample during quenching process, which can results in small differences in local composition and adequate structural deformations. The other reason could be a disproportionation to the energetically more stable phases. Anyhow, improvement of the crystal homogeneity is essential and needs more studies. III. In the XRD pattern of sample with nominal composition Li0.93Mn2.07O4 the main phase can be identified as orthorhombic with space group Fddd. Two minor phases can be both indexed with the tetragonal F41/ddm space group (9) Piszora, P. J. Alloys Compd. 2005, 401, 34. (10) Piszora, P.; Paszkowicz, W.; Nowicki, W.; Minikayev, R.; Lathe, C.

Quenched LixMn3-xO4 Spinels Chem. Mater., Vol. 18, No. 20, 2006 4803 but have different unit-cell ratios: c/a < 1 and c/a > 1. The superstructure reflections of the orthorhombic phase were very weak and very difficult to localize in this multiphase system, therefore “small” unit-cells (a, b, c = 8 Å) were applied. IV. XRD patterns of samples with the nominal composition from Li0.92Mn2.08O4 to Li0.85Mn2.15O4 showed a significant amount of the crystal phase with the tetragonal structure (space-group F41/ddm) and the “elongated” unit-cell (c/a > 1). Beside the coexistence of tetragonal “flattened” and orthorhombic phases, for lithium content less than 0.92 the increasing amount of the bixbyite phase (R-Mn2O3) can be observed (Figure 3). Due to presence of this residual phase, determination of the real lithium content in the spinel phases could be only semiquantitative. It may be suspected that doping of LixMn3-xO4 (e.g., by zinc atoms) improve a crystalline phase purity. Result of our pretests for Li0.93Zn0.07[Mn2]O4 supported this theory. Remarkable divergence between calculated and observed patterns is a consequence of the multiphase system with remarkable microstructure effects. Detailed profile fitting for each phase was not a simple task because of the significant microstructure effects and the strong peak overlapping. The multiphase character of samples can be a consequence of the quenching process and of the temperature gradient, limited by thermal conductivity of the sample, during its cooling. Despite very fast cooling (∼1 s), the complex composition of the LixMn3-xO4 samples with x less than 0.93 can be attributed to the differences in the relaxation process (Figure 3). An example of the Rietveld profile matching is presented in Figure 1. The inset shows a successful good fitting in the most representative 2Θ region (see Figure 2). The structural parameters obtained from the Rietveld refinement are given in Table 1. The manganese fractional occupancy refined for the tetrahedral site decreases in linear fashion with the lithium content, although this tendency is not so clear for x < 0.93 because of the complicated microstructure effects and the serious overlapping of reflection for the multiphase X-ray patterns. Four compositional regions can be distinguished by means of the c/a axial ratio of the main crystal phase (Figure 4). The orthorhombic phase appears in the region III, separating the flattened tetragonal phase (c/a < 1) and the elongated tetragonal phase (c/a > 1). The c/a axial ratio of the elongated tetragonal phase corresponds well with c/a ) 1.06 obtained for the Li0.91Mn2.09O4 single-crystal grown by a flux method.18 Discussion It is actually not possible to give an exact explanation of this sensitivity of the structure to a chemical composition. The main reason for the structural deformation, undoubtedly, is the Jahn-Teller effect in addition to changes in the orientation and displacement of non-spherical ions. Manganese migrates to the tetrahedral sites and, by the quenching process, the spinel phase can be stabilized. The following three models of the manganese ions distribution can be proposed. Model A: LixMn1-x 3+ [Mn3-2x 3+ Mn2x-1 4+ ]O4. Rietveld refinement gives the fractional occupation of manganese ions at tetrahedral sites (Table 1); nevertheless, X-ray diffraction methods cannot distinguish between Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions. Comparison of the stabilization energy of those ions (Table 2) leads to the conclusion that the global energy minimum of this structure appears for Mn3+ ions at octahedral positions. However, the local energy minimum is possible if Mn3+ ions occupy tetrahedral sites. On the contrary, the Mn2+ ion does not prefer any position in the spinel structure, and it is moved (18) Bjo ̈rk, H.; Dabkowska, H.; Greedan, J. E.; Gustafsson, T.; Thomas, J. O. Acta Crystallogr. C 2001, 57, 331. Figure 2. Section of X-ray diffraction pattern of LixMn3-xO4 in the range of cubic 311, 222, and 400 reflections. Figure 3. Phase composition in function of the nominal x in LixMn3-xO4. 4804 Chem. Mater., Vol. 18, No. 20, 2006 Piszora to the tetrahedral site if it occurs near Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions with the strong preference for octahedral sites. The Mn4+ ion does not move to tetrahedral sites because of its very strong stabilization in the octahedral crystal field. The other problem is the ability of the LixMn3-xO4 spinel oxides to structurally deform. The Mn3+ ions elongate the octahedra in the spinel structure and leads (e.g., in Mn3O4) to an increase in the c unit-cell parameter. A more complicated orientation of elongated octahedra in the low-temperature LiMn2O4 can lead also to flattened structure with the c-axis shorter than a and b. Mn3+ ions on tetrahedral sites can induce tetragonal deformation due to their asymmetric electron configuration (Table 2). The shortening of the c-axis and reducing of symmetry can be forced by the tetrahedrally coordinated Mn3+ ions. Model B: LixMn1-x 2+ [Mn2-x 3+ Mnx 4+]O4. Interestingly, there is one more competitive scenario of the constraint of phase transition. Due to high stabilization of the Mn4+ ion in the octahedral field, the crystal can be stabilized by reduction of manganese in the tetrahedral position to Mn2+ and by increasing the amount of Mn4+ in the octahedral position. This disproportionation suppresses the distortion of the tetrahedron and leads to the tetragonally elongated spinel Table 1.

Mater., Vol. 18, No. 20, 2006 4805 structure, because even in this case the average oxidation state of manganese at octahedral sites is less than 3.5. Therefore the presence of Mn3+ ions on tetrahedral sites can force the elongated octahedrons to an orientation parallel to the xy plane (tetragonally flattened spinel structure), model A; whereas in the structure with Mn2+ ions on tetrahedral sites the Mn3+O6 octahedrons are oriented to the z direction (as in the hausmannite structure), model B (Figure 5). Model C: LixMn1 2(1-x) 2+ Mn1 2(1-x) 3+ [Mn1 2(5-3x) 3+ Mn1 2(3x-1) 4+ ]O4. The orthorhombic structure (space group Fddd) of the lowtemperature LiMn2O4 has five different octahedral positions with partially ordered Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions.2 It is impossible to order an equimolar amount of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions on five crystallographic positions. Nevertheless, if we assume that the orthorhombic structure as the intermediate one between the flattened tetragonal structure and the elongated tetragonal structure, we can suspect a manganese valence of about 2.5 on tetrahedral sites, model C. For such mixed valence and the Li0.93Mn2.07O4 stoichiometry, the average calculated valence is 3.4475 and is very close to 3.4444 calculated for a completely ordered orthorhombic structure (Mn3+ as Mn(1), Mn(2), and Mn(3); Mn4+ as Mn(4) and Mn(5)2) (Figure 6). To the author’s knowledge this is the first time that a lithium-manganese spinel with completely columnary ordering of charge has been observed. The presented results open up new vistas of the controlled electronic crystallization in spinel-type oxides. The intentional modification of the manganese valence state at each of the crystallographic positions in the orthorhombic LixMn3-xO4 can lead to the creation of new sorts of semiconducting materials. Nevertheless, the sintering conditions need to be improve to obtain a single phase sample. The structure of the LixMn3-xO4 samples obtained by the quenching process used to be identified as a high-temperature structure. Nevertheless, at a high final annealing temperature (about 1173 K9 or 1253 K19), the lithium-deficient lithiummanganese oxide retains the cubic structure (Fd3hm). Despite the above, surprisingly, the quenching procedures lead to a lowering of the crystal symmetry. Both the a unit-cell (19) Massarotti, V.; Capsoni, D.; Bini, M.

Concerning the differences between the structure before and after the quenching process and taking into account the results of Rietveld refinement, the two tetragonal and one orthorhombic structure presented, can be located on the isothermal cross section of the Li-Mn-O phase diagram at 20 °C (Figure 7). They lie on the tie line between Mn3O4 and Li4Mn5O12, consisting of spinel type structures with fully occupied anionic and cationic sites. This line separates the areas I and II which represent regions of defect spinel and defect rock salt structure, respectively. Summary and Conclusions The lithium deficient samples, LixMn3-xO4, with as small compositional step as x ) 0.01 have been prepared in a range of 1 g x g 0.85. The detailed phase analyses in this compositional region reveal the existence of three distorted spinel phases: two tetragonal phases with the different c/a axial ratio, both indexed with space group F41/ddm, and one orthorhombic phase with space group Fddd. It is the first time the existence of the orthorhombic phase even above RT has been proved as the intermediate structure between the tetragonally flattened spinel structure (c/a < 1) and the tetragonally elongated spinel structure (c/a > 1). The explanation of phase variation in the lithium-deficient manganese spinel series has been presented based on the lithium content on tetrahedral sites and the valence of manganese ions on both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The amount of tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions seems to play a key role in the structural preferences of lithium-deficient lithium-manganese spinel oxides. Acknowledgment.

Introduction Cubic spinel lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) is an attractive material for cathode over LiCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiCo1/3 Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 in terms of lower cost and lower toxicity [1–3]. The main problem with LiMn2O4 is the capacity fading upon cycling which may become very severe at elevated temperature (440 1C) [4]. In the spinel LiMn2O4, Li occupy tetrahedral 8a sites, Mn ions octahedral 16d sites, and O anions are arranged in 32e cubic close packing. Tetrahedral sites (8a) share faces with vacant octahedral sites (16c), so that the 16d sites form three dimensional vacant channels. In LiMn2O4, Mn exists in Mn4+ ðt3 2ge0 gÞ and Mn3+ ðt3 2ge1 gÞ states. Mn3+ ions are Jahn Teller active. The capacity fading that occurs in LiMn2O4 is due the structural transformation from cubic to tetragonal with cycling. This structural transformation is due to the Mn3+(3d4) [5]. Capacity fading is also caused due to lattice instability [6], manganese dissolution [7], oxidation of the electrolyte [8], formation of oxygen rich spinel and particle disruption [9]. Several studies have been conducted to enhance the cyclic performance of LiMn2O4 at room temperature by the partial substitution of Mn in LiMn2O4 with other a trivalent cations (e.g. Fe, Al, Ni, Cr) or divalent cations (e.g. Zn, Mg), because it reduces the Mn3+ content and stabilizes the cubic structure of the spinel [10–13]. In recent years spinel lithium manganese oxide and the substituted compounds have been prepared mainly by solid-state reactions, pechini process, hydrothermal route and emulsion method [14–16]. However, these processes have several disadvantages, such as in homogeneity, irregular morphology, larger particle size, and requirement of long heating time followed by several regrinding. Sol–gel processing has proved to be a potential method for the synthesis of such high performance functional materials. This method has several advantages such as good control on powder stoichiometry, lower calcination temperature, relatively low processing time and production of submicron sized particle with narrow particle size distribution. It is well known that the electrochemical performance of the electrode is strongly affected by the powder properties, such as the particle morphology, the specific surface area and the powder crystallinity. In the present study, the base compound considered is Li1.03Mn1.97O4 due to its more lithium content while retaining in the same structure as LiMn2O4. Single and double doping by Mg and Fe in the base structure have been considered and the following lithium manganese spinel systems viz. Li1.03MgxMn1.97xO4, Li1.03 FeyMn1.97yO4 and Li1.03MgxFeyMn1.97xyO4 were prepared to ARTICLE IN PRESS Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/physb Physica B 0921-4526/$ see front matter & 2009 Elsevier B.V.

E-mail addresses: asil1fmt@iitr.ernet.in, anj_sil@yahoo.co.uk (A. Sil). Physica B 405 (2010) 649–654 ARTICLE IN PRESS present a comparative study of the physical and electrochemical characteristics of all these systems. The compounds were synthesized by sol–gel process using citric acid as a chelating agent. To the best of authors’ knowledge that synthesis of Li1.03Mn1.97O4 spinel cathode materials codoped with Fe and Mg have not been reported, so far. The physical characterizations and the electrochemical behavior of the materials synthesized have been reported in this article. 2. Experimental procedure The compound oxide powders in the following systems of Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li1.03MgxMn1.97xO4, Li1.03FeyMn1.97yO4 and Li1.03MgxFeyMn1.97xyO4 have been synthesized by sol–gel method using citric acid as a chelating agent. The stoichiometric amount of Li(CH3COO)  2H2O (Thomas Baker, 99%), Mn(CH3COO)2  4H2O (Merck, 99.5%), Mg(CH3COO)2  2H2O (Thomas Baker, 99%) and Fe(NO3)2  9H2O (Qualigens, 98%) have been used as raw materials for the precursor. The ratio of metal ions to citric acid is kept nearly 1.0. The acetates and nitrate were dissolved separately in appropriate quantities of distilled water and the solutions were mixed together. Saturated aqueous solution of citric acid prepared separately was added at a control rate in the solution mixture. A clear transparent sol was formed which was converted to clear viscous gel by continuous stirring while heating at 100–120 1C. The pH of the mixed solution was adjusted to value between 6 and 7 by adding ammonium hydroxide solution. The gel formed was dried at 140 1C for 5–6 h to obtain the precursor compound oxide powder. The powder was then calcined at about 750 1C for 15 h in air. The heating and cooling rates during calcination were maintained 1 1C min1. The structure and phase of the synthesized powders were determined by X-ray powder diffraction analysis using CuKa radiation (l=1.54 ̊A), scanning over a range of 10–901 at the rate of 0.51/min. Stripping of CuKa2 radiation was performed during the analysis. Structure parameters were obtained by using the Rietveld method with the X’Pert High Score Plus software. The reproducibility of the (a) background parameters, (b) scale factors, (c) instrumental effects (particle size broadening and strain broadening), (d) structural parameters, (e) profile parameters, and (f) phase analysis were considered for structural refinement process until the results converged into minimum values. Instrumental broadening U, V and W were determined from the Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern of silicon powder sample (a standard for quantitative analysis in XRD), and the results were used in the refinement of all patterns. The lattice parameters were obtained from the Rietveld analysis. The morphology of the powders was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI QUANTA 200 F). Infrared spectra of the samples were recorded in a Thermonicolet (Anexus) at room temperature on a FTIR 1600 series. The sample powder was ground along with potassium bromide (Aldrich, 99.9%) and the powder mixture was pressed in a die at a load of 10 Ton. Electrode preparation, cell construction, and sealing were carried out in an Ar gas filled glove box (MBRAUN-MB 200G) having oxygen concentration of o1 ppm. Positive electrode was made by mixing 70% active material, 15% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder and 15% acetylene black in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine (NMP) solvent. Mixed slurry diluted in NMP was uniformly spread by using doctor-blade on one side of aluminium foil of known weight and dried at 140 1C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. The foil with dried spread on it was rolled and dried further at 140 1C for 2 h. The mass of the cathode active material was determined from the difference in weight between aluminium foil and the foil with dried powder spread. The electrochemical measurements were carried out by constructing a teflon cell with a small piece of lithium foil as negative electrode. The electrolyte used was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a 1:1 vol% mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate. Polypropylene films were used as separator. The cell was tested at a constant current of 100mA between 3.0 and 4.3 V at 20 1C by using computer controlled system. 3. Result and discussion 3.1. X-ray diffraction analysis Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern of the powder samples with compositions Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 have been performed using X’Pert HighScore Plus software. Fig. 1 shows refined patterns of the calcined powders of the compounds mentioned above. Refinement parameters such as Rexp (expected), Rp (profile), Rwp (weighted profile) and GOF (goodness of fit) are listed in Table 1. Atomic positions and site occupancy factors have Fig. 1. (a) Rietveld refinement plots of Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4. Observed data points are shown as straight line (-) and calculated data points by small circle (J) and difference plots are shown at bottom (b) enlarged view of (4 0 0) peaks. P. Singh et al. / Physica B 405 (2010) 649–654 650 ARTICLE IN PRESS been refined in order to minimize the difference between observed and calculated patterns. The refined structural parameters for all compositions are given in Table 2. All the compositions have single phase cubic spinel structure with space group Fd3m at room temperature. In this structure the Li ions occupy the 8a sites and Mn, substituted ions reside at the 16d sites and O ions are present at 32e sites. Ohzuku et al. suggested that the intensity of (2 2 0) peak (at 2y=301) increases with the increase in site occupancy of the 8a sites [17]. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that substitution of Mn with other transition metal ions such as Fe and Mg has no effect on the intensity of (2 2 0) peak. This can be attributed to the fact that the Fe and Mg does not occupy 8a site and consequently all the Fe and Mg ions have occupied the 16d octahedral sites. Lattice parameters of different compositions are given in Table 1. It can be observed from the various refined lattice parameter values that Fe and Mg have opposite effect. Lattice parameter increases with increase in Fe content, whereas the increase in Mg content reduces the lattice parameter. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (4 0 0) peak is an important factor to estimate the crystallinity of the LiMn2O4 spinel powder [18]. Table 3 presents the FWHM and intensity of the (4 0 0) diffraction peak of the samples in the systems of Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4. The doped samples show smaller FWHM and a higher intensity of the (4 0 0) peak than that of Li1.03Mn1.97O4 sample and it indicates that the Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 samples have larger crystallinity. The FWHM of the peak (4 0 0) for single Mg and doubly doped (Mg and Fe both) samples is lower compared to undoped and Fe doped samples. 3.2. Morphological study The morphology of the synthesized powders has been observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and the micrographs are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the average particle size of the doped samples is slightly larger than that of undoped Li1.03Mn1.97O4 sample. This can be explained due to the fact that in doped sample the growth of the particles is higher than the nucleation rate. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that the particles are nearly spherical in Li1.03Mn1.97O4 compound. Particles of truncated octahedral shape have been observed for Fe and Mg doped samples. In Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 compound, most of the particles have well-defined truncated octahedral shape (truncation occurred on all the edges); however, some particles have octahedral shape truncated only on two edges. It shows evolution of particles shape Table 1 Reitveld refinement results.

This is possible only if the growth rate along the {10 0} is much faster than that of {111} surfaces. The formation of octahedral is due to the lower energy of {111} surface. The particles in all samples are slightly in agglomerated state, as the decrease in the open surface area of the particles lowers their surface energy. Such state of particles is also beneficial for higher packing density leading to higher bulk capacity [19]. 3.3. FTIR study Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 compounds at room temperature. The room temperature spectrum of Li1.03Mn1.97O4 consists mainly of two strong absorption bands at 514 and 617 cm1, which are mainly attributed to the asymmetric stretching modes of MnO6 octahedra [20]. In case of Li1.03 Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, the replacement of Mn by Fe ions results in a red shift of the high wavenumber band, which is due to the higher atomic mass of Fe. The blue shift of the band present at higher wavenumber in Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 is due to the replacement of Fig. 2. FE-SEM micrographs of (a) Li1.03Mn2O4, (b) Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, (c) Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and (d) Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4. Fig. 3.

Singh et al. / Physica B 405 (2010) 649–654 652 ARTICLE IN PRESS the Mn ions by Mg ions, which have lower atomic mass compared to Mn. The composition Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 shows two frequency bands at 511 and 615 cm1, which represent the simultaneous effect of Mg and Fe dopings in the material Li1.03Mn1.97O4. 3.4. Electrochemical properties Fig. 4 shows the charge and discharge capacity curves of Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 samples in a voltage range of 3–4.3V. A voltage step at 4.1 V appears for Li1.03Mn1.97O4 as shown in Fig. 4. Ohzuku et al. [21], however, observed the voltage step at 4.11V in LiMn2O4 and attributed this to the transition from two cubic phases to a single cubic phase. The voltage step reduces due to doping with Fe and Mg, implying the cubic phase stability. The Mg-substituted compound maintains single phase during intercalation and deintercalation of lithium without a subtle voltage change at 4.1 V. It can be seen that the initial discharge capacity of Li1.03Mn1.97O4 is 126 mAh/g which is higher than that of Fe and Mg doped samples. Decrease in capacity of Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 is due to decrease in the Li content which can be extracted. The removal of lithium from the spinel is accompanied by oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+. The variation of discharge capacities in Li/Li1.03Mn1.97O4, Li/ Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, Li/Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and Li/Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1 Mn1.77O4 with increasing number of charge–discharge cycles is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen from the figure that the first discharge capacity of Li1.03Mn1.97O4 is 126 mAh/g, which reduces to 118 mAh/g after 10 cycles. However, first discharge capacity of Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4 is 110 mAh/g which reduces to 109 mAh/g after 10 cycles. The discharge capacity of Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 is lower, the first cycle shows 88 mAh/g, which reduces to 87 mAh/g. Higher capacity retention has been found with Fig. 4. First charge and discharge curves of (a) Li1.03Mn2O4, (b) Li1.03Fe0.2Mn1.77O4, (c) Li1.03Mg0.2Mn1.77O4 and (d) Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4. Fig. 5.

Singh et al. / Physica B 405 (2010) 649–654 653 ARTICLE IN PRESS Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4, the first discharge capacity is 110 mAh/g which reduces to 107 mAh/g after 10 cycles. The lower discharge capacity of doped sample with Li1.03Mn1.97O4 is due to the substitution of Fe3+, Mg2+ into the Mn3+ site resulting in oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+, which increases the stability of cubic spinel, reported also by Li et al. [22]. 4. Conclusions Following conclusions can be drawn from the present study: 1. XRD analyses show that the materials of all the compositions studied have a phase pure cubic spinel structure having Fd3m space group. Lattice parameter of the unit cell increases with Fe doping and decreases with Mg doping. 2. Li1.03Mg0.1Fe0.1Mn1.77O4 samples have larger crystallinity than other samples. The FWHM of the peak (4 0 0) for single Mg and doubly doped (Mg and Fe both) samples is lower compared to undoped and Fe doped samples. 3. Average particle sizes in the Fe doped and Mg doped samples are slightly greater than that of undoped Li1.03Mn1.97O4 sample. The particles in all the samples are slightly in agglomerated state. The particles having truncated octahedral shape have been observed for Fe and Mg doped samples. 4. The discharge capacity of Li1.03Mn1.97O4 is about 126 mAh/g. The voltage step corresponding to the two cubic phase transition reduces in Fe and Mg doped samples. 5. Doped compounds show better capacity retention than undoped compound. References [1] G.G.

IIlL Introduction During a study of hydrothermal syntheses in the Li-Mn-0 system, single crystals of LiZMnn’03 were grown (I). This compound is known to crystallize in the Li$3nOi-type structure, an ordered rocksalt superstructure with cationic (I 1 I) planes alternatively occupied by Li and by (LiSn) layers (2). There is some confusion in the literature about the actual cell symmetry of LilMnOi (given as orthorhombic (2) or monoclinic C2/c (3, but cubic and hexagonal forms were also reported (4)). No single-crystal structure refinement has been published. In the LizSnOi structure, tetravalent cations lie in layers (forming a honeycomb planar sublattice for complete (LiM;‘) ordering) separated by 0, Li, and 0 layers. LizMn03 orders antiferromagnetitally at -50 K (.?), as expected for octahedral site d’ ions with edge-sharing between adjacent octahedra (5).

We present in this paper (i) a single-crystal refinement of the LizMnOi structure and (ii) the determination of its magnetic structure below TN by powder neutron diffraction. It will be shown that single crystals belong to a cell symmetry different from all those previously proposed, and that Li-Mn disorder occurs in powders prepared by solid-state reaction. The magnetic structure involves a doubling of the crystallographic cell in the direction perpendicular to the cation layers. Finally, the relationships between the various cells proposed in the rocksalt-related A2B03 compounds are discussed. STRUCTURE OF Li2MnOq 91 Experimental The synthesis of single crystals of Li?MnOJ has been described previously ( f). The crystal used in this study was obtained from a lithium chloride flux. Powder samples for neutron diffraction were prepared by repeated firings of stoichiometric mixtures of lithium carbonate and P-manganese dioxide at 85o”C, with intermittent grindings. A final annealing at 1000°C for 50 hr resulted in a significant narrowing of the Xray diffraction lines of the powdered sample. Preliminary examination using precession photographs were consistent with Jansen’s proposed space group P21c (3). A single crystal of LiZMnOj with dimensions 0.16 x 0.14 x 0.04 mm3 was examined using a computer-controlled EnrafNonius CAD4 X-ray diffractometer at 293 K. AgKu radiation was used with the wscan mode in the range 2 < H < 30” with I .S” scan range. The standard reflections were monitored after every 200 reflections. A total of 2465 reflections were collected over a half-sphere, yielding 6 I9 independent data by averaging equivalent reflections with I > So. No absorption correction was performed. The lattice parameters were obtained by least-squares refinement of the setting angles of 25 reflections with 20 > 20”. using h(AgKcd = 0.515936 A. Powder neutron diffraction spectra were recorded between 4 and 80 K using the DI B high-resolution powder diffractometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin. Grenoble. A neutron wavelength of 2.522 A was used to collect data at 28 intervals of 0.2” in the angular range IO < 20 < 90”. The sample (ca. IS g) was placed in a cylindrical vanadium container of I2 mm diameter. Results and Discussion I. ,Y-Rux Strtrc’trrre Detrrminution Sprtcc~ grorrp und cell purameters. Examination of the data revealed that all reflections indexed in Jansen’s cell obeyed the condition h + k + 1 all odd or all even (this condition is also met in Jansen’s powder diagram (3)). This F-cell was converted into a monoclinic C-cell with halved cell volume using the following transformation matrix (J= Jansen’s, S = Strobel’s cell): Refined cell parameters at 293 K arc (I = 493.7(I), h = 8S3.2(1). c = SO3.0(2) pm, @ = 109.46(3)“, Z = 4.

The manganese atomic positions were determined using the Patterson method. Oxygen and lithium atomic positions were subsequently revealed by Fourier and difference-Fourier maps. All atomic positions were refined with an isotropic full-matrix least squares using the SDP package on a PDP-I 1 computer. Anisotropic thermal parameters of Li I, a very light atom in a special position. could not be refined.

The structure is essentially as proposed from powder work by Jansen and Hoppe (3). These authors, however, did not notice the occurrence of a mirror plane parallel to the NC’ plane in their cell. This mirror results from the stacking of the (Mn?Li) layers. which differs from that in LiSnO? (see Fig. 1).

In conjunction with the C-centered lattice condition hJ = kJ = 2n, this results in (hJ, kr, jJ) all odd or all even, i.e., a face-centered lattice, therefore, the cell transformation to a C-cell of half volume used here (Z = 4). Bond distances and angles (Table II) show that the (Mn?Lil) layers are little distorted. The six Mn-0 distances are equal within 0.8%, and the same applies to Lil-0 distances. Mn4+ ions (ionic radius 53 pm (9)) fit octahedral sites of the close-compact oxide network quite well (theoretical octahedral site radius: 14O(v2 1) = 58 pm). Li-0 bond lengths for Lil (average 205.9 pm) and in the Lionly layer (average 210.2 pm for both Li2 and Li3) are significantly shorter than the sum of ionic radii (216 pm). All coordination octahedra are distorted. Two effects contribute to the distortions: (i) the size difference between Mn4+ and Li’, (ii) the high charge on Mn4+ ions, which occur in cis position in the coordination octahedra of oxide ions. The Mn-Mn repulsion is minimized by large Mn-0-Mn angles (see Fig. 2a). This in turn gives cation coordination polyhedra with small O-M-O angles for the O-O edges shared with neighboring MnOh octahedra (81.6 to 84.4”) (see Fig. lb). Bond distances are more scattered in the Li-only layers than in the (MnzLil) layers. The Li206 octahedron is compressed along the trans 01-01 direction, while the Li306 octahedron includes three different Li-0 distances (see Fig. 2). The /3 angle corresponds within experimental errors to the dihedral angle between faces of the regular octahedron ( 109.47”). 2. Magnetic Structure at 4.2 K Neutron diffraction patterns on annealed powder below TN exhibit magnetic reflections, which can be indexed with a propagation vector k = [OO;], i.e., in a cell with doubled c’ parameter (see Fig. 3). The cell constants at 4.2 K are LI = 492.9(6), h = 850.3(g), c = 1004.0(12) pm, /3 = 109.29(S)“. These features confirm the occurrence of antiferromagnetism with moments of opposite signs at z and z + 1. The value of TN. extrapolated from the temperature variation of magnetic reflection intensities (Fig. 4) is 36.5 f 0.5 K. All magnetic reflections obey the condition h + k = 2n.

From the absence of 001 reflections, only the Fr component is permitted for the F mode. Difficulties in obtaining reasonable values of the Mn atom magnetic moment prompted us to refine the X-ray pattern of the powder used for neutron diffraction work. This X-ray line intensity fitting (II) showed evidence of manganese vacancies on the 4g site. The reliability factors. K,+. are 0.1 I and 0.07 for a 4g site occupation by Mn atoms equal to I and 0.88 k 0.03, respectively. The latter solution corresponds to a MnC4,, vacancy fraction equal to =O. 12. The number of observed intensities is not sufficient to determine accurately a possible distribution of Mn atoms on Li sites. This effect could not be seen so clearly from the neutron spectra. because of the fairly small difference between the Fermi lengths of Li and Mn (-0.3s and -0.22 10” cm, respectively (13)). Partial exchange of 0.12 Mn for Li on octahedral sites is quite possible in such a structure, in view of the similarity in ionic radii between Li’ and 95 STRUCTURE OF LizMnOi ‘“1 “I”‘--2 G 3omG ZooocII oooo-FIG. 3.

The solution Fz corresponds to a ferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in the (MnzLi) planes, with antiparallel stacking of these layers along c. It can be compared to that of CazMn04, another oxide with a layered arrangement of the Mn4+ sublattice (K2NiF4 structure) (8). Both give rise to an antiparallel stacking of the layers along c. In the layers, however, the interactions are found to be of opposite sign. One significant difference in the superexchange paths between the KINiF and LizMnOj structures should be pointed out. The MnOh octahedra share corners in the former and edges in the latter, leading to Mn-0-Mn angles equal to 180 and -9o”, respectively. For di ions, the 90” superexchange angle gives rise to both positive and negative interactions (5). Given the additional difficulty introduced by the manganese vacancies, a comprehensive discussion of these interactions has not been attempted. 3. On the Crystal Chemistry of AzB03 Compounds Numerous AzB03 compounds have been reported in Jansen’s cell (Z = 8), which is typified by LizSnOj, or in an orthorhombic C-centered cell to which it can be reduced when cos pJ = -aJ/3cJ (co = -aJ 3c~) (2). These cells will be referred to hereafter as mC8 and oC24 cells, respectively (where m and o stand for “monoclinic” and “orthorhombic,” and the numerals are equal to Z). The crystal chemistry of AzB03 compounds derived from the rocksalt structure type is actually more complex. Polymorphism has been reported in numerous compounds (see Table 2 in Ref. (15)). Depending on cation ordering and site distortions, the symmetry can vary from cubic to monoclinic. Single-crystal data were available previously for two compounds only, and the published structural refinement yielded rather high R values for both (see Table IV). A survey of compounds reported as “Li2Sn03 type” (with powder Xray patterns indexed in the mC8, oC24, or oC12 cell) shows that, within the accuracy of the data, most of these patterns obey (i) the face-centered condition (h, li, I) all odd or all even, (ii) the metric condition for orthorhombic symmetry cos pJ = -aJ/3cJ, (iii) the metric condition for hexagonal symmetry h/u = d/3 (see Table IV). Lang (2) studied the symmetries resulting from various stackings of the AB? layers along c. The “most probable” stackings correspond to space groups C2/m (Z = 4), P3212 (Z = 6), and C/c (Z = 8). Structural refinements confirm this: for AzBOi compounds synthesized in single-crystal form (i.e.. annealed for long periods in thermodynamic equilibrium conditions), structural studies lead to mC cells with Z = 4 (Li2Zr03, LizMnOi) or Z = 8 (Li2Ti03, LizSn03), with the expected space group. In the case of Li2ZrOj. a recent neutron powder diffraction study (16) gave a C2lc (Z = 4) cell corresponding to a cation distribution different from the Li2SnOi type ([Li,Zr] layers only). The symmetry of powders obviously depend on their preparation conditions, as shown by several examples of polymorphism. For LizMnOj, we noticed that powders annealed at 1000°C showed X-ray and neutron diffraction lines much sharper than those synthesized at =85O”C, but the indexation is identical and consistent with the single-crystal cell mC4 (for monoclinic C-centered with Z = 4) [Cubic and hexagonal polymorphs were prepared by slow decomposition of Li3Mn04 at low temperature (4)]. Moreover, Hodeau et ul. (16) showed that LizSnOi powder contains lithium vacancies.

The latter corresponds to the third stacking case predicted by Lang (2). Corrected parameters (obtained from leastsquare fitting of the literature or JCPDS data) are given in Table IV. The relationships between these various cells are given in Fig. 5. Conclusion The single-crystal structure determination of Li2Mn03 has shown that the actual cell is a Z = 4 cell with C2im space group. The magnetic cell below TN is doubled along c and consists most probably of antiparallel layers of Mn spins along c. The powder used for this determination was slightly disordered. A survey of literature data shows that cationic disorder in rocksalt-type-related structures is commonplace and can provide an explanation for the variety of cell symmetries reported from X-ray powder data.

Several compositions such as Li2MnO3, Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 were synthesized by a sol–gel Pechini method. All the samples were characterized with XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, Tap density and BET analyzer. XRD patterns indicated the presence of monoclinic phase for pristine Li2MnO3 and mixed monoclinic/spinel phases (Li2 − xMn1 − yAlx + yO3 + z) for Al-substituted Li2MnO3 compounds. The Al substitution seems to occur both at Li and Mn sites, which could explain the presence of spinel phase. XPS analysis for Mn 2p orbital reveals a significant decrease in binding energy for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 compounds. Cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also performed. A discharge capacity of 24 mAh g−1 for Li2MnO3, 68 mAh g−1 for Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, 58 mAh g−1 for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and 74 mAh g−1 for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 were obtained. Aluminum substitutions increased the formation of spinel phase which is responsible for cycling. Published by Elsevier B.V. 1. Introduction Lithium ion batteries have gained increased popularity among the scientific community due to their high energy density and long cycle life. Although, lithium-ion batteries are widely commercialized and are more popular for portable units such as cell phones and laptops, there are still limitations and needs improvement [1]. Many efforts have been made to search for new cathode materials that could potentially satisfy the market for high demand portable electronic devices and electric vehicle technology [2–4]. Among the cathode materials investigated, lithium manganese oxides have been exploited due to the abundance of Mn in earth, low toxicity and safety [5]. In this family of oxides, LiMnO2 and LiMn2O4 ∗Corresponding author at: United States Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory, 3610 Collins Ferry Rd., P.O.

Manivannan). showed promising electrochemical properties, such as high discharge capacity and high operating voltage, respectively. However, these materials suffer from serious structural changes after certain number of cycles due to the presence of Mn3+ ion, which is known to be a Jahn–Teller active ion [6]. Side reactions such as 2Mn3+ → Mn4+ + Mn2+, also lead to battery failure upon cycling, as Mn2+ is known to be soluble in non-aqueous electrolytes. Li2MnO3 belongs to the same family of oxide materials having a monoclinic structure with C2/m space group symmetry. The A2BO3 rock-salt type configuration possesses a layered arrangement that can be represented as Li [Li1/3Mn2/3] O2. In other words, in Li2MnO3, 1/3 of the Mn-ions in the transition-metal layer are replaced with Li ions. Layers of lithium ions and alternating layers of manganese ions are separated from one another by layers of cubic-close packed oxygen planes, thus resembling the ideal layered structure of LiCoO2 [7]. The existence of lithium in the transition metal layer provides a high theoretical capacity (460 mAh g−1), which makes it a promising cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Li2MnO3 has been widely studied due to its electrochemical activity in the high voltage region, i.e. >4.5 V vs. Li0/Li+. Its electrochemical behavior has http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mseb.2015.07.006 0921-5107/Published by Elsevier B.V. 14 L. Torres-Castro et al. / Materials Science and Engineering B 201 (2015) 13–22 also been explored by a chemical delithiation process; however this compound has not been well characterized for lithium substitution [8]. The drawback of Li2MnO3 is the presence of Mn in +4 oxidation state, which makes the material electrochemically inactive. Despite, it can be made electrochemically active by extracting lithium and oxygen simultaneously from the structure by chemical or electrochemical means [8]. The activation of Li2MnO3 due to extraction of lithium along with oxygen by chemical treatments with HNO3 and H2SO4 has also been reported [9]. However, during the electrochemical reaction a phase transformation is observed where the new spinel structure is formed [9]. In addition, electrochemical activation has been achieved after exposing the electrode to potentials higher than 4.5 V vs. Li0/Li+, which causes the partial removal of lithium and oxygen from the structure [10]. In both cases, the activation process leads to the rearrangement of ions resulting in vacancies in the host structure, which allow the reversible intercalation of lithium. Recently, researchers have been studying the effects of partially substituted manganese ions with other transition metals such as ruthenium, where a reversible capacity of 210 mAh g−1 was obtained by 40% substitution of manganese [11]. Mori et al. also investigated the effect of Ru doping in Li2MnO3, obtaining a discharge capacity of 192 mAh g−1 for 60% substitution of manganese, while at 80% the capacity was ∼180 mAh g−1. Ruthenium substitution studies demonstrated a noticeable improvement on the electrochemical performance of the cathode material due to the ability of ruthenium to be oxidized [12]. Kim et al. studied the effect of Al, Cr, Zn and Fe doping in the Mn-site of Li2MnO3. They observed that doping small amounts of these transition metals in the structure improved the electrochemical performance dramatically for the first discharge capacity (200–240 mAh g−1) [13]. A different approach reported by Amalraj et al. was the synthesis of nanosized Li2MnO3 to decrease the particle size and increase the surface area, which lead to an increase in capacity of 75% (207 mAh g−1) compared to the micron sized Li2MnO3 (28 mAh g−1) [14]. The same research group performed a study about the relationship between cycling temperature and electrochemical behavior of the electrodes. They established that higher temperatures enhance the electrochemical performance as well as the cycle stability. In order to reduce the initial irreversible loss that Li2MnO3 is known for, Wang et al. coated the surface of the pristine material with FePO4, where an improved capacity and cycle stability was achieved [15]. Instead of substituting Mn site, Dong et al. studied Li site substitution with sodium to partially remove lithium. An improved capacity of 216 mAh g−1 for the initial cycle and 109 mAh g−1 for the 100th cycle was reported [16]. In the present study, we investigated the electrochemical and structural properties of Li2MnO3 at room temperature by partially substituting Li with Al using the sol–gel Pechini method. The substitution in Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 compounds is based on the charge balance where Al has a +3 oxidation state compared to Li with +1 oxidation state. The effect of the Al ion substitution at the Mn and Li sites indicated improved structural and electrochemical behavior compared to the pristine Li2MnO3. 2. Experimental Li2MnO3, Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 were synthesized using the sol–gel Pechini method [17]. For the individual compounds, synthesis was carried out using lithium nitrate [LiNO3 >98%; Luka], manganese nitrate [Mn(NO3)2 50% w/w aq. soln.; Alfa Aesar], aluminum nitrate nonahydrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O 98–102%; Alfa Aesar], ethylene glycol [C2H6O2 >99%; Alfa Aesar] (EG) and citric acid [H3C6H5O7 >99.5%; Alfa Aesar] (CA) as the starting precursors materials. The molar ratio of M:EG:CA used was 1:1.2:1.2, where M is the sum of all metal ions. Stoichiometric ratios of the metals corresponding to each composition were measured and dissolved in deionized water along with CA, which behaves as a chelating reagent. The solution was heated at 80 ◦C for 10 min before adding ethylene glycol to serve as the complex cross-linking reagent. As the water concentration decreased, the solution became a gel-like appearance. The beaker was transferred into a heating mantle kept at a temperature of 130 ◦C, until all the NOx gases released to form a 3D-polymeric structure. The resulting dark grey color powder was placed in an oven at 130 ◦C for 24 h to complete the drying process. The final dried powder was annealed at 750 ◦C for 8 h in air to form the final compound which was bright orange in color. The structural phase identification of the materials and the presence of any crystalline impurities in the compounds were studied with PANalytical X’Pert Powder diffractometer (XRD) using a CuK radiation ( = 1.54056 ̊A). XRD spectra were acquired at 45 kV and 40 mA for a 2 ranging from 10 to 90◦. Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction measurements were performed at POWGEN powder diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The data were collected with a central wavelength of 1.066 ̊A at both 300 K and 10 K. This facility covers a d-spacing range of 0.276–4.606 ̊A. Raman scattering (RS) spectra were recorded using a T6400 spectrometer equipped with a triple grating monochromator and a Coherent Innova 90C Ar laser at 514.5 nm. The morphology of the samples was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) conducted with JEOL 7600 FE-SEM interfaced with a Thermo-Electron S7 X-ray Microanalysis system. System was calibrated using CuK = 8.041 keV. The specific surface area was measured with the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method using an ASAP 2020, Micromeritics. Tap density analysis was performed with an Autotap Quantachrome instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained utilizing a Physical Electronics (PE) SAM-590 UHV system equipped with a PE spherical capacitor type analyzer with an Omni Focus III Lens and a PE 04-303 Ar-ion Gun. Binding energies (BEs) were referenced to adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV [18]. The electrochemical behavior of the as-synthesized materials was examined in a two-electrode CR2032-type coin cell configuration using liquid electrolytes consisting of 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 dissolved in 1:2 (v/v) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The working electrode was fabricated by mixing 80 wt.% of the active material, 10 wt.% of polyvinylidene fluoride binder (PVDF, Alfa Aesar) and 10 wt.% of carbon black (Alfa Aesar) [19]. The slurry was prepared using 1-methyl 2-pyrolidone as the solvent and was coated onto Al foil substrates to form a homogeneous electrode. Li metal foil was used as the counter electrode and Celgard 2400 was used as a separator between anode and cathode. The coin cell was assembled inside the Ar-filled glove box (MBraun, O2 and H2O < 1 ppm). The electrochemical analysis of the coin cells was investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge/discharge process (C/D) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Cyclic voltammetry was performed on the coin cells at a scan speed of 0.1 mV s−1 and a potential range of 2.0–4.8 V with a Solartron Analytical 1470E Cell Test station. The cells were tested using a constant current method (C/D) of 0.05 C (10 mA g−1) with a potential window ranging from 2.8 to 4.8 V on an Arbin 60 channels battery tester. The impedance was measured using the ac voltage of 5 mV over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz using a Solartron Analytical 1252A Frequency Response Analyzer. L.

Results and discussion 3.1. X-ray diffraction: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for Li2MnO3, Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 compounds synthesized by a sol–gel Pechini method are shown in Fig. 1. The pristine Li2MnO3 diffraction pattern displayed no impurity peaks as demonstrated in Fig. 1a, matching with the PDF# 84-1634. This confirms the presence of a single phase for Li2MnO3 with lattice parameters in agreement with the literature values [14,20–22]. The XRD pattern for Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 (Fig. 1b) showed all the diffraction peaks similar to Li2MnO3. However, some of the peaks were split at the top, which represents a spinel phase in the structure. Fig. 1c presents the XRD profile for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 compound, in which a spinel phase formation is revealed. Fig. 1d shows the XRD pattern for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 compound where the intensities of the characteristic peaks (2 = 20–23◦) of C2/m group symmetry are weak. These characteristic peaks are due to the presence of lithium in the transition metal layers and, identified in the lattice with the Miller indices (h k l) of (0,2,0) and (1,1,0), in which only lithium and oxygen are present in the plane. The intensity of this peak seems to decrease as the amount of aluminum substitution is increased, which could be due to the simultaneous substitution of aluminum into the manganese and lithium sites or loss of lithium during synthesis.

All the compositions contain a spinel phase in addition to the monoclinic phase due to the substitution of aluminum ions. Table 2 shows the lattice parameters for the Al-substituted Li2MnO3 compounds based on the fitting for a spinel phase. As we increase the amount of aluminum substitution, the ‘a’ lattice parameter approaches the value for the spinel phase, demonstrating the influence of aluminum ions towards the formation of a spinel phase. On the other hand, when observing the lattice parameters based on fitting for a monoclinic phase, it seems that the compounds with the lowest substitution of aluminum have similar lattice parameters values as the monoclinic phase. Based on the observations made by XRD analysis we conclude that spinel phase will be more prominent as we increase the amount of Al substitution. 3.2.

The results of the refinements are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. The refinement presented in Fig. 2, shows that the sample is a mixture of two phases: Monoclinic (C2/m) Li2MnO3, and Spinel (Li,Al)(Mn,Al)2O4. We tested mainly four possibilities assigning aluminum to (a) lithium site in the monoclinic phase, (b) manganese site in the monoclinic phase, (c) lithium site in the spinel phase and (d) manganese site in the spinel phase. Out of these four possibilities, the assignment of Al to Mn site in the spinel phase best describes our data. 3.3. Raman scattering: In order to fully understand the effect of Al substitution on the structure of Li2MnO3, Raman spectra were obtained (Fig. 3). The Raman spectra for the pristine Li2MnO3 cathode material, shown in Fig. 3a, exhibits nine resolved peaks at 248, 309, 323, 368, 414, 431, 487, 559 and 607 cm−1, which are in good agreement with those reported by Amalraj et al. [23]. According to their theoretical calculations, the monoclinic Li2MnO3 oxide with C2h3 spectroscopic symmetry is predicted to show 10 Raman-active modes with 4Ag + 6Bg species. The peaks at low wavenumbers are linked to the vibration of the LiO6 octahedral and to the O–Mn–O bending modes (Bg modes), while high wavenumber peaks are related to the stretching modes of the Mn–O bonds (Ag modes) [24–26]. These later vibrations are mostly due to the O–O motions since Mn ions located at the octahedron center do not vibrate in the Raman Ag modes. The Raman spectra of Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 are almost identical to that of the pristine sample, with a slight shift that is within the acceptable range. An additional peak occurs at 654 cm−1 which is attributed to the presence of Al–O bonds. The Raman spectra of Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 (Fig. 3b) display a different profile that indicates different structural arrangement of atoms in the lattice. The spectrum contains seven bands at 350, 394, 431, 479, 540, 605, and 646 cm−1 for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and nine bands at 278, 328, 360, 402, 454, 486, 547, 597 and 630 cm−1 for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3. The substitution of Li with Al induces the presence of an additional phase with a spinel structure. Preudhome and Tarte [27] claimed that if there are two different octahedra in a structure, with different vibrational frequencies, their vibrational interaction is going to be weak resulting in individual contributions to the spectrum at their respective distinctive frequencies. It is the case for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 framework, which contains MnO6 and AlO6 octahedra. Following this thought, the high wavenumber peak of Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 located at 646 cm−1 and 630 cm−1 respectively, is L. Torres-Castro et al. / Materials Science and Engineering B 201 (2015) 13–22 17 Fig. 3. Raman scattering spectra of (a) Li2MnO3, Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 and (b) Li1.0Al0.33MnO3, Li0.5Al0.5MnO3. due to the stretching modes of the Al–O bonds (A1g mode), while the low wavenumber peaks at 540, 479, 431, 394 and 350 cm−1 for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and 547, 486, 454, 402, 360, 328 and 278 cm−1 for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 have the T2g character for the (Mn, Al)–O bond vibrations. 3.4. SEM and EDX: The powder morphology of the synthesized samples was analyzed with SEM. It is important to determine the particle size of the materials because it is known that electrochemical performance of an electrode is strongly dependent on the particle size. For small particle size, the specific surface area is higher, allowing easy kinetics for insertion/extraction of Li+ ions leading to high energy density. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 4, where the materials synthesized with the sol–gel Pechini method resulted in the formation of agglomerates. It can be observed that the particle size of the pristine Li2MnO3 and Al-substituted compounds are similar and are displaying high agglomeration of the primary particles. EDX analysis performed over the agglomerated area and its surrounding indicates the existence of the respective elements in the compounds. 3.5. BET analysis The BET surface area was measured for the samples using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The surface area for Li2MnO3, Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 (25% Al-substitution), Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 (50% Al-substitution) and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 (75% Al-substitution) were determined to be 2.05, 13.36, 19.92 and 10.87 m2 g−1 respectively as shown in Fig. 5. Amalraj et al. reported a surface area for the pristine Li2MnO3 synthesized by a solid-state route to be 0.86 m2 g−1 [14]. Therefore, the sol–gel Pechini method doubles Fig. 4.

In addition, the BET surface area for Al-substituted samples is significantly higher compared to the pristine Li2MnO3. Tap density analysis was performed for the compounds to complement the BET measurements since high surface area is inversely proportional to the packing density. Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 exhibits a higher tap density and a smaller surface area among the Al-substituted compounds. The combination of both properties suggests that this compound will exhibit a higher energy density and a better cycle stability. 3.6. XPS As mentioned before, the main objective of this work is to reduce the Mn valence state and investigate the electrochemical properties for improved cycling capacity. In order to understand the effects of these Al substitutions on the valence state of Mn, XPS spectra of the materials were performed. The XPS results presented in Fig. 6 indicate that Mn 2p spectra exhibited two major peaks due to the spin-orbit splitting for all compositions. The Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 binding energy values for the pristine Li2MnO3 are 654.10 eV and 642.30 eV, respectively, with a binding energy splitting of 11.8 eV. The XPS data for Mn 2p orbital for the Al-substituted compounds is presented in Table 5.

The change to a lower binding energy is an indication of a reduction in the valence state of manganese (Mn<4+) which could enable this material to cycle with an enhanced capacity. In the case of Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, the peaks are slightly shifted to higher binding energies, indicating no change in the valence state of manganese. The lower binding energy obtained from XPS results for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 compounds suggest we could expect an improvement in the electrochemical performance. 3.7. Electrochemical characterization The electrochemical performance of the cathode materials was investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) to observe the redox processes. The potential window used was 2.0–4.8 V at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Three consecutive CV measurements were performed to understand the redox reaction before and after charge/discharge cycles. The first CV for Li2MnO3, shown in Fig. 7(a), presents the distinctive anodic and cathodic peaks for this material at 3.33 and 2.67 V, respectively. A broader oxidation peak is observed around 4.07 V, which is the evidence for phase transition in the structure from layer to spinel as reported in the literature [28]. After each cyclic voltammetry, the current intensity at the anodic peak was decreasing and the voltage shifted to higher potential values. On the contrary, the cathodic peak current intensity was increasing and moving to lower potentials, which reveal a separation between the anodic and cathodic peaks, indicative of an irreversible process. The CV behavior for the Al-substituted compounds is similar to spinel phase materials as well as monoclinic Li2MnO3, which was expected since spinel phase was observed in both XRD and RAMAN analysis. The oxidation and reduction peaks for the spinel phase materials correspond to the process associated with Mn4+/Mn3+ but in our case the oxidation peaks corresponds to Mn4+/Mn3.5–3.9+ as shown by XPS analysis. In addition, pure spinel phase presents a lower separation of peak potentials compared to our compounds, which indicates the combination of two phases (monoclinic along with spinel) for the Al-substituted Li2MnO3. Cyclic voltammogram of Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 showed a similar behavior to the pristine sample (Fig. 7b). The anodic peak at ∼4.68 V is due to the partial extraction of lithium and oxygen ions from the structure. In the case of Li1.0Al0.33MnO3, (Fig. 7c), two anodic peaks at 3.29 V and 4.17 V were observed. The current intensity of the first anodic peak decreases after each CV, while the voltage remains fairly similar. The second cathodic peak exhibited a shift to lower potential values with a slight increase in current after each cycle indicating the irreversible process during the electrochemical performance. Similarly, the first CV for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 (Fig. 7d) depicts well-defined anodic and cathodic peaks. The intensities of the oxidation and reduction peaks are higher and sharper than pristine Li2MnO3. The second CV exhibited a reduction in the voltage for the first anodic peak from 3.15 V to 3.07 V, while the current increased to 0.51 mA from 0.44 mA. In addition, the second anodic peak at 4.28 V confirms the presence of spinel phase in the structure, as observed in XRD and Raman. In the case of the peak around 2.61 V, a small change in voltage and current is observed after the first CV. L.

The charge–discharge curves for pristine and Al-substituted Li2MnO3 are shown in Fig. 8. The current density used was 10 mA g−1 for a potential window of 2.8–4.8 V. Table 6 presents the first charge and discharge capacity of the compounds as well as the coulombic efficiency of the 1st and 50th cycle. First galvanostatic charge/discharge profile for Li2MnO3 shows a plateau at 4.5 V (Fig. 8a) that is related to lithium and oxygen extraction from the structure [29]. The specific capacity after charging was calculated to be 32 mA g−1, with a corresponding discharge capacity of 12 mAh g−1. The coulombic efficiency of the first cycle for pristine Li2MnO3 was 38% but it improved for consecutive cycles. At 50th cycle, the capacity was approximately 24 mAh g−1 with an efficiency of 90%. These results were expected since monoclinic phase compounds are known for its lack of electrochemical activities during redox process. Fig. 8b exhibits the charge/discharge profile of Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 which displays a similar electrochemical behavior as Li2MnO3, showing higher first cycle discharge capacity of 68 mAh g−1 with an efficiency of 62%. After 50 cycles the capacity was around 58–55 mAh g−1 and continued to decrease after each cycle. A plateau at ∼4.65 V is also observed for this compound, which refers to the extraction of lithium and oxygen from the host structure. Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 showed an initial discharge capacity of 58 mAh g−1, however, this compound demonstrated the best cycle stability with a discharge capacity in the range of 60–62 mAh g−1 (Fig. 8c) and coulombic efficiency of ∼99%. Charge–discharge curves for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 are shown in Fig. 8d and the initial discharge capacity exhibited 81% efficiency (74 mAh g−1) compared to pristine Li2MnO3 (20 mAh g−1). After 50 cycles, the capacity was ∼70 mAh g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 99%. The enhance electrochemical performance for the Al-substituted compounds is related to the ability of aluminum to occupy manganese site and lithium site simultaneously, which force the valance state of manganese to decrease in order to balance the charge as shown from XPS results. Fig. 9 shows a comparison of discharge capacity vs. number of cycles for all the cathode materials studied. Pristine Li2MnO3 initial discharge capacity was 12 mAh g−1 which was increasing for the first 25 cycles and eventually stabilized at a discharge capacity of ∼24 mAh g−1. The capacity behavior at the initial cycles is due to the cell formation in the coin cell and the capability of the electrolyte to get good contact with the electrode [30]. Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 presents high capacity and good cycle stability compared to Al-substituted compounds and Li2MnO3. This improvement of the electrochemical performance is attributed to the insertion of aluminum ions into lithium and manganese sites simultaneously, which manage to decrease the valance state of manganese from 4+ to 3.5–3.8+. The cycle performance of Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 and Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 is presenting a slight disorder at the beginning of the charge/discharge 20 L.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on all the samples in order to monitor the cell resistance during charge/discharge cycles. The results for the pristine Li2MnO3 and Al -substituted materials are shown in Fig. 10 in the form of Nyquist plots. Fig. 10a shows the EIS measurements for the compounds before cycling. The initial resistance (RI) of the coin cells and the charge transfer resistance (RCT) are listed in Table 7. Li2MnO3 exhibited high initial resistance before cycling. However, the resistance decreased for consecutive cycles. A similar behavior was observed for Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, where the initial resistance was high but decreased after cycling. The initial resistance for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 before cycling was RI = 5.34  and increase to RI = 10.54  after three cycles. The same phenomena occur for Li1.0Al0.33MnO3, where the initial resistance increased after each cycle. In addition, we analyzed the charge transfer resistance for the compounds before cycling and after three cycles. The charge transfer resistance for the Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 compound (RCT = 30.14 ) is smaller than Li2MnO3 (RCT = 1164 ), Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 (RCT = 603 ), and Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 (RCT = 1316 ), indicating that this composition facilitates electron transport at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte compared to the others samples. Detailed EIS measurements are needed to understand the slow charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. 4. Conclusions Li2MnO3, Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 were successfully synthesized by a sol–gel Pechini method. The compounds were characterized with XRD, where single phase was observed for the pristine Li2MnO3. The XRD profile for Li1.5Al0.17MnO3, Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 and Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 indicated the presence of monoclinic/spinel phases, which was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy analysis and Neutron diffraction analysis. The spinel phase seems to form with increased aluminum substitution in the structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Mn 2p orbital showed a decrease in binding energy for Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 and Li1.0Al0.33MnO3, while the change in binding energy for Li1.5Al0.17MnO3 was not significant. The shift to a lower binding energy for the samples indicates a decrease in the oxidation state of Mn, leading to a better electrochemical performance. These interpretations were supported by charge/discharge study at a current density of 10 mA g−1, were an increase in capacity and better stability was observed for the Li0.5Al0.5MnO3 (70 mA g−1) and Li1.0Al0.33MnO3 (62 mA g−1) compounds.

Tabuchi† *Fundamental Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation, 34 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba 305, Japan; and †Material Development Center, NEC Corporation, 4-1-1 Miyazaki, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki 216, Japan Received October 23, 1996; in revised form February 25, 1997; accepted February 27, 1997 The transport and magnetic properties of stoichiometric and Li-rich LiMn2O4 spinels are investigated. Clear anomalies, which are associated with a structural phase transition from cubic to tetragonal, are observed in the temperature dependence of resistivity and susceptibility in the stoichiometric sample. The sharp increase in resistivity with decreasing temperature suggests a transition similar to the Verwey transition seen in the Fe3O4 spinel. Electrical conduction above the transition temperature is well described by a hopping model with an activation energy of about 0.16 eV. Effective paramagnetic moments obtained from Curie constants yield information on the average ionic valence of Mn. The average ionic valences of Mn increase in the Li-rich samples, suggesting that the excess Li ions substitute on the Mn site. A superexchange magnetic interaction between the Mn ions via oxygen atoms is also discussed. The magnetic interaction in a 90°° arrangement of Mn–O–Mn changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic with increasing Mn41/Mn31 ratio. ( 1997 Academic Press INTRODUCTION Lithium manganate spinel, LiMn2O4, is one of the most prominent materials used as cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries (1, 2). In the LiMn2O4 spinel structure, oxygen ions form a cubic-close-packed lattice, and Li and Mn ions are located at tetrahedral (8a) and octahedral (16d) sites, respectively. Electrochemical extraction of Li ions from the tetrahedral site occurs at 4 V, associated with the phase change of LiMn2O4 (average Mn valence, #3.5) to jMnO2 (#4). Insertion of Li into the LiMn2O4 compound, on the other hand, occurs at 3 V, and causes a phase transition to Li2Mn2O4 (#3). These three compounds have spinel-type structures, and thus the structural framework is kept intact by the extraction/insertion process of Li ions. 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed. The reduced Li2Mn2O4 material shows tetragonal symmetry (c/a&1.16) due to the Jahn—Teller distortion of Mn3`O2~ 6 octahedra (1), whereas j-MnO2 has a cubic lattice (c/a"1). Although the LiMn2O4 compound shows cubic symmetry at room temperature, the 50% concentration of Jahn—Teller Mn3` ions is very close to the critical value of the structural transition between tetragonal and cubic lattices. Consequently, decreasing the temperature causes a structural phase transition around 280K (3). A problem to overcome for commercial applications of the LiMn2O4 spinel is poor cyclability of the charge—discharge process in the 4-V region. This should be considered as relating to the lattice instability of LiMn2O4 with the critical concentration of Mn3` ions. Extensive studies on the exploration of high performance (high capacity and reliable cyclability and so on) cathode materials have shed light on nonstoichiometric phases in the vicinity of the stoichiometric composition of LiMn2O4. Recently, Gummow et al. reported that materials synthesized from Li-rich compositions showed significantly improved cyclability in the 4-V region (4). Yamada investigated a series of materials with Li-rich compositions and revealed that a small amount of excess Li suppressed the structural distortion (5). They suspected that the substitution of Li1` ions on the Mn site, i.e., Li(LixMn2~x)O4, increased the average ionic valence of Mn, thus decreasing the number of Jahn—Teller Mn3` ions. This paper describes transport and magnetic properties of stoichiometric and Li-rich LiMn2O4 spinels. Resistivity measurement reveals that phase transition in the stoichiometric sample has similarities to the Verwey transition seen in the Fe3O4 spinel (6, 7). Effective paramagnetic moments obtained from Curie constants provide the average ionic valence of Mn. The result of the increased Mn valence strongly suggests that the excess Li ions substitute on the Mn site in the Li-rich samples. Effects of Li/Mn ratios on the structure and a superexchange-type magnetic interaction are also discussed. 138 0022-4596/97 $25.00 Copyright ( 1997 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. EXPERIMENTAL Stoichiometric and Li-rich LiMn2O4 powder samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction. Mixtures of Li2CO3 and MnO2 (EMD) with Li/Mn ratios (a/2) of 1.00/2.00 (stoichiometric), 1.05/2.00, and 1.10/2.00 were calcined at 400°C for 8 h and then sintered at 750—900°C for 8 h in an oxygen atmosphere with intermediate grindings. The samples were confirmed to be single phase by X-ray diffraction using a conventional h—2h scanning method. Lattice constants were determined by a full-profile fit of X-ray diffraction data using the Rietveld analysis program RIETAN (8). Low temperature X-ray diffraction measurements from 300 to 25 K were carried out to confirm the structural phase transition. Resistivity of the a"1.00 and 1.10 samples was measured by a four-probe method over the temperature range from 220 to 550 K with heating and cooling rates less than 0.5 K/min in 1 atm of air. Rectangular bars with the size of about 3(W)]3(H)]10(L) mm of the polycrystalline samples were used. Magnetic properties were measured with a SQUID magnetometer. The temperature dependence of susceptibility was measured at temperatures decreasing from 380 to 5 K at an applied magnetic field of 5 T. M—H behaviors were also measured at 5 K in a magnetic field ranging from !5 to 5 T. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structures of the samples at 300 K are of the cubic-spinel type with a space group of Fd31 m. Since the sintering temperature is relatively low, the X-ray diffraction peaks show isotropic and anisotropic broadening due to the small particle size and crystal strain. A fullprofile fit using the Rietveld analysis gives precise lattice constants for the phases, and the results are listed in Table 1. The lattice constant decreases with increasing Li concentration a.

With decreasing temperature, the resistivity in the a"1.00 sample increases nearly an order of magnitude at 290 K. This change in resistivity shows a temperature hysteresis of about 12 K, suggesting a first-order transition. In the a"1.10 sample, in contrast, no such anomaly is observed. The temperature dependence of resistivity in the a"1.10 sample shows a monotonic semiconductor-like behavior and is quite similar to the behavior observed in the a"1.00 sample above the transition temperature. A clear anomaly can also be observed in the magnetic measurement. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of susceptibility (s) and inverse susceptibility (1/s) in the a"1.00, 1.05, and 1.10 samples. With careful observation, a slight change in the slope of 1/s in the a"1.00 sample below about 290 K can be noticed. This is obvious in the plot of the derivative for 1/s versus temperature, shown in Fig. 3. An abrupt change in d(1/s)/d1 at 290 K in the stoichiometric sample can be observed. These anomalies in resistivity and susceptibility in the stoichiometric sample should be related to a structural phase transition. X-ray diffraction peaks in Fig. 4 clearly show the phase transition. Bragg peaks of (4 4 0) [2h&44°] and (3 3 3) and (5 1 1) [2h&58°] in the cubic structure are observed in the a"1.00 and 1.10 samples at 300 K. At 250K satellite peaks are seen in the a"1.00 sample, while no significant change is observed in the a"1.10 sample. The same results were first reported by Yamada et al. (3) and they assigned these satellite peaks as originating from a tetragonal phase with a space group of I41/amd. The phase transition temperatures of the stoichiometric sample determined from X-ray diffraction measurements are between FIG. 1. Temperature dependence of resistivity for stoichiometric (a"1.00) and Li-rich (a"1.10) samples. Arrows in the figure indicate the results of changing the temperature.

The results of the Curie—Weiss fit are also shown in (b) (see text). 290 and 280 K with decreasing temperature and 300 and 310K with increasing temperature. This agrees well with the results of resistivity measurement and also the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement by Yamada et al. (3). The fact that the present a"1.05 and 1.10 samples show no anomalous change in resistivity and susceptibility is consistent with the observation by Yamada; the DSC peaks corresponding to the phase transition smeared out in the Li(Li0.035Mn1.965)O4 sample (Li/Mn" 1.0356/2.00) (5). The drastic change in resistivity at 290 K in the a"1.00 sample associated with the structural phase transition shows similarities to the Verwey transition in the Fe3O4 spinel. In Fe3O4 [Fe3` 8a (Fe2`, Fe3`)16dO4] resistivity changes nearly two orders of magnitude at 125 K with the structural phase transition from a high-temperature cubic phase to a low-temperature low-symmetry phase. Although a satisfactory explanation for this transition has not yet FIG. 3. Derivatives of inverse susceptibility, d(1/s)/d1, for a"1.00, 1.05, and 1.10 samples are plotted against temperature. The arrow indicates the phase transition (290 K) seen in the stoichiometric a"1.00 sample. been offered, models based on charge-ordering and polaron-ordering, for example, were proposed to describe the change in resistivity. Above the transition temperature, electron exchange between Fe2` and Fe3` ions at the octahedral site is responsible for high conductivity. The localization of electrons or the ordering of small polarons is believed to cause the increase in resistivity at the Verwey transition temperature (6, 7). In a stoichiometric LiMn2O4 spinel the octahedral site is occupied by Mn3` and Mn4` ions with the ratio of 1 : 1. Thus, similar charge-ordering between Mn3` and Mn4` ions could occur at the structural phase transition temperature. Since Mn3` ions are Jahn—Teller ions, polaron-type conduction due to a strong electron— phonon interaction is expected. If this is the case, the ordering of small polarons could play an important role in the transition. The conductivity at room temperature in the cubic LiMn2O4 spinels (&10~4 S/cm) is far lower than that in Fe3O4 (&102 S/cm). Thus, electron exchange between Mn3` and Mn4` occurs less frequently and conductivity p is well described by a hopping conduction model. In the model, conductivity p as a function of temperature is described as p"(A/1) exp(!E)/k1 ), [1] where A is a constant term including the concentration of hopping ions, E) is hopping activation energy, and k is the Boltzmann constant (6). As shown in Fig. 5, where p1 in a logarithmic scale is plotted against 1/1, log (p1) in the a"1.00 sample above the transition temperature and that 140 SHIMAKAWA, NUMATA, AND TABUCHI FIG. 4. X-ray diffraction peaks of (a) a"1.00 sample at 300 K, (b) a"1.00 sample at 250 K, (c) a"1.10 sample at 300 K, and (d) a"1.10 sample at 250 K. The 2h&44° Bragg peak is indexed as (4 4 0) in the cubic structure, and the 2h&58° peak as (3 3 3) and (5 5 1). Diffraction peaks by CuKa2 X-ray have been subtracted from the observed profile. in the a"1.10 sample for the measured temperature region obey this relationship. The obtained hopping activation energy is 0.16 eV, which is a typical value for thermally activated hopping conduction. Accordingly, a possible charge ordering of Mn3`—Mn4` ions from the disordered hopping state could cause a change in resistivity in the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 spinel. If the conduction in LiMn2O4 results from the hopping of small polarons, the resistivity change at 290 K could be explained by the order—disorder transition of small polarons. In the stoichiometric a"1.00 sample, conductivity below the transition temperature also seems to obey Eq. [1] of the hopping model with almost the same activation energy. This may be explained by the coexistence of cubic and tetragonal phases at low temperatures as shown in Fig. 4. Yamada et al. reported that the volume fraction of the low-temperature tetragonal phase was 65% and that no single phase sample was obtained at 220 K (3). If the ‘‘intrinsic conductivity’’ of the low-temperature tetragonal phase is much lower than that of the high-temperature cubic phase, the observed conductivity below the transition temperature (two-phase region) mainly reflects the nature of the ‘‘unchanged cubic phase.’’ From the magnetic behaviors shown in Fig. 3, d(1/s)/d1 in the a"1.00 sample above the transition temperature and those in the a"1.05 and 1.10 samples above 200 K show constant values. Therefore, the susceptibility shown in Fig. 2 for each temperature range can be fitted by the Curie—Weiss law s"C/(1!h). [2] The obtained Curie constant (C) and Weiss temperature (h) from a least squares fit are listed in Table 1. The results of Curie—Weiss fits and their extrapolated lines are also shown in Fig. 2. With increasing a, the Curie constant decreases, indicating a decrease in effective paramagnetic moment (P%&&). In the paramagnetic region, the Curie constant is written as C"NSP2%&&k2B/3k, [3] where NS and kB are the number of ions and the Bohr magneton, respectively. If we assume that only the spin part of the Mn ions contributes to paramagnetic moment and that the moment is a sum of the effective paramagnetic PROPERTIES OF LiMn2O4 141 FIG. 5. p1 in a logarithmic scale for a"1.00 and 1.10 samples are plotted against 1/1. The results of a least squares fit to Eq. [1] are indicated by the dotted line. moments of Mn3` with high spin configuration (S"2, 4.90 kB) and Mn4` (S"3/2, 3.87 kB) with a ratio of y : (1!y), the Curie constant can be described as C"NSMy4.902#(1!y)3.872Nk2B/3k. [4] Using this equation, the ratios Mn3`/Mn4` of the samples can be estimated. These results are also listed in Table 1. The obtained ionic valence of Mn, #3.50, in the stoichiometric sample is equal to the expected value from the Li1`(Mn3`, Mn4`)O2~ 4 composition. The magnetic data clearly indicate the increase in the average ionic valence of Mn with increasing a. If the excess Li ions in the Li-rich materials are located at interstitial sites as expressed Li1`xMn2O4, the ionic valence of Mn is expected to decrease as a increases. The present results for increased Mn valences in the Li-rich compositions strongly suggest that the Li ions substitute for Mn at the octahedral site. The substitution of Li for Mn is also supported by a recent observation by Numata et al., where density of samples measured by a pycnometer with helium gas decreased with increasing a (9). This behavior of decreasing density is quite similar to the change expected if we assume Li substitution on the octahedral Mn site. In a simple substitution model without vacancy, i.e., Li(LixMn2~x)O4, the average valence of Mn is (7!x)/(2!x). In this model, the a"1.05 and 1.10 samples can be written as Li(Li0.033Mn1.967)O4 and Li(Li0.065Mn1.935)O4 and the valences of Mn are expected to be #3.55 and #3.58, respectively. The valences of Mn obtained from magnetic measurements are slightly higher than the values expected from the simple model. A possible explanation to reconcile this discrepancy is a cation-vacancy model, i.e., Li1~dVd (LixMn2~x~gVg)O4, where V represents the vacancy. This model is plausible because Li2Mn4O9 is known to be a ‘‘defect spinel’’ described as Li0.89V0.11(Mn1.78V0.22)O4 (4, 10). The possibility of overestimating Mn valences, however, cannot be ruled out. The orbital moment of Mn 3d electrons may contribute to the effective paramagnetic moment. The effect of hybridization of the Mn 3d and O 2p orbitals could be included in the observed paramagnetic moment. In the a"1.05 and 1.10 samples, the average Mn valences are greater than #3.5, i.e., the ratios of Jahn—Teller Mn3` ions are less than 50%. Considering that these samples show no anomalies in resistivity and susceptibility, the transition from cubic to tetragonal phase, which is associated with cooperative Jahn—Teller structural distortions, should be suppressed in samples with higher Mn valences. The decrease in lattice constant with increasing a can also be explained by the change of the Mn3`/Mn4` ratio. Since the ionic radius of Mn4` (0.530 As (11)) octahedrally coordinated to oxygen ions is smaller than that of Mn3` (0.645As for the high spin state (11)), the decrease of the Mn3`/Mn4` ratio should cause a decrease in the spinel lattice. Although substitution of Li1` (0.76As for the octahedral coordination (11)) for smaller Mn ions causes counter behavior, the number of produced Mn4` ions is larger than the number of substituting Li1` ions. Thus, the ‘‘average ionic size’’ of the octahedral site decreases with increasing a. The Weiss temperatures of the three samples are negative, indicating antiferromagnetic interaction between the Mn spins. With increasing a, however, the extrapolated Weiss temperatures increase, which suggests that antiferromagnetic interaction decreases in the samples with a higher valence state of Mn. As shown in Fig. 6, ferromagnetic components are seen in M—H behaviors at low temperature in the a"1.05 and 1.10 samples, while M changes linearly with H in the a"1.00 sample. As has been discussed by Goodenough, superexchange interaction in a nearly 90° arrangement of the Mn—O—Mn bond strongly depends on the electron configuration of the cation (6). Ferromagnetic interaction is usual in the Mn4`—O—Mn4` bond, while antiferromagnetic interaction is expected in Mn3`—O—Mn3` and Mn3`—O—Mn4`. Therefore, with increasing concentration of Mn4` ions in the system, the ferromagnetic component is dominant against antiferromagnetic interaction. Tabuchi et al. recently reported similar results on a series of defect spinels Li1~dMn2~2dO4 (12). Masquelier et al. also reported positive Weiss temperature of the Li4Mn5O12 spinel [Li(Li0.33Mn1.67)O4 with an average Mn valence of #4] (13). All these observations suggest a crossover from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic interaction in the samples with high Mn valences. 142 SHIMAKAWA, NUMATA, AND TABUCHI FIG. 6. M—H behaviors at 5K for a"1.00, 1.05, and 1.10 samples. CONCLUSION LiMn2O4 spinels, which will be useful as cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries, were investigated from the viewpoint of transport and magnetic properties. The stoichiometric LiMn2O4 sample showed clear anomalies at 290 K in resistivity and susceptibility, which were associated with the structural phase transition from cubic to tetragonal. This transition has similarities to the Verwey transition seen in the Fe3O4 spinel. Although the conduction mechanism for the LiMn2O4 spinel has not been clarified, a hopping conduction model with an activation energy of about 0.16 eV explained the resistivity behavior for the high-temperature cubic phase. The observed paramagnetic moments were the sum of the effective moments of Mn3` and Mn4` and provided average ionic valences of Mn. The average Mn valences increased with increasing excess Li composition, suggesting Li1` substitution on the Mn site. The structural phase transition was suppressed in samples with higher Mn valences ('#3.5). Superexchange magnetic interaction in the 90° arrangement of Mn—O—Mn changed from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic with increasing Mn4`/Mn3` ratio, as suggested by changes in Weiss temperature and M—H behavior. The present results do not provide any direct information on the performance of battery cells with LiMn2O4 cathodes. However, there were many differences in the physical properties between the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 sample (which usually shows poor cyclability in the 4-V region) and the Li-rich samples (which show better battery performance). The insertion/extraction process of Li ions in the LiMn2O4 spinel might be affected by the natures of parent spinel materials such as crystal structures and average Mn valences.

The electrode was shown to initially consist of 73(1) wt % R3̅m LiMO2 with the remaining 27(1) wt % C2/m Li2MnO3 likely existing as an intergrowth. Cracking in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle under operando microscopy observation was revealed to be initiated by the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase on charge to 4.55 V vs Li+/Li and intensified during further charge to 4.7 V vs Li+/Li during the concurrent two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase, involving the largest lattice change of any phase, and oxygen evolution from the Li2MnO3 phase. Notably, significant healing of the generated cracks in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle occurred during subsequent lithiation on discharge, with this rehealing being principally associated with the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase. This work reveals that while it is the reduction of lattice size of electrode phases during charge that results in cracking of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle, with the extent of cracking correlated to the magnitude of the size change, crack healing is possible in the reverse solid-solution reaction occurring during discharge. Importantly, it is the phase separation during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase that prevents the complete healing of the electrode particle, leading to pulverization over extended cycling. This work points to the minimization of behavior leading to phase separation, such as two-phase and oxygen evolution, as a key strategy in preventing capacity fade of the electrode. ■INTRODUCTION The annual global-energy consumption of approximately 15 TW is estimated to increase to 25−27 TW by 2050.1 In the US, ∼16.8% of annual energy consumption arises from the transportation sector,2 the dominant fuel for which is gasoline, with such fossil fuels resulting in the emission of 30.4 Gt of carbon dioxide, implicated in climate change.3 The development of electric vehicles may alleviate our reliance on fossil fuels, and among the energy-storage devices developed for such applications, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have relatively high energy density compared to other battery types and are the leading candidate.4 The capacity of an electrode is related to both the number of lithium ions that can be reversibly inserted into it and its molecular mass. In a LIB, positive electrodes have a maximum theoretical capacity in the range 268−300 mA h g−1, compared with typical negative electrodes such as graphite (372 mA h g−1)5 and Si (4200 mA h g−1),6 and are thus a major performance bottleneck. Commonly used positive electrodes in LIBs are LiCoO2 and substituted variants, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4. Rapid developments in advanced technologies such as electric transportation have motivated the search for novel Received: April 16, 2016 Published: June 17, 2016 Article pubs.acs.org/JACS © 2016 American Chemical Society 8824 DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b03932 J.

The working potential of layered LiCoO2 is ∼3.8 V, and although the theoretical capacity of this positive electrode material is 274 mA h g−1, only ∼50% of Li+ ions can be reversibly extracted from its structure, as beyond this an irreversible structural transition occurs.7 Thus, the vehicular application of LiCoO2 is restricted by its low practical capacity (∼140 mA h g−1).8 The spinel LiMn2O4 features a high working plateau (4.0 V), although Mn2+ ions, from the disassociation of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Mn4+, dissolve in the electrolyte within a battery, resulting in poor cycling performance after several charge and discharge steps.9,10 The operating voltage and capacity of LiFePO4 limit its energy density, making this material relatively unsuitable for the high-power demands of electric vehicles.11,12 The xLi2MnO3·(1 −x)LiMO2 (Li1+zMO2 where M = Ni, Co Mn) system, consisting of Li2MnO3 (with C2/m space group) and LiMO2 (with R3̅m space group), is a promising positive electrode with a capacity of ∼250−300 mA h g−1,13 approaching its theoretical intercalation capacity. Despite this, this material has several drawbacks, including poor rate14−16 and cycling performance,14,17,18 and a large hysteresis in the charge and discharge curves, particularly in the first few cycles.19−21 Therefore, reducing the capacity loss (50−100 mA h g−1) of Li2MnO3·LiMO2 is a major focus of LIB research.9,13 Li1.2Mn0.567Ni0.166Co0.067O2 is shown to exist predominantly as a bulk LiMO2 structure with an intergrowth of a Li2MnO3like phase, with these phases heterointerface in particle grains.22 The Li2MnO3 phase is shown to exhibit reflections unindexed by the C2/m space group, with these attributed to stacking faults of the ordered lithium/manganese layers along the caxis.23 Understanding the atomistic and molecular-scale origin of battery performance is key to improving the capacity and cycling performance of electrode materials. Most layered-oxide positive electrodes, such as LiCoO2 7 and Li(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2,24 undergo a predominantly solid-solution reaction within their normal operational voltage window, although a two-phase reaction during overdelithiation may present at higher voltages. Charging beyond the normal operating range in order to increase energy density and capacity, e.g., 4.5 or 4.8 V vs Li+/Li for the LiCoO2 material, results in a two-phase reaction that is similar to that occurring in spinel-type materials such as LiMn2O4.25,26 The coexistence of multiple phases over a wide range of lithium content results in phase bordering and interface movement through material grains, and maintaining structure type during lithiation may avoid such phase-border shifts and result in better cycle life.27 For the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 composite electrode, the working w i nd o w i s 2 . 0−4 . 8 V v s L i +/ L i . 9 , 2 3 , 2 8 T he Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 material exhibits significant capacity loss beyond 3.5 V, which is attributed to the transformation from the layered Li2MnO3 to a nanodomained spinel-like LiMn2O4 phase.29 Phase transitions of the xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiMO2 composite electrode during charge and discharge below 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li)9 are reported to involve predominantly the LiMO2 component, which oxidizes to LixMO2 where x ∼0 as Li+ ions are extracted during charge to 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li). During discharge, MO2 reversibly reduces to LiMO2 as Li+ ions are reinserted. During this process the Li2MnO3 phase is inactive as Mn4+ ions cannot oxidize further. Instead, the Li2MnO3 phase is reported to function as a buffer, preventing the structural decomposition of LiMO2 during the extraction of lithium ions.9,13 On charge beyond 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li), Li2MnO3 undergoes an irreversible oxygen-evolution reaction, resulting in the removal of 2 Li+ and O2−(a total loss of Li2O) and the formation of the electrochemically active MnO2-like phase.13 During discharge, Li+ is only partially reinserted into the MnO2like phase, resulting in an initial and irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle.9,13 Thackeray et al. considered the Li2MnO3· LiMO2 as a rock-salt type structure where the octahedral sites of the cubic close-packed oxygen array are occupied, with this phase transforming into a quasi-spinel-like type structure during electrochemical cycling. Under this scheme, capacity fade is thought to originate as a result of the dissolution of Mn2+ in a similar manner to that occurring in the LiMn2O4 positive electrode.9 Members of the xLi2MnO3·(1 −x)LiMO2 family have been investigated using in situ and operando X-ray diffraction (XRD). Mohanty et al. reported the structural transformations of the Li1.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15O2 (Li(Li0.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15)O2) electrode. Ex-situ XRD and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) data show the as-prepared material to be a combination of R3̅m and C2/m phases, appearing as a intergrown system.30 In their operando XRD data, Mohanty et al. are unable to observe the Li2MnO3 C2/m phase and describe the material as a single R3̅m phase with some Li+ occupying the 3b (Li) and 3a (transition metal) crystallographic sites, alongside Ni also occupying the 3b site. On charge to 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li), the c lattice parameter of the R3̅m phase increased while the a lattice parameter reduced. The increase in the c lattice parameter arises as a result of enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the O layers, while the reduction in the a lattice parameter occurs as a result of the increased oxidation state of M ions as Li+ is extracted. On further charging to 4.8 V, the migration of M ions to the Li+ layer causes the c lattice parameter to decrease as further Li+ is extracted, while the a lattice parameter remains unchanged, as a result of the stable oxidation state of the M transition metals during the evolution of oxygen. This behavior is reversible on discharge. Shen et al. investigated the 0.5Li2MnO3·0.5LiNi0.292Co0.375Mn0.333O2 material, and used XRD and SAED to show the as-synthesized material to be a combination of R3̅m LiMO2 and Li2MnO3 C2/m structured phases.31 In their multipotential profile XRD data, they model this material as a single R3̅m phase as per Mohanty et al. Shen et al. report a lattice parameter evolution with battery state of charge that differs to that of Mohanty et al. Compared with the expansion of the c lattice parameter and reduction of the a lattice parameter on charge reported by Mohanty et al., Shen et al. observed the c lattice parameter to decrease and the a lattice parameter to remain unchanged. Shen et al., attribute this behavior to the absence of oxidation during the delithiation occurring alongside the migration of Ni2+ from the transitionmetal site to the Li+ site, on charge from 3.7 to 4.3 V. These differences likely arise from differences in electrochemical steps used in their multipotential approach. Liu et al.32 studied the Li1(Li0.2Ni0.15Mn0.55Co0.1)O2 material and do not report characterization results for the as-prepared compound. In their operando NPD they model the material as a single R3̅m phase as per Mohanty et al.30 and Shen et al.31 On charge to 4.3 V (vs Li+/Li) the c lattice parameter increased while the a lattice parameter reduced as consistent with results of Mohanty et al.,30 corresponding to the extraction of lithium from the 3b site. Beyond 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li) the c lattice parameter decreased Journal of the American Chemical Society Article DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b03932 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 8824−8833 8825 while the a lattice parameter remained unchanged. During the plateau at 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li) they report lithium extraction from both 3b and 3a sites and a ∼30% reduction in lithium content of the 3a site after the first cycle. In the present study we investigate the structural evolution of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 positive electrode with a high charge capacity (302 mA h g−1) using operando neutron powder diffraction (NPD) within a full cell containing a LTO negative electrode. This information is combined, for the first time, with morphology measurements of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 positive electrode that are obtained using operando transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), allowing the correlation of atomic-scale crystallographic and morphological detail to understand electrode function. This combination revealed in detail the underlying phase transformations and mechanisms that are responsible for the initiation and intensification of particle cracking that likely leads to pulverization and capacity fade in this electrode. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Preparation of Electrode Materials. Li2MnO3·LiMO2 was prepared by a coprecipitation method. MnSO4·H2O (JT Baker, 98− 101%), NiSO4·6H2O (JT Baker, 98−102%), and CoSO4·7H2O (Alfa Aesar, 98%) were dissolved in 300 mL deionized (DI) water as a precursor solution. 300 mL of 1 M Na2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) was added into a round-bottom flask and stirred at 500 rpm and CO2 gas was purged through the solution until the pH was 5.5. NH4OH (Sigma-Aldrich, 30−33%) was then added dropwise into the DI water until the acidity reached pH 7.5−8. The precursor solution was then gradually dropped into this solution, and then the remaining precursor and Na2CO3 solutions were simultaneously added, during which the pH was maintained at 7.5−8 by further purging with CO2 gas and NH4OH addition. The combined solution was stirred for 24 h, filtered, and the precipitate washed with DI water and then dried. The dried powder was ground with Li2CO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.998%) and heated at 900 °C in air for 12 h before quenching on a copper plate to obtain Li2MnO3·LiMO2. Hydrous titanium oxide was prepared by the hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 97%, Aldrich) as the precursor for synthesizing Li4Ti5O12 (LTO). Potassium chloride (KCl) (JT Baker, 100%) was dissolved in DI water to prepare a 0.1 M aqueous solution. This solution (0.4 mL) was mixed with 100 mL ethanol and 2.2 mL TTIP, and stirred for 10 min and placed in air atmosphere for 24 h. The resultant precipitate was collected as hydrous titanium oxide. LTO was prepared by dissolving LiOH (Aldrich, > 98%, 3 mmol) in a 100 mL solution of ethanol and DI water (volume ratio 1:1) and dispersing into this 1.2 g hydrous titanium oxide and vigorously stirring for 15 min. The suspension was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. The resulting powder was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with DI water several times, and dried at 180 °C for 3 h followed by a heat treatment at 500 °C in air for 1 h to obtain the final LTO. Characterization of As-Synthesized Electrode Materials. Morphological examination of the as-synthesized Li2MnO3·LiMO2 and LTO electrode materials was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission instrument. The electrode materials were also characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D2 Phaser with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The crystal structure of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 was determined by performing Rietveld analysis against these XRD and high-resolution NPD data collected using ECHIDNA,33 the high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer at the Open Pool Australian Light-water (OPAL) research reactor, at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). The wavelength of neutrons were 1.6215(1) and 2.4393(2) Å, determined using the La11B6 NIST standard reference material (SRM) 660b. The NPD data were obtained in 2.75−163.95° in 2θ with a step size of 0.125°. GSAS-II34 was employed to perform joint Rietveld analysis of the XRD and the two high-resolution NPD data sets. The refineable parameters included background coefficients, zero, peak shape parameters, lattice parameters, phase scale, atomic position parameters, site occupancy factors (SOF), and isotropic atomic displacement parameters (Uiso). Inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) was also performed using an Agilent 7700e to determine the Li: Ni: Mn: Co ratio in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 material. Electrochemical Characterization of Materials. The electrochemical performance of the electrode materials were determined using coin cell-type batteries and a battery tester (AcuTech Systems Co., Ltd.). Electrodes for coin cell batteries were prepared by stirring vigorously overnight the active material, super-P (carbon black), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, in a weight ratio 8:1:1, in Nmethylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and doctor-blading the resultant slurry onto Al foil, before drying overnight at 70 °C in vacuum. Coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (O2 and H2O < 1 ppm). The counter electrode was Li foil and the electrolyte was LiPF6 (1 M) dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 volume ratio). The assembled coin cells were tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The capacity and cycling performance of Li2MnO3·LiMO2 was measured at a current density of 10 mA g−1 within a voltage window of 2.0−4.8 V (vs Li+/Li). The electrochemical performance of the LTO electrode was also tested in a coin-type cell at a current density of 20 mA g−1 within a voltage window of 1.0−3.0 V (vs Li+/Li). Operando Neutron Powder Diffraction. A customized pouchtype battery was prepared for operando neutron powder diffraction (NPD) analysis as per the method reported in Pang and Peterson,35 using the as-synthesized Li2MnO3·LiMO2 and LTO electrode powders, and the cell filled with deuterated EC: DMC (1:1 in vol) electrolyte. Lithium is highly neutron absorbing and the relatively large amount required for the neutron friendly battery can interplay unfavorably with the sample geometry, as well as potentially resulting in lithium plating. Therefore, the well-established and reliable zerostrain LTO electrode was chosen as the counter electrode for the NPD battery, where the solid-electrolyte interface layer formation and Li metal deposition on the LTO surface, leading to degradation of the LIB, is avoided. During the operando NPD experiment the pouch-type battery was cycled galvanostatically using a postentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PG302N) at a current of 11.6 mA (∼0.1 C) with a constant voltage step at 3.4 V in the first cycle and 3.5 V in the second cycle (vs LTO). Operando NPD data were collected using WOMBAT,36 the high-intensity neutron powder diffractometer at ANSTO. A neutron beam of wavelength of 2.95405(2) Å was used, determined using Al2O3 SRM 676. The data were continuously obtained with a collection time of 10 min per pattern in the 2θ range 16.0−136.9°. FullProf with visualization in WinPLOTR37,38 was used to perform sequential Rietveld refinements using the operando NPD data in the 2θ range of 60−130°. The Large Array Manipulation Program (LAMP)39 was employed to perform single-peak analyses of the LiMO2 012 and LTO 222 reflections. Operando Transmission X-ray Microscopy. A coin cell for operando transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) measurement was made using an electrode slurry prepared by stirring vigorously overnight the active material, super-P, and PVDF binder in a weight ratio 8:1:1, in NMP. A free-standing electrode was prepared as per other work40−43 by coating the slurry of the active material onto a Cu foil and then etching by immersion in a FeCl3 aqueous solution. The obtained free-standing electrode was subsequently rinsed with DI water, dried at 80 °C, and used in a coin cell with open windows (Figure S1). The free-standing electrode was adhered to the top cap of the modified coin cell, which then functioned as the current collector. TXM data were obtained at the 01B1 beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Hsinchu City, Taiwan (Figure S1c). Synchrotron X-rays with an energy of 8 keV were used and the transmitted beam passed through a zone-plate and a phase ring to generate an image. The phase ring was positioned at the back focal plane of the zone plate which recorded phase-contrast images at the charge-coupled device (CCD) detector.

The electrochemical characterization was simultaneously carried out using a battery tester (AcuTech Systems Co., Ltd.). The collected TXM images were further processed and analyzed using ImageJ.■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Joint structural refinement of the as-synthesized Li2MnO3· LiMO2 using the two NPD and one XRD data sets (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2) indicate Li2MnO3 and LiMO2 components comprising 27(1) and 73(1) wt % (21(1) and 79(1) mol %), respectively. As expected, the Li2MnO3 component was well described by a monoclinic structure with C2/m space group,30 and LiMO2 was found to adopt an α-NaFeO2 structure with an R3̅m space group.44 The ratios of Li:Mn:Ni:Co determined u s i n g I C P M S w e r e f o u n d t o b e 1.0(56):0.407(9):0.138(4):0.0828(1). The two phase nature of this electrode is consistent with previous work demonstrating that bulk LiMO2 presents as particles intergrown with a Li2MnO3 phase.22 The LTO material was examined using XRD (Figure S2) and confirmed to be phase pure with Fd3̅m spacegroup symmetry. SEM analysis of Li2MnO3·LiMO2 reveals a spherical morphology featuring pinholes on the surface, with a secondary particle size of ∼5−20 μm (Figure 2a). Such pinholes are thought to increase surface area and enhance the diffusion of Li+ into the particle core, improving electrochemical performance.45 The primary particle size of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 was found to be ∼39 nm, obtained from the Scherrer equation using the strongest peak in the XRD data. Similarly, SEM analysis of LTO also revealed particles with a spherical morphology, being composed of primary particles with diameter 20−30 nm. The charge and discharge curves of a coin cell containing Li2MnO3·LiMO2 at a current density of 10 mA g−1 are shown in Figure 3a. The first specific charge and discharge capacities were 302 and 238 mA h g−1, respectively. This initial capacity loss is attributed to the irreversible activation of Li2MnO3,46 leading to the low initial Coulombic efficiency of ∼79%. In the second cycle, the specific charge capacity reduces to 241 mA h g−1, ∼79.8% of the initial capacity, and the Coulombic efficiency increases to ∼94.2%. The 10th specific charge capacity is ∼69.5% (210 mAh g−1) of the initial value, and by the 80th cycle capacity retention is ∼38.6% (Figure 3b). Despite this relatively good capacity, the capacity fade of Li2MnO3·LiMO2 needs to be addressed. The charge and Figure 1.

Soc. 2016, 138, 8824−8833 8827 discharge curve of a coin cell containing LTO at 20 mA g−1 is shown in Figure S3a. The first discharge and charge capacities of LTO were 173 and 162 mA h g−1, respectively, and the initial Coulombic efficiency was 93.7%. The LTO discharge and charge plateaus were ∼1.54 and 1.58 V, respectively. Coulombic efficiencies in the following cycles (up to 80) were retained at ∼100%. The discharge and charge plateaus were stable during subsequent measurements, indicating that LTO is robust to performance degradation. The 80th discharge capacity of LTO was ∼153 mA h g−1, indicating 88.4% retention of initial capacity (Figure S3b). Figure S4 shows the CV results using coin cells with Li2MnO3·LiMO2 as the working electrode. A broad anodic peak is observed in the first charge, from ∼3.7 to 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li), that is associated with the oxidation of Ni2+ and Co3+ in LiMO2 to Ni4+ and Co4+.47 At higher potential, a second anodic peak (>4.5 V (vs Li+/Li)) appears as a result of the activation of Li2MnO3, involving the simultaneous extraction of Li+ and evolution of oxygen.48 During the first discharge, a broad cathodic peak at ∼3.6 V is observed, arising from the reduction of Ni4+ and Co4+ in LiMO2, and a second cathodic peak appears at ∼3.0 V, arising from the reduction of Mn4+.49 In subsequent cycles, the first anodic peak broadens and shifts to ∼4.2 V (vs Li+/Li), and the second anodic peak gradually disappears, indicating irreversibility of the reaction involving Li+ extraction and oxygen evolution from Li2MnO3.46 Finally, the cathodic peak arising from the reduction of Mn4+ shifts to lower potential (∼2.8 V (vs Li+/Li)). Operando NPD was used to investigate the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 phase and structure evolution in a full cell containing a LTO negative electrode during cycling between 0.5 and 3.5 V (vs LTO). The charge and discharge curve of this battery during the operando NPD experiment is shown in Figure S5. The operando NPD patterns of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2∥LTO full battery (Figure 4, showing NPD data as a contour plot against time in a selected 2θ range) reveal changes that correspond to the phase evolution of the electrodes in the battery during electrochemical cycling. The charge−discharge curve for this battery has features that are near-identical to that obtained for coin cells containing Li as the counter electrode. Each NPD pattern within the operando series is for the structural average over the 10 min collection time. The Rietveld-refinement plot using the first pattern in the operando data set is shown in Figure S6, with the LiMO2 and LTO electrode phases, as well as the Al and Cu current collectors, observable. The Li2MnO3 component of the positive electrode, as well as Li2CO3, Li2O, and LiOH·H2O phases expected to be generated at particular potentials,48 were not observable in these data, presumably as a result of the relatively lower symmetry and smaller amount of these phases, in conjunction with the significant background contribution from the Hcontaining battery components. During the sequential Rietveld refinement, the ratio of these phases remained nearly unchanged, and the phase scale factors were subsequently fixed during the sequential refinement. The goodness of fit (χ2) of each Rietveld refinement during sequential analysis is given Figure 2. SEM images of (a) Li2MnO3·LiMO2 and (b) LTO. Figure 3.

Journal of the American Chemical Society Article DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b03932 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 8824−8833 8828 in Figure S7. The Rietveld analysis results are supported by single peak-fitting analysis of the strongest diffraction peaks from the LTO and LiMO2 phases in the operando NPD data, at 2θ of ∼75.5° and 78.5°, corresponding to the LTO 222 and LiMO2 012 reflections, respectively (Figure 4, 5a, and 5b). During battery charge to 3.0 V vs LTO (equivalent to 4.55 V vs Li+/Li), the LiMO2 c lattice parameter increases while the a lattice parameter decreases (Figure 5c). This arises because of the extraction of Li+, leading to enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the oxygen layers, and consequential expansion along the c-axis, revealing delithiation via a solid-solution reaction. The contraction of the a lattice parameter is attributed to the oxidation of M ions as required for charge compensation. The lattice behavior up to 3.0 V vs LTO is similar to that reported in the operando studies by Mohanty et al.30 and Liu et al.32 Notably, the monotonic increase and decrease in c and a parameters are atypical of lithium-ion battery positive electrodes with R3̅m space-group symmetry,24,50,51 but similar to that expected for the composite cathode with Li2MnO3 as a second phase.13,52 Quantitatively, the LiMO2 a lattice parameter reduces by 1.3(1)% and the c lattice parameter expands by 2.0(1)%. Within experimental error, the LiMO2 a and c lattice parameter remain unchanged at potentials higher than 3.0 V (vs LTO or ∼4.55 V vs Li+/Li), consistent with previous operando results,30,32 indicative of a two-phase reaction. During discharge, the reverse occurs, with the a lattice parameter expanding by 2.1(1)% and the c lattice parameter reducing by 2.0(1)%. To further explore the LiMO2 phase behavior, single peak fitting of the LiMO2 012 reflection was performed (Figure 5b). The extracted peak shifts are consistent with the lattice parameter behavior observed using sequential Rietveld analysis. The integrated intensity of the peak describing the LiMO2 012 reflection remains unchanged within error above 3.0 V, however, error in both the integrated intensity and width of this peak increase significantly during this process. This is consistent with the two-phase reaction of LiMO2 occurring alongside the plateau at >3.1 V vs LTO (equivalent to 4.65 V vs Li+/Li), attributed to the electrochemical activation of Li2MnO3 involving oxygen evolution,9,13 with the Li2MnO3 phase not being considered in the work of Liu et al.32 During its twophase reaction, LiMO2 likely evolves to a Li-poor LizMO2 (z ∼ 0) phase as similar to the evolution of CoO2 from overdelithiated LiCoO2;7 however, the limited Q-range of the data make it impossible to determine further the details of this Li-poor phase. It is notable that both two-phase and solid-solution reactions of the positive electrode in the battery are highly reversible, in contrast to the irreversible two-phase reaction between LiCoO2 and CoO2, explaining the good cycle performance of this electrode.7 The LTO lattice behaved as expected, first expanding and then contracting during lithiation (Figure 5c), increasing to 8.358(1) Å after 200 min of charge followed by a reduction to 8.352(1) Å at 1500 min at 3.4 V (vs LTO), in a similar way to previously observed.53,54 On discharge, the LTO lattice parameter linearly increased to 8.356(1) Å at 3000 min during delithiation. Overall, the 0.07(2)% change of the LTO lattice volume indicates a near zero-strain insertion behavior, with high reversibility. The changing Li+ concentration at specific crystallographic sites influences peak position and intensity. Rietveld analysis of the operando NPD data revealed that during battery cycling the concentration of Li+ at the 8asite in the LTO phase remained unchanged within error, while the concentration of Li at the 16c-site varied (Figure S8). The peak width, position, and integrated intensity of the LTO 222 reflection during charge−discharge cycling, obtained from single-peak fitting, are shown in Figure 5a. During the first battery charge from OCV to 2.5 V vs LTO, the LTO 222 reflection intensity remained nearly unchanged while its position shifted to lower 2θ, indicating expansion. This response was followed by a monotonic increase in the reflection intensity alongside a shift in position to higher 2θ, indicating contraction, which continued until the end of lithiation (Figure 5a), consistent with Li+ diffusion between the 8a and 16c sites occurring via the 32e site, as previously observed.53−55 Operando TXM images of a Li2MnO3·LiMO2 particle surrounded by super-P (carbon black for improved electric conductivity) within a coin cell are shown alongside the corresponding charge and discharge curve in Figure 6 (vs Li+/ Li). The electrode material was stable under this characterization using 8 keV X-rays, as expected from previous TXM studies on similar electrodes at these energies.56,57 The features Figure 5.

Soc. 2016, 138, 8824−8833 8829 of the charge−discharge curve of this coin cell are near-identical to that of the pouch cell containing LTO used in the NPD study. The diameter of the approximately spherical Li2MnO3· LiMO2 particle at the open-circuit voltage (OCV) was ∼10 μm (Figure 6b). During charge to 4.5 V cracks in the Li2MnO3· LiMO2 electrode particle appeared (red dotted box in Figure 6c), which developed further during charge to 4.7 V (Figure 6d and 6e). During discharge, the particle cracking faded (Figure 6f), and the particle appeared to almost heal and be slightly smaller than its initial state, by 2.0 V (Figure 6g). The change in size of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 particle during charge and discharge is quantified in Table 3 and the change in the particle appearance is shown by the differential TXM images in Figure 7. There is a strong correlation between the change in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle cracking and particle volume. The appearance of cracks in the Li2MnO3· LiMO2 electrode particle on charge to 4.5 V (vs Li+/Li, red circle in Figure 7a) is accompanied by a ∼2% reduction in volume (Table 3). The significant development of the particle cracks on charging to 4.7 V is accompanied by a more significant (∼3%) reduction in particle volume (Figure 7b). Almost no change in the particle cracks or the particle volume occurred during the discharge to 3.6 V (Figure 7c). Interestingly, further discharge to 2.0 V revealed partial healing of the cracks in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode, accompanied by a ∼3% volume expansion (Figure 7d). The particle crack formation and healing taking place overall on charge and discharge are shown in Figure 7e and 7f, respectively. Electrochemical function alongside crystallographic and morphological changes of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode during charge and discharge are summarized in Scheme 1. During the development of the cracks in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 composite particle under TXM observation on charge to 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li), the NPD data revealed that the LiMO2 phase underwent a solid-solution reaction with a ∼2.0% expansion of the c lattice parameter and a concomitant contraction of the a lattice parameter by ∼1.3%, constituting an overall volume reduction of ∼0.4%. The TXM images reveal a ∼2% volume reduction in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 particle during this time. The further crack development and volume reduction (∼3%) of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle during charging beyond 4.5 V (vs Li+/Li) corresponds to the irreversible evolution of oxygen from the Li2MnO3 phase as it transforms to MnO2 and the two-phase reaction of LiMO2 revealed by the NPD data. It is the stress induced as a result of the mismatch of lattice parameters during the two-phase reaction of such electrode materials, e.g., LiMn2O4, that is thought to be responsible for capacity fade.58 The limited Q-range of the operando NPD data makes it impossible to determine the product of the two-phase reaction of LiMO2. Structural detail regarding this two-phase reaction was gained from examination of the LiMO2 012 reflection and previous work regarding the solid-solution and two-phase reactions of the isostructural LiCoO2 material reported in Amatucci et al.7 In the two-phase regime occurring during charge, the LiMO2 d012 contracts by ∼0.6%, significantly less than the ∼1.1% contraction of the LiCoO2 d012 that corresponds to a 8.1% reduction in LiCoO2 lattice volume upon full delithiation. This suggests that the reduction in the LiMO2 lattice during the two-phase reaction occurring on charge is likely to be less than 8% (estimated at ∼4.4% from the relative changes in d012 between the LiMO2 and LiCoO2 materials), with this constituting the most Figure 6.

Soc. 2016, 138, 8824−8833 8830 significant volume change and corresponding to the most severe particle cracking. Upon discharge to 3.6 V (vs Li+/Li), the two-phase reaction of LiMO2 is reversed, with this correlating to a nearly unchanged morphology and size of the composite particle under TXM observation. Importantly, the generated particle cracks began to heal during the subsequent lithiation step (below 3.6 V vs Li+/Li), with this rehealing process being principally associated with the reversible solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase, which involves reduction of Ni4+ to Ni2+ (with ionic radii 0.48 and 0.69 Å, respectively) and Co4+ to Co3+ (with ionic radii 0.53 to 0.61 Å, respectively). The Li2MnO3·LiMO2 particle under TXM observation expands by ∼3% during this healing step, consistent with the ∼2.2% volume expansion indicated by the NPD measurement for this process. Interestingly, the healing of the particle cracks does not occur during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase on discharge, despite this being accompanied by the largest expansion in phase volume. During delithiation, the direction of the reduction in particle size during the LiMO2 phase solidsolution reaction (Figure 7a) was significantly different to that for the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase (also involving oxygen evolution from Li2MnO3, Figure 7b), indicative of phase separation in the composite particle. By dividing the multiphase positive electrode particle under TXM observation into quadrants (as shown by regions I−IV in Figure S9 in the EIS) the direction of particle size changes can be compared between charge and discharge processes. The solid-solution reaction of LiMO2 on charging to 4.5 V (vs Li+/ Li) resulted in particle size reduction in quadrants I and II, with particle cracks appearing in quadrant II (Figure S9a). Size reduction during the following two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase and the reaction releasing oxygen from the Li2MnO3 phase occurred in quadrants II and III, where the cracking in the particle intensified (Figure S9b). On discharge to 3.6 V, the particle size remained nearly unchanged (Figure S9c). On further discharge from 3.6 to 2.0 V (vs Li+/Li) and during the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase, healing of the particle cracks occurred, presumably triggered by expansion in this quadrant. Other significant particle-size changes during this period took place in quadrants I and IV (Figure S9d). Overall, with respect to the original particle at OCV, the first charge process resulted in a significant shrinkage in quadrants II and III (Figure S9e), compared with minor contraction in quadrants I and II following the whole first cycle (Figure S9f). Phase-border shifts such as these are thought to contribute to poor cycle life,27 with the spinel LiMn2O4-like phase transformed following the evolution of oxygen by Li2MnO3 in the Li(Li0.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 layered−layered composite electrode known to consist of nanodomains.29 Taken together, these results point to phase separation within the intergrown multiphase particle occurring in concert with phase lattice-size changes during extended cycling as the underlying reasons for capacity loss of this electrode. ■CONCLUSIONS Operando neutron powder diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy were applied to characterize the structural and morphological evolution of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 (M = Li, Mn, Ni, Co) composite electrode, with the operando approach enabling this information to be directly correlated to electrochemical function. The unique combination of these operando methods revealed the underlying phase transformations and mechanisms that are responsible for the initiation and intensification of particle cracking that likely leads to pulverization and capacity fade in this electrode. The electrode is composed of ∼27 wt % (C2/m space group) Li2MnO3 and ∼73 wt % LiMO2 (R3̅m space group), with this multiphase composite shown previously to occur as an intergrowth system. Scheme 1.

During the initial charge to 3.0 V vs LTO (4.55 V vs Li+/Li), the LiMO2 phase undergoes a solid-solution reaction involving a ∼0.4% reduction in crystal volume that was associated with the appearance of cracks in the electrode particle under observation in the TXM experiment. On further charge to 3.15 V vs LTO (4.7 V vs Li+/Li) the LiMO2 phase underwent a two-phase reaction that occurred alongside the irreversible evolution of oxygen from the Li2MnO3 phase. The two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase involves the most substantial change in phase volume for any electrode phase during its entire working range (estimated at ∼4.4% between phases), and is correlated with the significant intensification of cracking in the electrode particle under TXM observation. Therefore, this work reveals that while it is the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase on charge that likely causes electrode particle pulverization leading to capacity loss, it is the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase preceding this reaction that initiates particle cracking. During discharge, both the two-phase and solid-solution reactions of the LiMO2 phase are reversed, and the cracks in the electrode particle under TXM observation are healed by the corresponding expansion in phase volume. Interestingly, it is the volume expansion taking place only during the solidsolution, and not the two-phase, reaction that is associated with this crack healing, despite the LiMO2 two-phase process having a substantially larger volume expansion than the solid-solution process of the LiMO2 phase. The TXM images point to phase separation occurring during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase as the reason for the limited recovery of the electrode during this process, as evidenced by strong anisotropy in electrode particle size changes occurring. Overall, it is both the magnitude of the phase lattice change and phase separation that leads to capacity fade of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 composite electrode, with this work suggesting that the minimization of phase separation is key to reducing capacity fade of this electrode. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b03932.

Proton-Induced Disproportionation of Jahn−Teller-Active Transition-Metal Ions in Oxides Due to Electronically Driven Lattice Instability Hooman Yaghoobnejad Asl and Arumugam Manthiram* Cite This: J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 21122−21130 Read Online ACCESS Metrics & More Article Recommendations * sı Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The interfacial chemical reactivity of Jahn−Telleractive transition-metal oxides remains an enigmatic area, often leading to uncontrollable phase transformations in the oxide-based technological applications. In particular, the higher tendency of unwanted transition-metal-ion dissolution and side-reactions in Jahn−Teller-active oxides is accompanied by performance degradation in many electrochemical systems, for example, lithium-ion batteries. We show here that the fundamental electronic structure instability that leads to Jahn−Teller (lattice) distortion in an octahedral ligand field is the active chemical driving force for the spontaneous disproportionation, phase transformation, and metal-ion dissolution in transition-metal oxides upon exposure to protons. On the basis of electronic structure analyses and 18O isotope labeling, we present a mechanism comprising a coupled acid−base/redox reaction that leads to a proton-induced disproportionation of Jahn−Teller-active transition-metal ions, as exemplified by the broad classes of respective oxides. ■INTRODUCTION The Jahn−Teller (JT) phenomenon is a quantum mechanical property that results from the occupation of a degenerate orbital set with an asymmetric electronic density. Commonly, in the transition-metal (TM) compounds, a strong JT effect results when an odd number of electrons occupy the TM eg orbital set (viz. dz 2−r 2 and dx 2−y 2) of the corresponding octahedral (Oh) ligand field. The literature reveals a rich history of various physical properties emerging as a result of the JT effect. Some examples are magnetic,1 optical,2 thermal,3 electronic transport,4 and mechanical properties.5 These physical properties are mostly reversible, commensurate with the thermal phase transitions between JT active/inactive states when such temperature-dependent phase transitions exist. Many of these properties can be predicted and explained quantitatively via the construction of the JT Hamiltonian of the bulk system6 and are known to the scientific community. In conspicuous contrast, the “irreversible” chemical reactivity imposed by the JT effect is mostly unexplored, unlike their physical counterparts. Evidently, as a result of geometrical symmetry breaking, an anisotropic chemical reactivity is imparted to the system that could lead to unusual behaviors. In the context of the condensed materials and extended structures, the lack of knowledge surrounding the JT-induced chemical reactivity originates from the fact that these transformations occur only at the phase boundaries of a multicomponent, heterogeneous system (e.g., solid−liquid interface), which is fundamentally more complicated than those physical transformations occurring within the bulk of a single component and homogeneous phase. The first-row TM ions in an idealized Oh ligand field experiencing a strong (i.e., eg band) JT effect include Mn3+ (high spin, t2g 3eg 1), Fe4+ (high spin, t2g 3eg 1), Ni3+ (low spin, t2g 6eg 1), and Cu2+ (t2g 6eg 3). The chemistry of these ions is central to some of the life-changing technological advancements. For example, Mn3+/Mn4+, Fe3+/Fe4+, and Ni2+/Ni3+/ Ni4+ couples are heavily employed as redox-active centers in primary and secondary (rechargeable) batteries with aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes, including the ground-breaking Li-ion batteries (LIBs).7−10 Also, complex oxides based on mixed oxidation states, such as Mn3+/Mn4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+, are employed as electrocatalysts in fuel cells11 and electrolytic water splitting12 and as photoanodes in solar fuel generators.13 Finally, the Cu2+/Cu3+ couple is a key component in hightemperature copper oxide superconductors.14 In the above Received: September 19, 2020 Published: December 7, 2020 Article pubs.acs.org/JACS © 2020 American Chemical Society 21122 https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c10044 J.

For example, in LIBs, TM-ion dissolution and phase transformations under ppm levels of acidity in the electrolyte are identified as a leading cause of cell aging.15 Furthermore, the phase transformations are exacerbated by the JT-active Mn3+and Ni3+-containing oxides.16,17 Therefore, there are true incentives to understand the higher chemical reactivity of JTactive oxides from a fundamental point of view. We focus here to tackle the chemical reactivity of JT-active phases, aiming to instigate a systematic approach to close the gap between different aspects of the JT effect in the solid state. In particular, we are attempting to explain and generalize the disproportionation of JT-active transition-metal oxides (TMOs) in the presence of the Arrhenius acidic species, H3O+. This interesting reaction was reported first by Hunter in 1981 during the chemical oxidation of the spinel LiMn3.5+ 2O4 to λ-Mn4+ 2O4 through acid treatment in an aqueous solution.18 Three years later, Ohzuku et al. reported a proton-assisted oxidative structural conversion of bixbyite Mn3+ 2O3 and spinel Mn2.67+ 3O4 into pyrolusite Mn4+O2, through the action of hot sulfuric acid.19 In 1999, Arai et al. extended the acid treatment approach to the oxidation of layered rocksalt LiNi3+O2 and obtained highly delithiated layered Li1−xNi(3+x)+O2 (0.5 ≤x ≤ 1.0).20 The peculiarity surrounding these reactions emanates from the fact that the disproportionation of the TM cations to the 4+ higher oxidation state seems to be triggered internally from the TMO electronic structure features, as H+ is too weak as an oxidizer to induce such high oxidation states of the TM cations. Furthermore, the extent of Ni3+/Ni4+ oxidation in Li1−xNiO2 obtained with acid treatment is significantly higher than that which can be achieved with a strong oxidizer such as the nitronium cation (NO2 +). On the one hand, this shows the strong internal chemical driving force contained in these disproportionation reactions and, on the other hand, the usefulness of this method for soft chemical synthesis of metastable phases. In an attempt to explain the reaction mechanism based on the available experimental data, Hunter accounted electronic disproportionation between Mn atoms to be responsible for the oxidation reaction,18 according to eq 1: LiMn Mn O 2H 0.75 Mn O 0.5Mn Li H O 3 4 4 4 2 4(s) (aq) 2 (aq) 2 λ + → ‐ + + + + + + + + + (1) Unraveling the exact mechanism governing the above disproportionation reaction necessitates addressing several questions. First and foremost, what is the chemical driving force for such strongly irreversible reactions, and how is H+ involved? Second, what is the electron-transfer pathway between the transition metals? Third, can this reaction be extended to other phases, particularly those with multivalent and heavy cations? An affirmative answer to the third question can unlock new opportunities for solid-state synthesis purposes. In answering the first question, it is important to note that the phases demonstrated so far to undergo acidinduced disproportionation contain JT-active transition-metal ions of Mn3+ and Ni3+ in an Oh environment. Therefore, it was hypothesized that JT distortion is the actual chemical driving force behind the proton-induced disproportionation reaction, envisaging a new dimension in the chemical reactivity of JTactive oxides. To validate this hypothesis, we studied the propensity of the H+-induced disproportionation reaction in a variety of ternary oxides with JT-active transition-metal centers, with a general formula AxMyOz (A: mono-, di-, and trivalent fixed oxidation state cations; M: JT-active transition metal, e.g., Mn3+, Fe4+, Ni3+, and Cu2+ in CuO. Our results indicate that regardless of the specific atomic compositions and structural geometries employed, the disproportionation of the JT-active TM cation to the higher state occurs universally upon contact with H+, confirming the role of the JT distortion as the true chemical driving force. Finally, using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, we derived an atomistic reaction mechanism that maps the chemical reactivity in terms of the electronic structure descriptors, providing a detailed picture of the acid reactivity of JT-active TMOs across the widely varying families. According to the proposed mechanism, the disproportionation of JT-active oxides is a result of a coupled H+-redox reaction mediated by the oxygen ligand through the O 2p ligand holes. The two fundamental natural forces driving this reaction toward completion are (i) relieving the lattice electronic instability incurred by the Jahn−Teller effect and (ii) reduction of the oxygen (filling the O 2p holes) as a result of oxide protonation. It is anticipated that the outcomes of this study offer some insights into a better understanding of the unusual features encountered with JT-active TMOs. Alternatively, the mechanism provided here can be used as a synthesis tool for designing new and metastable materials with unusual atomic arrangements and oxidation states as well as interesting ionic, electronic, and magnetic properties. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Reagents. All reagents for syntheses were purchased from SigmaAldrich and Fischer Scientific and used as received. For isotope labeling studies of λ-MnO2, H2 18O (80% 18O enrichment) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used with concentrated H2SO4, as described in the Acid Treatment section. Syntheses. Orthorhombic LiMnO2,21 α-NaMnO2,22 perovskite LaMnO3 (trigonal and orthorhombic modifications),23 BiMn2O5,24 marokite CaMn2O4,25 layered LiNiO2,26 perovskite LaNiO3,27 and Sr1.286NiO3 28 were prepared following the previously reported methods. The perovskite CaFeO3 was synthesized with soft chemical oxidation of CaFeO2.5 with sodium hypochlorite.29 However, because of the limited concentration of the hypochlorite solution (6%) in hand, incomplete oxidation of CaFeO2.5 to CaFeO3 was achieved. Iodometric redox titration results suggest ∼40% Fe4+ in the obtained mixture. All other phases were obtained with high purity. Materials Characterization. XRD patterns of the phases were recorded with a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToFSIMS) analyses of 18O−and 16O−ions were performed with an IONTOF TOF.SIMS 5 spectrometer with a nominal mass resolution better than 1000 (m/δm) and a 500 V accelerated Cs+ ion-beam for depth profiling. The magnetic response of nickel oxide samples was obtained with a Quantum Design DynaCool PPMS system having a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) measuring module. The magnetic susceptibilities were obtained upon warming from 2 to 300 K at a Bapp of 1000 Oe after a zero-field cooling of the sample. A Cary 5000 spectrometer was used for recording the optical absorption spectrum. The oxidation state analyses were performed with iodometric redox titration in an automated titrator with a potentiometric end-point detection system. The solution potential trend of LiNiO2 acidified solutions was measured with an inert Pt indicator and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode with a Biologic VMP potentiostat. Acid Treatment. For acid-treatment experiments, a weighted sample of the oxide was placed in contact with an appropriate volume of a 6 N acid to achieve 20 times excess H+:TM (mole ratio) under constant stirring. Despite the disproportionation reaction working in Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Article https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c10044 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 21122−21130 21123 general with much weaker acidic solutions, the concentrated acidic solutions were used in this work to drive the reactions at the maximum rate. Also, this helps to minimize other possible variables, such as solid particle-size distribution, morphology, and composition, which may affect the interpretation of the results across the widely varying oxides prepared under different conditions. Reaction times varied as reported for the individual cases. An H2SO4 solution was used for acid-treatment experiments of CuO and ternary oxides with alkali ions. For other cases, an HNO3 solution was used to avoid sulfate precipitation of Ca2+, La3+, or Bi3+ ions. The role of nitrate in the oxidation of the JT-active TMOs during the acid treatment experiments can be ruled out, despite the moderately oxidizing nature of NO3 −. This is because all the disproportionation reactions were verified to occur also with the redox-inactive H2SO4 acid. Furthermore, NO3 −is too weak as an oxidizer to induce Ni3+/4+ or Fe4+/6+ oxidations under the conditions used in this work. For isotope labeling studies, spinel LiMn2O4 was mixed with a 2 N H2SO4 solution prepared with 18O-enriched water and stirred overnight, followed by filtration and multiple washes with natural water to remove the disproportionation byproducts and traces of H2 18O. Computational Methods. The ground-state electronic structures of spinel MgMn2O4, orthorhombic LiMnO2, α-NaMnO2, stoichiometric perovskite LaMnO3, and CuO were calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level with the plane-wave basis Quantum Espresso code.30 The wave functions were modeled with the projector augmented wave (PAW) functionals with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation treatment, as parametrized following the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) method.31 In each case, an electronic kinetic energy cutoffof 50 Ry was used, along with a uniform K-space sampling by the Monkhorst−Pack method,32 so that the number of grid points exceeds 1000/number of atoms in the simulation cell. For all cases, antiferromagnetic spinpolarized calculations were performed with no Hubbard +U correction to obtain the unperturbed ground state of each system. Despite the underestimated bandgap parameter, such an assumption does not interfere with the derivation of the molecular orbital diagrams. Moments were arranged in the appropriately sized magnetic cells for the orthorhombic LiMnO2,33 α-NaMnO2,34 LaMnO3,35 and CuO,36 following the reported magnetic structures. Also, postprocessing of orbital overlaps was performed by the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis with the LOBSTER code.37 In each case, a pseudo-orthogonal lattice was defined based on the DFT relaxed structure in which the TMO bonds are aligned with the lattice edges. Such an unconventional cell definition helps to map orbital overlaps into the basic 3d orbitals of transition-metal ions, resolved by angular momentum. Finally, the charges localized on oxygen atoms in various oxides and H2O were evaluated according to the Bader algorithm with the Bader Charge Analysis code.38 For charge calculations, H2O was relaxed in a dummy cubic cell with an edge length of 10 Å and treated as an isolated molecule. ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Here, we first present an atomistic mechanism for the acidinduced disproportionation of JT-active TMOs, followed by experimental evidence supporting the proposed mechanism. Before the inspection of the electronic structure of JT-active TMOs, it is worth noting the electron-transfer path during the solid-state charge disproportionation. Hunter hypothesized a net electron transfer between adjacent TM centers to lead to the disproportionation reaction.18 A direct electron transfer between TM centers requires a significant overlap between d orbitals. As both the spinel LiMn2O4 and layered rocksalt LiNiO2 oxides share a common TMO6 octahedral edge in a cubic close-packed oxygen array with a 90° TM−O−TM bonds, they ensure an effective overlap between the t2g orbitals of adjacent TM ions (Figure S1a). However, as we will show, the disproportionation reaction also occurs in the perovskite ABO3 (A: redox-inactive cation; B: JT-active TM ion) oxides, having corner-shared TMO6 units, ∼180° TM−O−TM bonds, and no direct overlap between t2g orbitals (Figure S1b). Thus, it is imperative that the oxide ligands play a crucial role in mediating the electron transfer between TM centers, as will be discussed next. First-principle theoretical calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level was implemented to assess the underlying source of electronic structure instability imposed by the JT effect. In doing so, we took spinel MgMn2O4 since its 0 K electronic structure (which is simulated by the DFT) is the same as its room-temperature analogue, unlike the LiMn2O4 counterpart that undergoes a cooperative/noncooperative JT distortion just below room temperature.39 Figure 1a demonstrates the DFT-derived projected density of states (PDOS) for the Mn d orbitals in MgMn2O4, indicating the energy separation of these states in the tetragonal crystal field (point group D4h) of the MnO6 fragment, distorted by the JT effect. The obtained band diagram was further processed by COHP40 to deduce the strength and nature of TMO orbital interactions into bonding and antibonding (Figure 1b). Finally, combining the PDOS and COHP data allows us to construct a semiquantitative, σ-only molecular diagram (MO) via the symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of atomic orbitals (the σ-bonding MOs are presented in Figure S2). It is worth mentioning that ignoring the sub-Fermi π-interactions (mainly due to the t2g band) and higher energy states (Mn 4s, 4p) will not affect the derivation of the MO diagram. The overlap between Mn dx 2−r 2 and two O 2pz ligand group orbitals with a1g symmetry yields three MOs: two low-lying (−5 eV vs EF) with significant O 2p character and a highestoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) at the EF with considerable Mn dz 2−r 2 character that is heavily antibonding in nature (Figure 1b). Therefore, the half-filled, antibonding HOMO is the primary cause of electronic structure instability incurred by the JT distortion. Consequently, the minimization Figure 1.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 21122−21130 21124 of the HOMO single-electron density via charge redistribution can be pursued as a strategy to minimize the total internal energy. In some JT-active oxides, charge ordering has been reported as a mechanism to mitigate the energetically unfavorable HOMO electronic structure instability. For example, it has been demonstrated that the nominally JT-active AFe4+O3 (A: Ca2+, Sr2+) undergoes a charge ordering into JT-inactive Fe3+ (t2g 3 eg2) and Fe5+ (t2g 3 eg0) ions to minimize the electronic structure instability associated with the Fe4+ configuration (t2g 3eg 1).41 Furthermore, it has been shown the Fe5+ state is partially mixed with oxide-ligand holes, as in t2g 3eg 2 L2, indicating the active role of O 2p states in the charge disproportionation.42 Similarly, the participation of oxideligand holes in the charge balance of JT-active LiNiO2 has also been demonstrated through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, indicating the presence of a Ni2+ (t2g 6eg 2 L1) state.43 These observations indicate that charge ordering and participation of O 2p ligand holes contribute significantly to the solid-state chemistry of TMOs under the JT effect as a mechanism to minimize the electronic structure instability. Furthermore, the extent of ligand-hole participation seems to be directly proportional to the effective nuclear charge of the TM ion under the JT effect: Mn3+ < Ni3+ ≈Fe4+. As there is no fundamental difference between the identical TM atoms involved in charge ordering, it is expected that the electron jump to be a dynamic process, which is often hidden from direct observations, including the time-independent DFT. Although the direct observation of solid-state charge ordering in TMOs under the JT effect could be challenging, the H+-induced charge disproportionation can be shown to be a direct outcome. Extension of the charge-ordering concept to the specific case of MgMn2O4 implies that throughout the solid charges are ordered between adjacent Mn3+ ions as Mn(3+δ)+− O(1+δ)−−Mn2+ (Figure 2a), with the Mn centers exchanging their charges dynamically. Accordingly, oxygen 2p states are involved in mediating the electronic exchange between neighboring Mn centers by donating a fraction of one electron density to reduce one of the Mn ions to the lower oxidation state. Because of the Mn2+/Mn(3+δ)+ charge ordering, the partially filled antibonding HOMO state electron density in Mn3+ is reduced. Consequently, the system energy is minimized compared to a situation where the 3+ charge is localized uniformly on the Mn centers. As a JT-active oxide is exposed to an acidic solution containing H+ ions, the instantaneous charge ordering is locked in permanently. This occurs by a protonation of the basic oxide groups at the solid−liquid interface, forming H2O. However, conversion of the oxide of the TMO lattice with localized ligand holes to the oxygen in H2O with no ligand hole requires a compensating electron transfer from the TMO valence band to the O 2p orbitals. Thus, oxide protonation is coupled to a transfer of the remaining electron density from Mn(3+δ)+ (HOMO with 3dz 2−r 2 character) to the electrondeficient O 2p orbital, leading to Mn oxidation, as shown schematically in Figure 2b. Therefore, the net effect of the above transformations is the reduction and oxidation of the nominally Mn3+ ions to respectively Mn2+ and Mn4+, along with the formation of H2O, collectively describing a disproportionation reaction. The resultant lower oxidation state Mn2+ may readily dissolve into the solution, while the high-valent Mn4+ remains in the solid due to the highly covalent Mn−O bonds. Being an optimum leaving group, the as-formed H2O may leave behind the undercoordinated Mn4+O5 species. However, stabilization of the Mn4+ ion via H2O coordination or oxide ligand rearrangement can preserve the high-valent Mn4+ as in Mn4+O6 octahedral units of the resultant Mn4+O2. In essence, the two driving forces acting on the disproportionation are (i) minimizing the residual electron density in the antibonding HOMO (i.e., JT-induced electronic instability) and (ii) reduction of oxygen from the electrondeficient oxide to the electron-rich H2O. Table S1 provides the calculated Bader charge localized on oxygen in various JTactive TMOs examined experimentally for disproportionation in this work as compared to the oxygen charge in H2O. According to the proposed mechanism, Mn3+ oxidation is chemically driven by the removal of the oxide ligand along with the shared electrons from MnO6 octahedral coordination. To confirm this assertion, 18O isotope labeling was used along with the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToFSIMS) to study the oxygen lattice of the λ-Mn4+O2 obtained through disproportionation. The starting LiMn2O4 phase with natural oxygen isotopes distribution (16O 99.757%, 18O 0.205%) was treated in an acidic solution containing 18Oenriched H2O as the solvent to trap the undercoordinated Mn4+O5 surface intermediates formed (Figure 3a,b). Figure 3c shows the 18O/16O isotopes frequency ratio as a function of the specimen depth (represented by the Cs+ sputtering time), which is about 30% higher in the bulk of the λ-MnO2 prepared with H2 18O compared to a blank sample obtained under similar conditions with natural H2O. The higher relative abundance of 18O in the oxide lattice of λ-Mn4+O2 obtained with 18O-enriched water corroborates the proposed mechanism of coupled oxide removal and Mn3+ oxidation. An electrophilic attack by H+ on the oxide of the six-coordinate Mn3+O6 unit leads to the formation of the five-coordinate Mn4+O5 transition state, which is further attacked by H2 18O in the solution to incorporate 18O into the oxide framework of the λ-MnO2 as Mn4+[16O5][18O] octahedral units (Figure 3d). However, the overall low concentration of 18O in the λ-MnO2 suggests that the Mn4+O5 is a high-energy transition state, and the majority of the Mn4+ centers are relaxed through oxide rearrangement within the solid via a concerted oxygen exchange to avoid the Mn4+O5 transition state (Figure 3e). Figure 2.

The blue-pink clouds represent different phases of the HOMO electronic wave function. Mg2+ ions are not shown for clarity. (b) Protonation of the basic, electron-deficient oxide at the surface (dotted blue arrows), along with the transfer of the residual electron density from the Mn dz 2−r 2 orbital to the O 2p orbital, leads to the oxidation of the Mn to 4+ state (red arrow) and formation of H2O. Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Article https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c10044 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 21122−21130 21125 Compared to the Hunter mechanism, the disproportionation scheme described above differs in two aspects: (i) it depends solely on the presence of the JT effect, and (ii) the electron exchange between adjacent TM ions is mediated by the bridging O 2p states via ligand holes, which is disrupted through oxide protonation. Thus, it is anticipated that any JTactive oxide can undergo disproportionation in the presence of H+, as demonstrated in the following for a number of structurally and compositionally varying oxides containing JT-active ions of Mn3+, Fe4+, Ni3+, and Cu2+. Locally, the JT effect can reduce the idealized Oh symmetry of TMO6 in various ways, leading to different patterns of orbital mixing within the TM−O moiety. For example, the calculated MO diagrams for the MnO6 moiety for orthorhombic (o-) LiMnO2 (C2v), α-NaMnO2 (C2h), and perovskite LaMnO3 (D2h) are given respectively in Figure S3a−c. Despite the seemingly different MnO6 local symmetry, it is evident that the formation of an antibonding, half-filled HOMO with Mn dz 2−r 2 character is unanimous across different JT arrangements. Therefore, one may expect that the stabilizing O 2p ligand-hole-mediated charge ordering is playing a role, leading to the susceptibility of these phases toward H+-induced disproportionation. The acid treatment of the JT-active α-NaMn3+O2 and oLiMn3+O2 phases for 900 s yields respectively birnessite Na0.3MnO2·0.4H2O (Figure 4a,b) and layered rhombohedral (r-)Li0.5MnO2 (Figure 4c,d), both with a significant amount of Mn4+ present. It can be demonstrated that in both cases the disproportionation products are structurally related to the parent phases (Figure S4), indicating that the acid-induced disproportionation favors kinetically stabilized products. As the disproportionation reactions are performed at room temperature and it involves a rearrangement of the oxygen sublattice, this method can be effectively used as a soft chemical approach for the synthesis of metastable phases from JT-active starting phases. For example, r-Li1−xMnO2 (Figure 4d) was previously made through a Li+/Na+ ion-exchange reaction of the parent αNaMnO2 phase at 160 °C for 2 weeks and subsequent Li+ removal.22 To further validate the dependence of the disproportionation reaction on the JT effect, it is possible to demonstrate that a JT-free Mn3+ ion indeed does not undergo disproportionation under acidic environments. For example, the acid treatment of BiMn3+Mn4+O5 for 24 h yields no phase conversion or reaction (Figure S5). The Mn3+ and Mn4+ centers in BiMn2O5 are respectively in square-pyramidal and Oh environments,24 which are both JT-inactive. Despite the equal average charge on the Mn atoms in BiMn3+Mn4+O5 and LiMn3+Mn4+O4, the difference in the acid reactivity fundamentally traces back to the less symmetric Mn3+O5 local environment (C4v), the absence of the JT effect, and the lack of subsequent charge ordering that is the basis of acid-induced disproportionation. Finally, in the context of JT-active Mn-based oxides, the disproportionation of the JT-active, perovskite LaMnO3 can be considered (Figure 5). Two modifications of the mixed-valence perovskite LaMnO3 are examined here: the orthorhombic polymorph (Pnma) with Mn ions predominantly in the 3+ state and a cooperative JT effect and the cation-deficient rhombohedral phase (R-3c) with a significant Mn4+ present and a noncooperative JT effect.44 The orthorhombic La0.955Mn3+ 0.86Mn4+ 0.14O3 with macroscopic JT distortion disproportionates completely into εMn4+ 2O4 and MnO (Figure 5a,b), in conjunction with the proposed mechanism. The rhombohedral modification La0.89Mn3+ 0.67Mn4+ 0.33O3, with a higher fraction of Mn4+, partially oxidizes to LaMn2O5 (Figure 5c,d) with no further change thereafter. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of Figure 3. (a, b) ToF-SIMS 18O−/16O−surface maps of λ-MnO2 obtained by the acid treatment in respectively natural H2O and 18Oenriched H2O. (c) 18O−/16O−ratio as a function of specimen depth for two λ-MnO2 samples obtained with natural H2O and 18O-enriched H2O.

Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Article https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c10044 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 21122−21130 21126 the disproportionation reaction on the relative amount of the JT-active Mn3+ initially present, which can be used as a design concept to obtain different product phases. The orthorhombic modification has a higher fraction of JT-active Mn3+, thus driving the disproportionation reaction to completion. On the contrary, the rhombohedral modification has a significant fraction of JT-inactive Mn4+ that is fundamentally inactive toward disproportionation, yielding a partial oxidation to LaMn2O5 that is isostructural with the JT-inactive BiMn2O5 discussed above. The latter observation confirms that a depletion in the strength of the JT effect causes the disproportionation to cease. Furthermore, the conversion of 100% of MnO6 octahedra in the La0.89Mn3+ 0.67Mn4+ 0.33O3 to LaMn3+Mn4+O5 with 50% Mn3+O5 square pyramids and 50% Mn4+O6 octahedra clearly demonstrates the process of oxide protonation, H2O removal, and Mn3+ oxidation, in accordance with the proposed mechanism. The marokite CaMn2O4 with JT-active Mn3+ also disproportionates into ε-MnO2, as shown in Figure S6. Other ions of the first-row transition metals with a strong JT effect is also shown here to undergo H+-induced disproportionation reaction, including Fe4+ (high spin, t2g 3eg 1), Ni3+ (low spin, t2g 6eg 1), and Cu2+ (t2g 6eg 3). However, unlike Mn4+, the high redox potential of the oxidation products for the above cations, in general, does not allow isolation of the solid oxide in the presence of water, as O2 evolution occurs. The disproportionation of JT-active iron is demonstrated with perovskite CaFe4+O3 (Figure 6a), for which Mössbauer spectroscopy has verified a formal 4+ charge on iron at temperatures above 290 K, while macroscopic charge ordering mediated by O 2p ligand holes is dominant at lower temperatures.45 The acid treatment of CaFeO3 quickly proceeds to solid dissolution through O2 evolution, leading to the emergence of an intense pink color in the solution. The UV−vis absorption spectrum of the solution shows the characteristic vibronic progression associated with the ligand-to-metal charge transfer of the tetrahedral ferrate (Fe6+O4 2−) species (Figure 6b).46 The oxidation confirms the acid-induced disproportionation of JT-active Fe4+ species. However, unlike Mn3+, Fe4+ oxidation occurs through a two-electron process accompanied by the removal of two oxide ligands from the FeO6 coordination Figure 5. (a, b) Acid-induced disproportionation of the orthorhombic perovskite La0.955Mn3+ 0.86Mn4+ 0.14O3 yields a complete conversion to εMn4+ 2O4 and a trace of rocksalt MnO.

Soc. 2020, 142, 21122−21130 21127 environment of CaFeO3, yielding the highest possible oxidation state achievable for iron in a condensed phase. Concerning the compounds of nickel, LiNi3+O2 is also JTactive with a noncooperative lattice distortion.47 The acid treatment induces disproportionation, as reported previously.20 Figure 7a shows the evolution of the solution potential measured in situ, as LiNiO2 is subjected to the acid. The solution potential increases rapidly from 0.60 V (vs SHE) to 1.40 V upon the addition of acid, followed by a gradual increase to 1.75 V over 4 h, which dwells for about 30 h before falling to 1.20 V. The +1.75 V measured solution potential during the disproportionation is close to the +1.80 V reported for the Ni4+/2+ couple,48 indicating the release of the highvalent Ni4+ species into the solution. An analysis of the solid nickel oxide after acid treatment with XRD and magnetic susceptibility measurement suggests extensive oxidation of Ni centers. Figure 7b shows the XRD pattern of the resultant NiO2, which can be indexed into a monoclinic, distorted layered lattice reminiscent of the CuBr2 structure type.49 The adverse crystal structure change and reduction of the NiO2 layer spacing from 4.73 Å in the pristine LiNiO2 to 4.32 Å in NiO2 indicate the severity of oxidative delithiation as a result of disproportionation. Figure 7c exhibits the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements of the pristine LiNiO2 and the disproportionation product. The sharp fall in the maximum molar susceptibility in NiO2 can be assigned to the scattered moments diluted by the diamagnetic Ni4+ (t2g 6eg 0) ion. The paramagnetic effective moment is significantly higher than the expected value of zero for the diamagnetic Ni4+, indicating the presence of magnetic ions (Ni2+, Ni3+) in the NiO2 framework and a possible contribution from the orbital angular momentum. Furthermore, a drastic change in the ferromagnetic ordering (θ > 0) in the pristine LiNiO2 to an antiferromagnetic ordering (θ < 0) in NiO2 indicates disruption of the interlayer magnetic interactions.50 Other JT-active oxides containing Ni3+ ion in the octahedral environment are also shown to undergo acid-induced disproportionation. The hexagonal perovskite LaNi3+O3 (100% of Ni in the 3+ state and Oh environment), which is also a ligand-hole-stabilized JT-active oxide,51 and the mixed state Sr1.286Ni+3.428O3 (40% of Ni in the 3+ state and Oh environment) proceed to disproportionation and generation of high-valent Ni4+ as expected. However, in both cases, the resultant Ni4+ reacts immediately with H2O, leading to rapid O2 evolution and complete dissolution of the solids within a few minutes (Video S1 and Video S2). The identity of the evolved gas during the acid treatment of Sr1.286Ni+3.428O3 has been confirmed to be O2 by using a home-built O2 detector (Figure S7c). Finally, the disproportionation of JT-active Cu2+ is discussed in the same framework as other JT-active cations with a distorted octahedral environment. However, because of the severity of JT distortion, the two apical ligands are absent from the immediate Cu2+ coordination environment, reducing the symmetry to square-planar (D4h local symmetry). The emergence of the strongly antibonding, half-filled HOMO with dx 2−y 2 character in the D4h square-planar CuO4 fragment is the leading cause of Cu2+ disproportionation under H+ exposure (Figure S8). A discussion based on MO can reveal that Cu2+ →Cu3+ oxidation stabilizes the system by a removal of the half-filled antibonding HOMO electron. However, the high redox potential associated with the Cu3+ ion leads to a rapid oxidation of H2O into O2, as can be seen by treating CuO with sulfuric acid (Video S3) and confirmed via the oxygen detector (Figure S7d). In discussing the disproportionation of JT-active Fe and Ni-based oxides and the resultant O2 evolution, one may assign O2 release to the oxidation of the H2O by the high-valent Fe4+ and Ni3+ ions in the pristine state and not necessarily to the higher-valent Ni4+ and Fe6+ species generated via a disproportionation process. However, this seems not to be the case as the pristine phases are fairly stable in neutral or basic aqueous solutions. For example, CaFeO3 has been synthesized natively via a hydrothermal reaction (see the Experimental Section). Furthermore, Sr1.286NiO3 was washed with large amounts of water prior to the acid treatment to remove the KOH flux used during the synthesis. In summary, the O2 evolution for the JT-active Fe-, Ni-, and Cu-based oxides is evident only upon the addition of the H+ to water, which verifies the H+-coupled electron-transfer nature of the disproportionation reaction. ■CONCLUSIONS Through exemplary analyses and a revamp mechanism, we have shown that the first-row transition-metal ions under a strong Jahn−Teller effect undergo disproportionation in the presence of H+ through a coupled acid−base/redox reaction. Chemically, the oxidation reaction is driven mainly by the Figure 7. (a) Evolution of the liquid-phase solution potential as the layered LiNi3+O2 undergoes H+-induced disproportionation.

It is essential to note that the propensity of the disproportionation reaction fundamentally depends only on the electronic structure instability (odd occupancy of the doubly degenerate eg orbital set in the idealized Oh symmetry) and the presence of H+ ions (acid). Therefore, despite that concentrated acidic aqueous solutions (Arrhenius H3O+ acid) are used here to demonstrate the concept with various JT-active oxides, it follows that the disproportionation reaction should, in principle, occur in nonaqueous media as well with Brønsted H+ acid present, such as those encountered in lithium-ion batteries. Because of the lower concentration of H+ ions in nonaqueous environments, such as that in lithium-ion batteries, the kinetics of the reactions would be slowed considerably. This calls for a systematic study of the disproportionation reaction of JT-active TMOs in nonaqueous media. Such fundamental studies can provide directions to control performance degradation in electrochemical systems, such as lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the collective knowledge gained from the disproportionation reaction mechanism can guide the synthesis of metastable oxide phases with unusually high oxidation states and/or atomic arrangements with unique electronic and ionic properties, enabling a variety of technological applications. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * sı Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c10044.

Cationic ordering was known previously for M = Mg and Zn, resulting in a superstructure with primitive cubic symmetry. Given the poor chemical contrast of X-ray diffraction between Mn and Ti, Co, Ni, Cu or Ga, neutron diffraction studies were carried out. Evidence of cation ordering is found for M = Ni and Cu, but not for Ti, Co or Ga. These results are confirmed by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Doubly-substituted samples (Li0.5M0.5)[Mn1.5M0.5]O4 (overall formula LiMn3M2O8) were also prepared for M = Mg and Zn. These do not form the primitive superstructure, a result ascribed to the lower manganese valence with respect to LiMn1.5M0.5O4. Zncontaining spinels give rise to an extensive Li/Zn cation inversion, which also shows up as additional high-frequency bands in IR and Raman spectroscopies. This investigation shows that the cell volume is determined by the average octahedral-site cation radius, and that the main driving force for octahedral cation ordering is the charge difference between Mn and M atoms. 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Introduction The mixed oxide LiMn2O4 is a normal spinel with space group Fd3m (at room temperature), containing lithium on tetrahedral 8a sites and manganese on octahedral 16d sites. It is one of the major candidates for positive electrode materials in lithium batteries [1,2], due to its ability to insert or extract lithium with a theoretical capacity of 148 mAh/g on both lithium insertion and extraction. However, its practical use is hindered by capacity fading, especially at high temperature [3], due to (i) the presence of a cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion when the Mn3+ fraction exceeds 50%, (ii) structural instability in the high delithiation range. One of the main routes considered to reduce this fading is partial substitution of manganese by transition metals M, which has been thoroughly studied, especially for M = Cr, Co, Ni [4–6]. Such doping increases the manganese valence v(Mn) in the spinel phase, thus reducing the risk to reach * Corresponding author. E-mail address: strobel@grenoble.cnrs.fr (P. Strobel). the 50% Mn3+ fraction. But it also reduces the intrinsic capacity on lithium extraction, which is proportional to 4v(Mn). On the other hand, the presence of M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni or Cu gives rise to an extra plateau at high potential due to the oxidation of the dopant M and gives interest to compositions with relatively high substitution levels [7]. An especially interesting stoichiometry is LiMn1.5M0.5O4 (or Li2Mn3MO8), where the replacement of exactly 1/4 of the manganese yields tetravalent Mn only if M is divalent. On the basis of available X-ray diffraction data, most electrochemical studies on such substituted materials assumed a random substitution of M on the manganese (16d) sites. However, the 3/4–1/4 ratio can favour an ordering of the 16d cations, as in the known compounds Li2Mn3MgO8 [8] and Li2Mn3ZnO8 [9]. In the latter case, the ordering was recently found to depend on preparation conditions [10]. Cation ordering has also been predicted from ab initio studies for most dopants [11,12]. For Li2Mn3NiO8, conflicting results exist in the literature, with both unordered and ordered phases cited in ICSD [13–15]. Evidence of local ordering by infrared spectroscopy [16] and by MAS-NMR [17] 1293-2558/03/$ – see front matter 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

In this work, we investigate a number of LiMn1.5M0.5O4 compounds containing various M species with valences ranging from +2 to +4. Using neutron diffraction and vibration spectroscopies, we will show that compositions are indeed ordered for M = Ni and Cu, whereas the chemical contrast in X-ray diffraction is too weak to establish this by Xray diffraction. The general trends of random vs. ordered 16d site occupation in Li2Mn3MO8 spinels as a function of M charge and size will be discussed. 2. Experimental Samples were prepared by solid state reaction using lithium carbonate, highly divided manganese dioxide and appropriate oxides or carbonates of substituting element (Mg, Ti, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn or Ga). Among possible trivalent substituents, aluminum was discarded because previous attempts showed synthesis difficulties: solid state reactions in the Li–Mn–Al–O system produce very stable LiAlO2, which is practically impossible to eliminate once formed [18]. Mixtures were ground together and heated repeatedly at 750–900 ◦C in air with intermittent re-grinding and furnace cooling until the X-ray patterns did not change anymore. For compositions studied by neutron diffraction, quantities in the range 10–15 g were prepared. Details for the synthesis for M = Mg, Co, Ni and Cu have been reported previously [18,19]. Fired samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam monochromator and operating with Cu Kα radiation. Counting times higher than 20 s/step were systematically used to provide good statistics for Rietveld refinements. Neutron diffraction (ND) was carried out at Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France, using the powder diffractometers D2B (λ = 1.5940 Å) or D1B (λ = 1.2806 Å), on 10–15 g samples loosely packed in vanadium cylindrical cans. Structural refinements were carried out using the Rietveld method with the WinplotR/Fullprof package [20]. Bond valence sums were calculated using the VaList program [21]. Infrared spectra were recorded on pellets prepared by diluting 1 mg sample in 150 mg TlBr; the powders were mixed and pressed under 8 tons/cm2. The apparatus was a Nicolet 710 FTIR spectrometer used in transmission mode with a resolution of ±2 cm−1. The mirror velocity of the interferometer was reduced to 20 cycles/min to increase the beam intensity; 200 accumulations were carried out to record well resolved spectra. For Raman spectroscopy, pellets of 10 mg sample dispersed in 200 mg KBr and carefully grinded before were pressed under 8 tons/cm2. Spectra were recorded on a JobinYvon T64000 spectrometer with typical acquisition time one hour.The radiation used was supplied by a Spectra Physics RM 20-18 laser operating at 514.5 nm with a 0.8 mW power. 3. Results 3.1. Composition and X-ray diffraction analysis Table 1 summarizes the formulas of all samples, abbreviations used, and experimental studies carried out on each of them. LiMn1.5M0.5O4 compositions were prepared with the following cation charge combinations: Mn+3.33/M+4 (M = Ti), Mn+3.67/M+3 (Ga, Co) and Mn+4/M+2 (all other substituents). In the cobalt case, the charge distribution Mn+3.67/Co+3 (rather than Mn+4/Co+2) was established from magnetic susceptibility measurements [19]. Such a charge assignment has been confirmed by numerous studies on Mn–Co spinels [22–25]. Throughout this paper, LiMn1.5M0.5O4 samples will be abbreviated according to the M element present, e.g. “Mg” for LiMn1.5Mg0.5O4 (see Table 1). Two compositions with double substitution were also prepared, with M replacing simultaneously 0.5 Mn and 0.5 Li. This corresponds to a Li0.5Mn1.5MO4 overall formula (see Table 1, last two lines). Such compositions were prepared for substituents with weak octahedral preference in spinels, to avoid complex cation distributions in the resulting products [26,27], i.e. M = Mg and Zn (labeled “Mg-d” Table 1 AMn1.5M0.5O4 samples nominal composition, nomenclature and techniques used Sample abbrev.

By modifying the charge on the Li (8a) site, this allows to vary the manganese valence v(Mn) while keeping the octahedral site contents (Mn1.5M0.5) unchanged. Fig. 1 shows the XRD diagrams of samples prepared. Phase-pure compounds were obtained for all but the Ga and Ni samples, which contained very minor amounts of LiGa5O8 and NiO, respectively. For M = Cu, two samples were actually made: Cu1 (small batch) with negligible impurities, and Cu2 (large batch) containing a significant fraction of unreacted CuO; this could not be eliminated in the large quantity batch which had to be used for neutron diffraction. These impurities were taken into account in subsequent structure refinements by the Rietveld method. Apart from impurities, significant differences can be seen throughout this series in Fig. 1. Firstly, the intensity of the 220 reflection (near 31 degrees 2θ) is strong for the Zncontaining samples, weak for Mg-d, and very weak but present for Cu, Ga and Ti. The intensity of this reflection is entirely due to the contribution of the 8a site scatterer, so that its presence reflects heavy atom occupation of the tetragonal 8a site. This is expected in Mg-d and Zn-d; in Fig. 2. Low-angle portion of neutron diffraction patterns of samples Co, Ni and Cu2. Arrows = primitive cubic cell reflections. the other samples, it shows evidence of slight (Cu, Ga Ti) to strong (Zn) cation inversion between lithium and the M atom. Secondly, additional reflections are clearly present in the Mg and Zn samples—but, remarkably, not in Mg-d and Zn-d. They are all indexable in primitive cubic unit cells resulting from cation ordering, P4332 for Mg and P213 for Zn. Such extra reflections indicating cation ordering are not observed in the other samples. 3.2. Neutron diffraction and structural refinements The differences in coherent neutron scattering lengths between manganese (−3.73 fm) and the neighbouring transition metal elements (Co: +2.50, Ni: +10.3, Cu: +7.72 fm) [28] allow to show experimentally whether or not these cations order on the octahedral sites. The results (see Fig. 2) clearly show the presence of superstructure reflections for M = Ni and Cu, and not for M = Co, Ga or Ti. Structural refinements were carried out from powder diffraction data using pseudo-Voigt profiles. Final Rietveld refinements from neutron diffraction data included the following variables: (i) global parameters: zero-shift correction, 4 background polynomial coefficients, (ii) profile parameters for each phase detected: scale factor, unit cell parameters, profile parameters U, V , W and η, (iii) structural parameters (refined for the main spinel phase only): atomic positions, isotropic displacement parameters Biso, cation occupancies on the 8b and 4c sites (the 12d site, occupied by the only small cation, namely Mn4+, is not expected to give rise to mixed occupation). Because of expectable strong corre1012 P. Strobel et al. / Solid State Sciences 5 (2003) 1009–1018 Fig. 3.

Differences Iobs −Icalc are shown at the bottom. lations, occupancies and Biso parameters were refined separately, then Biso of the atoms with variable occupation fixed in the final stages of refinements.This strategy resulted in 24 and 32 variables for samples Ni and Cu. Complete observed and calculated neutron diffraction patterns are given in Fig. 3. Structural results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, including Mg and Zn-containing samples, for which X-ray P. Strobel et al. / Solid State Sciences 5 (2003) 1009–1018 1013 data were used. The refinements confirmed the presence of a slight cation inversion for Ti (10%) and Ga (7%), while none was found for Co. The Ni and Cu phases clearly show an ordering of octahedral cations into 4b and 12d sites in space group P4332. Both contain small (Ni) or large (Cu) fractions of lithium on the 4b site (see Table 3). In the latter case, the statistics were significantly improved by including also a fraction of Li2MnO3. Given the multiphase character of these two samples, no constrain on the total Ni or Cu content was used in the refinements. The under-stoichiometry in Cu and Ni found is consistent with the presence of unreacted NiO or CuO. Superstructure lines are weaker for Cu, due to (i) its smaller Fermi length difference with respect to Mn, (ii) partial Li/Cu inversion, which results in a ca. 50% lithium occupation of the octahedral Cu 4b site. Note that cation inversion has been observed previously in a number of Cu2+-containing spinels, where it can be dependent on the sample annealing history [29]. Regarding the Mg and Zn phases, for which cation ordering was found previously [8–10], it is worth noting the difference in space group (P4332 for Mg, P213 for Zn), which shows up in the X-ray diffraction pattern by the presence of additional reflections in the latter case (see Fig. 1). This symmetry difference is due to the strong tetrahedral preference of Zn2+, which results in Li–Zn cation inversion, hence an additional 1:1 cation ordering on the tetrahedral sites which further lowers the symmetry. The structural formula of the Zn sample is then (Li0.5Zn0.5)[Mn1.5Li0.5]O4, and the octahedral site substituent is actually lithium. This inversion effect also occurs in the Zn-d sample, for which the Rietveld refinement gives the cation distribution (Zn0.83Li0.17)[Mn1.5Li0.33Zn0.17]O4. Note that the two Li0.5Mn1.5MO4 doubly-substituted samples differ considerably from the LiMn1.5M0.5O4 Mg and Zn samples: they show no evidence of ordering, and have much larger cell dimensions than the correspondingLiMn1.5M0.5O4 phases. 3.3. Infrared spectroscopy Spinel-type compounds give rise to four T1u infrared active modes [16,30]. As shown in Fig. 4a, the most intense of these in LiMn2O4 are two broad bands ν1 and ν2 at ca. 610 and 500 cm−1, in agreement with the literature [31–33]. The third (ν3) band is observed as weak shoulder on the lowenergy side of the ν2 one at 435 cm−1. Figs. 4b and 4c show that these bands are practically unchanged for M = Ti, Ga and Co, confirming the absence of Mn/M cation ordering in these compounds. For nickel substitution (Fig. 4d), FTIR shows a dramatic increase in the number of infrared active modes, in agreement with previous results [16]. This feature is readily explained by group theory analysis, which predicts an increase from 4 to 21 infrared active modes when the symmetry decreases from Fd3m to P4332 [34]. The Co–Ni comparison illustrates the power of vibration spectroscopy in determinTable 2 Summary of Rietveld refinements results on AMn1.5M0.5O4 samples Sample A M Data Global refinement Spinel phase results useda parameters Rwp χ2 Space group a (Å) x(O) RBragg Structural formula (...)tet [...]oct Mn Li Mn N 4.9 11.4 Fd3m 8.2449(2) 0.2632(3) 3.44 Li [Mn2] O4 + 3% Li2MnO3b (297 K) Ti Li Ti X 7.5 3.0 Fd3m 8.3039(2) 0.2626(2) 2.64 (Li0.90Ti0.10) [Mn1.50Ti0.40Li0.10] O4 Ga Li Ga X 13.7 4.5 Fd3m 8.2110(1) 0.2628(2) 2.30 (Li0.93Ga0.07) [Mn1.50Ga0.43Li0.07] O4 + 7% LiGa5O8b Co Li Co X 11.5 1.73 Fd3m 8.1379(2) 0.2629(2) 2.22 Li [Mn1.50Co0.50] O4 Ni Li Ni N 5.26 28.9 P 4332 8.1667(2) c 5.17 Li [Mn1.50Ni0.44Li0.06] O4 + 1.6% NiOb Cu2 Li Cu N 8.7 7.5 P 4332 8.1888(2) c 7.7 (Li0.90Cu0.10) [Mn1.50Cu0.24Li0.26] O4 + 6.2% CuO, 6.2% Li2MnO3b Mg Li Mg X 15.4 1.37 P 4332 8.1869(4) c 3.34 Li [Mn1.50Mg0.50] O4 Zn Li Zn X 9.88 0.89 P 213 8.1824(2) c 4.30 (Zn0.50Li0.50) [Mn1.50Li0.50] O4 Mg-d Li0.5Mg0.5 Mg X 10.1 2.7 Fd3m 8.2794(2) 0.2623(2) 2.68 (Li0.50Mg0.50) [Mn1.50Mg0.50] O4 Zn-d Li0.5Zn0.5 Zn X 6.13 1.39 Fd3m 8.2678(2) 0.2607(4) 2.05 (Zn0.83Li0.17) [Mn1.50Li0.33Zn0.17] O4 a X = X-rays, N = neutrons (D2B for Mn and Cu, D1B for Ni—hence high χ2 value). b Mass fraction of foreign phase(s) from Rietveld refinement. c Multiple sites—see details in Table 3 (Ni, Cu), Ref.

FTIR also gives valuable information on the Li–Mn–Mg– O and Li–Mn–Zn–O systems. In the former, the infrared spectrum of LiMn1.5Mg0.5O4 was known to be fully consistent with cation ordering and cubic P symmetry [16]. We investigated here the Mg-d composition, for which no superstructure was detected in XRD in spite of a very similar composition and strong Mg–Mn chemical contrast. Its FTIR spectrum (Fig. 4e) indeed confirm the absence of additional vibration bands, meaning that an octahedral (Mn1.5Mg0.5) composition is not a sufficient condition to induce cation ordering. This point will be addressed in the discussion below. In the Li–Mn–Zn–O series, the Zn-d composition gives rise to two additional IR peaks at 583 and 685 cm−1 (see Fig. 4f). These features can be attributed to the peculiar cation distribution revealed by XRD in this sample. The occurrence of extra infrared bands due to distribution changes involving cations with different masses has been reported previously; in particular, the high-frequency feature has been assigned to changes in tetrahedral site composition [35,36]. It is clearly visible at 680 cm−1 in the Zn-d sample, where the tetrahedral site is occupied mostly by the heaviest atom, here Zn (see Fig. 4f). 3.4. Raman spectroscopy Raman spectra of samples Mn, Ga, Co, Ni and Zn-d are shown in Fig. 5. Normal spinels are characterized by a strong doublet at 590–630 cm−1, with additional weaker bands at lower frequency. The five Raman-active modes expected for space group Fd3m are listed in Table 4, together with experimental results. In a localised vibration analysis, the strongest A1g band is viewed as the stretching of the 16dsite cation–oxygen bond [33,38]. For LiMn2O4, the rather large bandwidth of the main doublet can be ascribed to local lattice distortions resulting from the presence of mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ valence on this site [38]. The Ga sample shows an almost unchanged spectrum (Fig. 5b), while in the cobalt case (Fig. 5c), the intensities of the T2g(3) and A1g bands are reversed, but without any additional band. The intensity reversal in the cobalt case can be due to (i) a significant difference in Raman scattering crosssection of the Co–O vibration, as in the case of chromiumdoped LiMn2O4 [39], (ii) a small-polaron conductivity effect involving Co3+/Mn3+–Co2+/Mn4+ couples; such an effect cannot take place in the gallium case. As in the infrared spectrum, the Ni sample gives a very different spectrum with much sharper lines resulting from the symmetry lowering (Fig. 5d). The sharpness of the Raman bands can be seen as a signature of well separated, ordered Ni and Mn sites with integer valence distribution as in formula (Li1+)2(Mn4+)3(Ni2+)O8. Note that in a recent Raman investigation of the LiMn2−xNixO4 solid solution, a splitting of the main Raman doublet was also reported for x = 0.5, and for this composition only [40]; no structural explanation was proposed. For the Zn-d sample, additional modes are also observed (Fig. 5e). The charge distribution is more complex in this case, with a significant fraction of heavy atom (Zn) occupying the tetrahedral 8a site (see Table 2, last line). This is the probable origin of the new feature at 700 cm−1; similar high-frequency features have been observed on inverse spinels such as V[LiNi]O4 [41]. The splitting of the main doublet, which resembles that observed for nickel substitution, shows that there is a local lattice distortion in the 16d sites, leading to a loss of translation invariance. Li+ and Zn2+ actually have larger octahedral ionic radii than Ni2+ [42]. The absence of long-range cation ordering in Znd, contrary to the Ni sample, can be due to the fact that LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 and Li0.5Mn1.5ZnO4 differ considerably not only in cation distribution, but also in manganese valence (+4 in Ni sample, +3.67 in Zn-d). This point will be addressed in the discussion below. Finally, the frequencies of Mn–O vibrations depends on bond lengths and strengths, hence on the oxidation state of manganese. Table 4 shows a clear shift in Raman P. Strobel et al. / Solid State Sciences 5 (2003) 1009–1018 1015 Fig. 4. FTIR spectra of selected substituted LiMn1.5M0.5O4 (M indicated). band frequencies between one group comprising trivalent substituents (Ga3+ and Co3+ (and Mn3+ as well), and a second group with divalent substituents Ni2+ and Zn2+, which give higher frequencies of the T2g and A1g modes. 4. Discussion—structural trends Table 2 shows that this work made available a wide range of manganese oxide spinels with cell parameter ranging from 8.138 to 8.304 Å, corresponding to substituents M with ionic radii from 0.525 (low-spin Co3+) to 0.74 (Zn2+) [42]. Bond distances and bond valence sums have been calculated (see Table 5). This allows to draw crystal chemical trends regarding the factor(s) determining (i) the cell dimensions, (ii) the occurrence of 1:3 16d-site cation ordering. Note that in calculating valence differences, Table 5 takes into account cation distribution inversion as evidenced from structural refinements: for instance the substituent on the octahedral site in the Zn-d sample is actually lithium, not zinc. Focusing first on the cell parameter and 16d site–O distance, an examination of Table 5 shows that their values reflect the influence of two main factors: the substituent cationic radius r(M) and the manganese valence v(Mn). The fact that the cell parameter a decreases when a fraction of manganese is replaced by a larger cation such as Mg, Ni 1016 P. Strobel et al. / Solid State Sciences 5 (2003) 1009–1018 Fig. 5.

However, the scattering in a values obtained for v(Mn) = 3.67 (see Table 5) shows that the manganese valence alone is not sufficient to determine a and d(16d– O). In fact, the best correlation is obtained using the average ionic radius on the 16d site r⟨16d⟩, as shown in Fig. 6. This could be expected, since r⟨16d⟩includes the contributions of r(M) (for 25%) and of r(Mn), which in turn depends on v(Mn). This correlation confirms a previous report including M = Al, Co and Ti only [43]. The highest deviations are observed for the Zn samples, which have a more complex cation distribution. This figure also confirms the charge distribution in the cobalt case: low-spin Co3+ is the smallest cation in this series and gives the lowest a and d(16d–O) values.

Variation of cell parameter a and average octahedral site–oxygen distance d(16d–O) with average ionic radius of octahedral cation in the LiMn1.5M0.5O4 series. been expected for a Co2+–Mn4+ distribution, since Co2+, expected in high-spin configuration, has an octahedral ionic radius (0.74 Å) as large as those of Cu2+ or Zn2+ [42]. Turning now the occurrence of cation ordering, Table 5 shows that this effect seems to be related to the presence of large ionic radius substituents, which also correspond to the largest valence difference v(Mn–M) ⩾2. However, neither Mg-d nor Zn-d obey this trend, in spite of the large size of the substituent. These doubly-substituted samples differ from their LiMn1.5M0.5O4 counterparts mostly by a lower manganese valence (+3.67 instead of +4). This results in (i) a lower valence difference v(Mn–M), (ii) a lower size difference, since a lower v(Mn) induces an increase in Mn– O bond length. We can thus conclude that cation ordering in this series requires (i) a large size difference, (ii) tetravalent manganese. The separation of Mn and larger M atoms in distinct sites in space group P4332 (or P213) allows to place the larger M atoms in bigger 4b sites (with M–O distances in the range 2.03–2.09 Å, and at the same time to reduce the cell volume: Table 5 shows that all cation-ordered phases have cell parameters smaller than the Fd3m ones (with the exception of the cobalt phase), in spite of the presence of larger substituents. The net result is thus a significant optimization of space occupation. The largest size and valence difference is observed in the Zn sample, where the octahedral site substituent is actually lithium: this compound follows the trend outlined here, and yields the largest difference between the Mn–O and M–O distances (see Table 5, last line). Finally, bond valence sum (BVS) have been calculated for all phases (see Table 5, last three columns). This factor is relevant for detecting implausible structures or strains on given atomic sites [44]. Among the unordered phases, the calculated BVS values exhibit significant valence shifts starting from the gallium case, indicating strains in the structure. This applies especially to the Mg-d and Zn-d phases, 1018 P. Strobel et al. / Solid State Sciences 5 (2003) 1009–1018 where the large calculated v(BVS) for Mg and Zn indicate that these cations are under considerable compressive strain in their crystallographic site. As a consequence,the BVS calculation also gives too small manganese v(BVS). The splitting of octahedral sites among 12d and 4b sites in the P4332 (or P213) space group allows to considerably relax these strains, as shown by the values for the Mg and Zn samples. The BVS values are in excellent agreement with expected valences in the nickel case. For Cu2, the agreement is only fair, probably due to the partial Li/Cu inversion and local Jahn–Teller distortion of the Cu2+ ion. 5. Conclusions The present study addresses the question of cation ordering in Li–Mn–O spinels with 1/4 substitution on the octahedral sites. To overcome the inability of XRD to detect such ordering when the cations involved have undistinguishable scattering powers, neutron diffraction was used. This unambiguously showed the occurrence of octahedra site ordering for Ni and Cu substitution, while trivalent substituents (Ga, Co) or compositions with unsufficient charge difference between Mn and the substituting atom do not give rise to octahedral cation ordering. These results are confirmed by vibration spectroscopy (infrared and Raman), which clearly shows symmetry lowering in substituted spinels as a function of substituent. 6. Note added in proof At the time of submitting this manuscript, we became aware of another structural study of the Li–Mn–Ni–O system [45]. Their results from neutron diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy for composition Mn1.5Ni0.5O4 fully agree with the data presented here, (including also the presence of NiO impurity in the sample obtained).

The morphology showed that important differences exist between two sets of materials: A-type materials prepared with a deficiency of LiOH with respect to the LiMnO, stoichiometric composition and B-type materials prepared with an excess of LiOH. Bulk density variations were interpreted in terms of the occurrence of several lithium and/or manganese salt impurities. From Rietveld refinements, and contrary to the previously described LiMnO, structures, the present LiMnO, samples exhibit a cationic disorder on the lithium and manganese sites, with occupancy variations ranging from 3 to 12%. Finally, the frequently occurring abnormal widening of the second diffraction line could be modelled and attributed to the mixing of a regular diffraction peak of the phase under study [the (1 10) reflection] and of some poorly crystallized unreacted Mn203. These structural results can be used to explain the electrochemical behaviour of the samples when employed as cathodes in rechargeable lithium batteries. Over the last 20 years, the LiMnO, phases have been the subject of many studies because, like LiNiO, and LiCoO,, they are very active cathodic materials, often used in rechargeable electrochemical lithium batteries. The intense research on the manganese phases has also been motivated because manganese is non-toxic and its oxides are cheap. In addition, Mn presents the advantage of exhibiting the oxidation state IV in MnO,, allowing for good stabilization of the oxidized LiMnO,. The search for electrochemically highly reactive phases led many groups to imagine new soft chemistry ways to prepare manganese dioxides (with or without lithium). So, a new lowtemperature (300 < T/"C <450) synthesis of orthorhombic LiMnO, was implemented by Ohzuku et al.' It consisted of heating a pressed pellet of an equimolecular mixture of manganite (y-MnOOH) and lithium hydroxide ( LiOH.H,O) under nitrogen for 15 h. More recently, Reimers et a1.' proposed an improvement of the Ohzuku method. They showed that LiMnO, could be readily prepared at very low temperature (100 "C) through an ion-exchange reaction. The compounds synthesized at higher temperatures (T/ > 450 "C) generally present electrochemical capacities smaller than the phases obtained at low temperature. The improved electrochemical properties of the low-temperature phases have been tentatively attributed to disorder (ie. to stacking faults), a characteristic which would be responsible for the poor crystallization state of the phases [wide diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) diagrams]. A highertemperature synthesis (600 < T/"C < 620) has been used by Gummow et aL3 to prepare an orthorhombic LiMnO,. The phase was prepared under argon from a mixture of y-MnO, and LiOH, with carbon as a reducing agent. Poor electrochemical reactivity led to a capacity of only 70 mA h g-' when the phase was put into use in a lithium battery. This result reinforced the idea that high-temperature-prepared LiMnO, materials were not appropriate as cathodic materials for use in lithium rechargeable batteries. However, recently Davidson et aL4 prepared the same orthorhombic lithiummanganese dioxide at high temperature, and, unexpectedly, the phase showed rather elevated specific capacities of about 140 mA h 8-l. The synthesis consists of firing a mixture of b-MnO, and Li,C03 between 600 and 650°C in a first step to eliminate CO,, followed by heating the sample between 800 and 1000 "C under an argon flux. The improved performances have been observed, but not explained. We recently prepared a new high-temperature orthorhombic LiMnO, according to a newly patented pr~cedure.~ Preliminary results have shown that this compound which is used as a cathode in LiMnO,/Li electrochemical systems, presents a mean discharge potential of around 3.5 V, with the best batteries reaching a capacity higher than 160 mA h 8-l with rather good ~yclability.~ Because the phase atomic structure characteristics are believed to be the key to the unexpectedly high electrochemical energy of this new hightemperature-formed manganese oxide, a complete and thorough structural and physical study of LiMnO, has been undertaken. This article reports the full characterization of this phase. LiMnO, Synthesis The synthesis of the orthorhombic LiMnO, phase has been performed by mixing Mn203 (prepared by thermolysis of MnO, under air at 700 "C) and LiOH.H20 (commercial product used as received) in l/ca. 2 proportions. The synthesis consists of successive grindings and heatings at 300, 500 and 700°C. The final temperature of 700°C is maintained for 4 h before allowing the sample to cool slowly to room temperature. The preparation cannot be made under air, because the phase reacts with oxygen to give a mixture of Li2Mn0, and LiMn204. The synthesis was hence performed under an inert gas (argon for instance) or under a mildly reducing atmosphere (nitrogen mixed with hydrogen). The nominal Li/Mn chosen ratios ranged from 0.95 to 1.10 in order to try to obtain various non-stoichiometries around the LiMnO, compositions. This corresponded to two series of samples with Li/Mn < 1 (labelled A) and Li/Mn > 1 (labelled B) totalling six samples in all. The Mn and Li elemental analyses performed on the samples revealed ratios slightly different from the nominal values (Table 1). In addition, redox analyses demonstrated the absence of MnIV and Mn" species, pointing to a LiMnOz stoichiometry in the preparations. Accordingly, Published on 01 January 1995.

Hoppe et aL6 prepared an orthorhombic modification of LiMn02, a material reported to be stoichiometric, with a brown-black colour. The materials prepared according to the above method5 are light-green or black. The light-green colour corresponds to A-type materials and the black colour to the B-type ones. Colour is therefore the first visible criterion that allows the differentiation between the Hoppe phases and some of those of the present study. The differences may originate either in the composition of the phases (departure from LiMnO, stoichiometry) or in a grain size effect, well known, for instance, in pigments. The presence of some impurities (Li,C03, Li,SO, and MnO) was clearly demonstrated in the LiMnO, samples prepared according to ref. 5. MnO was detected by XRD in the materials referenced MN389 and MN384 [revealed through a small peak at the foot of the (011) line (28=35") and another one at 28=59']. The occurrence of lithium sulfate and carbonate was demonstrated by IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The IR spectra show vibrations characteristic of lithium sulfate at 1150 and 1000cm-l and of lithium carbonate at 1490, 1430 and 860 cm-' (Fig. 1). The analysis of C, S, Li and Mn yielded a maximum content of about 0.2 and 4 wt.% for the sulfate and the carbonate, respectively. There was no hydrogen, as also confirmed by the absence of incoherent scattering in the powder neutron diffraction diagrams, which were recorded at the Laboratoire Leon Brillouin (Laboratoire commun CEA-CNRS, Saclay, France).

Physical Characterization Morphology A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study performed with a JEOL 6400F instrument allowed comparison of the Aand B-type materials. The former group presents a homogeneous size distribution of regular, elongated grains, parallelepipedic in shape (Fig. 3). The grain sizes span from ca. 0.2 to 1 pm. The latter group shows (Fig. 4) a large grain size distribution with very ill-defined shapes. Whereas the large grains are embedded within one another, the smaller grains are scattered around the larger ones (diameter of large grains, ca. 10 pm, and of small grains, ca. 1 pm). Thus the larger grains of the B-type samples are about ten times the size of those of the A-type samples. Note that the green samples correspond, as expected, to the smaller grains. Density Density measurements have been made with an automated ACCUPYC 1330 pycnometer. The data show that the A-type samples have very similar densities [identical within three estimated standard deviations (ESD)]. The densities of the B-type materials, notably lower than those of the other group, decrease with the observed Li/Mn bulk ratio (Table 1). Description of the LiMnOz Model Structure The stoichiometric, orthorhombic LiMnO, compound presents a Pmnm space group, with Z=2, Mn and Li being in the 2a special position (on a symmetry element) with an octahedral coordination of oxygen atoms (in the 2b special Fig.2 Differential thermal analysis of sample MN412 showing the fusion of Li,C03 at 723 "C Published on 01 January 1995.

(a) MN389, Fig. 5 shows a projection of the structure along the c axis. The structure is built up from MnO, octahedra sharing apices along the u axis and edges along the c axis, so that the structure exhibits a succession of corrugated (MnO,), and (Li06), slabs. As previously reported by Reimers et aL2 it can be described as a cation superlattice structure of a rock salt structure of MnO. Considering that !ithiurn and mangFnese are similar sized ions (ri(Mniii) = 0.645 A and ritLii) = 0.76 A)7 and that they play a perfectly symmetrical role in the structure, a lithium/ manganese substitution can be envisaged within the hypothesis of cationic disorder. Within the same slab, there could be LiO, and MnO, octahedra simultaneously present. Such a hypothesis has not been considered in the LiMnO, structures published to date.' 4.h X-Ray Diffraction Study of the LiMnO, Phases Characterization of the Powders The X-ray powder diffraction diagrams of the different LiMnO, samples were obtained on a SIEMENS D5000 Fig. 4 Morphology of the B-type samples.

The parameters refined with a full pattern matching program' are given in Table 2 and the XRD diagrams are shown in Fig. 6. The ( 110) reflection (28 = 24.8') is sometimes very wide compared with the other peaks of the diagram (Table 1) and its intensity varies regularly from sample to sample on going from MN389 to MN401. In addition, around 28 = 63', a peak, with (310)/(230) indexing, appears either as a singlet or a doublet. In some phases, the doublet is perfectly separated, but in others not at all (Table l), depending on the crystallite sizes. Clearly, the (1 10) and (310)/(230) diffraction lineshapes give qualitative indications of thz state of crystallinity of the phase. Indeed, as observed by SEM (Fig. 4), larger grains (Btype samples) give a thinner (110) line and a better separation of the (310)/( 230) doublet. Grain Size Anisotropy Because of the non-monotonic variation of the reflection linewidths with 26 for the LiMnO, samples [a problem linked, in particular, to the (110) line at 28=24.8'], the grain size anisotropy was studied by the Warren-Averbach m e t h ~ d . ~ This method has been put in use with the WIN-CRYSIZE software," to allow crystallite size and microstrain determinations. The experimental data necessary for the calculations are the peaks widths at half maximum (FWHM) and the Gaussian-Lorentzian q mixing factors for the sample reflections and those of LaB, used as standard. These data were obtained from the PROFILE program." Table 3 presents the results obtained. The samples MN384 and MN389 are characterized by grain size anisotropy (longer along b), corresponding to the small and well shaped crystals observed by SEM and to the wider diffraction lines (non-separated peak at 28= 63"). In addition, the growth axes of the needle-like crystals (Fig. 3) do correspond to b. For the other materials, the anisotropy is less obvious in agreement with the larger, not so well shaped crystals, with more well resolved XRD patterns. This is in accord with the fact that the samples MN399 and MN401 present grain or crystallite sizes about one order larger than those of MN389, MN384 and MN386. Structure Refinement of the LiMnOz Samples from the Hoppe Model When it proved necessary, i.e. for the MN389 and MN384 samples, the ( 110) reflection (28 z 24.8') was removed from the powder diffraction Rietveld refinement. In effect, the abnormal width of this very intense reflection did not allow for classical Cagliotti linewidth refinement as a function of 28 [( FWHM), = u t 8 8 + vtg8 + w]. As discussed later, this abnormal line is not due to LiMnO, only. This point allowed us to suppress this ill-defined line. In a first step, the XRD data were refined using the Hoppe structural model6 with atomic position 2a for manganese and lithium, and 2b for oxygen. Because the atomic displacement parameters (ADP) were difficult to refine (even Hoppe refinement from single-crystal data led to non-homogeneous ADPs, see Table4 captiop), the isotropic ADYs of the refinements were fixed at 0.5A2 for Mn and 1.00A2 for Li and for 0. (For Mn, the value corresponds to that generally found for this element in single-crystal studies and that for lithium corresponds to the lower value obtained in other similar In the case of oxygen, the calculated Biso values vary wildly from 0.5 to >4.0 A,; an intermediate value bas been chosen, such that a small variation around it (k0.5 A') induced little change in the structural results. Table 4 summarizes the values of the cell parameters and of the atomic positions obtained with this model. Note that the cell volumes are very similar, suggesting that the compounds all present LiMnO, stoichiometry. As the results show, these values are not significantly Table 3 Crystallite size determination obtained with the Warren-Averbach method in the u, b and c directions of the LiMnO, cells (for MN412 the crystallite size cannot be determined by the Warren-Averbach method because it is too highly crystalline) A-type samples B-type samples MN389 MN384 MN386 MN399 MN412 MN401 Published on 01 January 1995.

In effect, certain diffraction regions still remained poorly modelled. Since the lithium and manganese ions have a similar size and fill the same type of octahedral site, Li/Mn substitution was attempted. In such a hypothesis, a single slab will then contain MnO, and LiO, groups and the model will thus correspond to cationic disorder. Structure Refinement with Cationic Disorder Within the frame of cationic disorder, the occupation ratios of lithium and manganese on each site have been refined and normalised with respect to the other cation. Similarly, the substitution rates of Li and Mn on the Mn and Li sites, respectively, have been constrained to be equal. On the same site, the Mn and Li atoms were indeed constrained to have the same atomic positions, with the ADPs fixed at the above values. Table 5 lists the cell parameters, atomic positions and occupation ratios using the disordered model. The reliability factors (Table 5 ) and fitting of the XRD patterns (see Fig. 7 for MN412 as an example) are clearly better with the introduction of Li/Mn substitution. However, it was necessary to check the validity of the procedure, since the improved results could be due simply to the increase in the number of refined parameters. Using the deviance test’ (analogous to the Hamilton test used in single-crystal structure determinations) it is possible to determine whether the lowering of x2 (the goodness-of-fit factor used to evaluate the -2m[, .ma -1 4000 20 40 60 80 100 1 20 28 /degrees Fig. 7 X-Ray powder diffraction Rietveld refinement diagram of sample MN412 taking into account the disorder between lithium and manganese. A satisfactory refinement is achieved for this compound, as well as with all the other LiMnO’ phases (see Table 5). quality of the Rietveld refinement) is to be attributed to an increase in the number of variables or to the amelioration of the structural model. The deviance, D, is defined as follows: where yi and yci are the observed and calculated intensities and N is the number of recorded data points. The deviance thus takes into account the quality of the refinement model and the number of parameters used.

CHEM., 1995, VOL . 5 Q, is defined as: Q = D +uprnax where P,,, is the number of refined parameters and a = 2 or In Pmax.8 The model presenting the lowest Q value is considered the better to describe the structure. The results obtained for the six studied materials (Table 6) show that, with a substantially lower Q value, we are justified in choosing the Li/Mn substitution model to describe the structure of the phases under study. The simultaneous refinement of X-ray and neutron diffraction data later confirmed the cationic disorder. Li/Mn substitution thus appears to be an original characteristic which differentiates the present materials from those previously ~tudied.'-~.~ It has not been possible to prove whether other high-temperature-prepared materials present the same feature. Structural calculations carried out on Hoppe singlecrystal data6 proved inconclusive. Modelling of the Abnormal Reflection Line (110) The superposition of two lines could explain the anomalously wide peak situated at 28 = 24.8'. For instance, one of the lines could be that of the LiMnO, samples themselves, the other possibly being attributable to a badly crystallized impurity. The line has thus been modelled by two peaks using the program PROFILE" for the material MN384. The profile parameters obtained during the XRD data refinement (with the zone around 28=24.8' indeed excluded) allowed the theoretical profile of the (1 10) peak to be modelled. From the difference peakobs -peakcalc, a second peak was obtained (Fig. 8),owhich could correspond to an interatomic distance of 3.58 A, attributable to an Mn-Mn distance in the comTable6 Values of the deviance criteria obtained for the ordered (Q) and disordered (Q') structure arrangements of the LiMnO, phases (see text for a definition of Q) sample Q Q' A-type samples MN389 18000 14200 21 MN384 6100 4840 20 MN386 12300 8050 35 B-type samples MN399 14200 1 1600 MN4 12 6950 6430 MN40 1 12500 11600 18 7 7 200 t pound Mn203, one of the precursors of the synthesis of the LiMnO, samples. The high-temperature phase LiMnO, synthesized by Davidson et aL4 also exhibits the same anomalously wide peak. This kind of preparation does not use Mn,O, as a precursor, but it may be present as an intermediary phase during the reduction of the manganese dioxide. The theoretical density of stoichiometric LiMnO, is 4.213. All the A-type compounds show similar densities within three ESDs, but slightly higher than 4.213. As Li,CO, has been detected in these compounds, one should expect a lower density than the stoichiometrically expected value. Since the phases are, within error, necessarily stoichiometric (see synthesis and structure refinement sections) the only way to explain this discrepancy is to take into account another impurity having a higher density than LiMnO,. This material should be Mn203: it explains the broad line observed in the XRD diagrams and it does not introduce another oxidation state for manganese (only an oxidation state of 111 is found for Mn in all the syntheses). For the B-type materials, the density decreases on going from MN399 to MN401, in accordance with the increase in Li,C03 content and the quasiabsence of Mn203, as observed by XRD. This means that some excess of LiOH is necessary to consume Mn,O, fully; this excess probably plays the role of a melt, favouring crystal growth and explaining the occurrence of the larger single crystals of the B-type samples and their better defined XRD patterns (see above). Conclusion Through various and accurate measurements, it has been possible to demonstrate that the LiMnO, samples prepared at high temperature and under reducing atmospheres do show the same Pmnm space group as previously reported for the LiMnO, compounds. However, whereas these latter materials have been described as ordered compounds, the LiMnO, samples prepared according to ref. 5 exhibit a significant degree of Li/Mn substitution (between 3 and 12%). The disorder introduced to improve the modelling of the powder XRD data is in line with the behaviour of lithium, the size of which allows such a substitution as often observed in oxides. Clearly, the presence of manganese within the lithium sheets may improve the electrochemical behaviour of the disordered materials compared with that of the ordered phases. On the other hand, it is also possible that too high a substitution rate may hamper the lithium diffusion throughout the structure17 and modify the phase-transition mechanism expected upon lithium deintercalation of LiMnO, . Electrochemical studies are at present under way to attempt to link the electrochemical activity (capacity, energy and reversibility) to the stoichiometry, substitution ratio and morphology of this new LiMnO, material.

UNCORRECTED PROOF Stability of LiMn2O4 and new high temperature phases in air, O2 and N2 Vincenzo Massarotti*, Doretta Capsoni, Marcella Bini Dipartimento di Chimica Fisica “M. Rolla” e CSTE-CNR, Universita` di Pavia, viale Taramelli 16, 27100 Pavia, Italy Received 25 January 2002; accepted 8 March 2002 by P. Wachter Abstract We investigate the reversible and irreversible transformations, the Li, Mn spinel undergoes under different atmospheres (air, O2, and N2) when heated up to 1050 8C. In air and O2, a substantial reversible cation exchange occurs. For T $ 800 8C, Mn2þ ions substitute Liþ at the tetrahedral (8a) position, and Liþ shifts to interstitial octahedral (16c) site. Charge balance is achieved by a decrease in the Mn3þ fraction, which is partially reduced to Mn2þ in the regular octahedral (16d) site, according to the charge distribution (Li122y þ Mn2y 2þ)8a[Li3y þ]16c[Mn5y 2þMn125y 3þ Mn1 4þ]16dO4 (y increases with T). Under N2 flow, a first decomposition occurs between 600 and 800 8C and yields Mn3O4, orthorhombic LiMnO2 and O2. A minor O2 release occurs when heating above 900 8C, which is accompanied by the transformation of o-LiMnO2 into a cubic LixMn12xO solid solution ðx # 0:5Þ; consistent with a decrease in the average oxidation state of Mn ions. This cubic phase is stable at high temperature and decomposes upon cooling ðT # 800 8CÞ leaving just the Mn3O4 and o-LiMnO2 phases. q 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction The use of LiMn2O4 as an electrode for rechargeable lithium ion cells was proposed more than 20 years ago [1], and this material was extensively characterised a decade later [2–5]. The current interest in the compound is still more, and is focussing upon new routes of chemical and electrochemical synthesis for both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric spinel phases. Composition-valence ‘phase diagrams’ have been proposed mainly on the basis of mass variation, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data [5–7], and the general formula Li1þyMn22yO4. At low oxygen pressures, a deficit of oxygen occurs in LiMn2O42d, where d was determined as a function of temperature by thermogravimetry (TG) and chemical titration [8,9]. Furthermore, in the range 620 , T , 1100 8C, the oxygen loss and the enthalpy change (from DSC runs) quantitatively agree with the decomposition of the spinel to give Mn3O4 and LiMnO2 [10,11]. Evidence for LiMnO2 phase formation in air comes from in situ XRD measurements of LiMn2O4 in the T-range 960–1080 8C [5]: LiMnO2 and Li2MnO3 coexist. More recently, the role of different preparation routes upon phase transformation and stability has been demonstrated [12,13]. We need a deep understanding of the stability of the spinel phase in order to plan synthesis and sinterisation processes that achieve final composition and structure which are optimal for electrochemistry and catalysis. For a better understanding of the mechanisms of thermal decomposition of the spinel phase, we planned a study of the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 as a function of oxygen partial pressure, in the temperature range 25–1050 8C, by TG and in situ XRD measurements. 2.

Massarotti). UNCORRECTED PROOF amount to boiling propionic acid [14]. After solvent evaporation and drying in vacuum, the powder was treated in air at 500 8C for 18 h, then heated for 18 h at 900 8C (heating and cooling rate of 5 8C/min). The XRD patterns have been collected with a Bruker D5005 diffractometer (Bragg–Brentano geometry, graphite monochromator, Cu Ka radiation). The high temperature patterns were obtained with an HTK1200 Anton Paar polythermal attachment with alumina sample holder. The atmosphere was N2, O2 (flow rate 5 l/h), or air. The patterns have been collected up to 980 8C in O2 and air, and up to 1050 8C in N2. Heating and cooling rate was 0.08 8C/s; the measurements have been performed in the 13 # 2u # 938 angular range. TG measurements were run by means of a 2950 TGA (TA Instruments) controlled by a TA 5000 system (flows and heating cycles as for XRD). The XRD data were analysed by Rietveld method [15], based on the minimisation of the residual: M 1⁄4 X wiðyo;i 2 yc;iÞ2 ð1Þ where yo;i and yc;i are the observed and calculated intensities at point i of the diffraction pattern and wi the pertinent statistical weight. For the case of a system containing p crystalline phases, yc;i can be written as yc;i 1⁄4 yb;i þ X p Kp X h mh;pLh;plFh;pl2Gh;p;iAh;p;i ð2Þ where yb,i is the background intensity contribution, Kp the scale factor related to the mass percentage of the same p phase, mh,p the multiplicity of the reflection, Lh,p the Lorentz-polarisation factor, Fh,p the structure factor, Gh,p,i the peak profile function (Pearson VII), Ah,p,i the peak asymmetry function. For each phase, all the h reflections contributing to the diffracted intensity at point i are considered. The parameters of the multiphase model were refined using the FULLPROF program [16] and a procedure described elsewhere [17]. The relative abundance of phases and occupancies of cation sites have been estimated and the reliability of the results have been evaluated by means of the discrepancy factor Rwp and x 2 [15,16]. 3. Results 3.1. Measurements in air or in O2 flow The XRD patterns collected during a heating/cooling cycle in air are shown in Fig. 1. Similar patterns are obtained during the same cycle in oxygen. In both sets, the cubic LiMn2O4 spinel is the only phase detected up to 980 8C. No evidence for the formation of tetragonal spinel phases at 780 , T , 915 8C [5,10] have been found (inset of Fig. 1). The intensity of the 220 spinel reflection (at 2q < 308) changes above 600 8C. This phenomenon is related to a modified cationic distribution, with Mn ions that, at high temperatures, begin to occupy the Liþ tetrahedral site [5]. This displacement is also related to an increase in the very weak 422 and 620 reflections (at 2q < 54 and 728, respectively, see Fig. 1). Occupancy of the 8a site by Mn is more pronounced in air than in oxygen atmosphere, which suggests that the change in cation distribution is driven by a release of O2. In fact, TG measurements (Fig. 2) confirm that the weight loss upon heating is higher in air than in O2. Both TG and XRD measurements suggest that the process is reversible. The Rietveld structural and profile refinement has been performed assuming a cubic spinel phase. For T . 600 8C, a modified cubic spinel model was applied where a fraction of Mn is placed at the 8a lattice site and a corresponding amount of Li is displaced from 8a site to the neighbouring Fig. 1. XRD patterns of a stoichiometric spinel during a heating/cooling cycle in air. The reflections marked with stars are due to the alumina sample holder. In the inset, the 400 cubic reflection is shown and compared with theoretical positions for the tetragonal cells reported in literature [5,10]. Fig. 2. TG measurements of LiMn2O4 in air, O2 and N2.

The closeness of the 8a and 16c sites, whose polyhedra share a face, may justify lithium shift. This Liþ insertion/migration in a 16c site is strictly related to the transformation occurring in charge/discharge electrochemical processes [18,19]. Some trials have been carried out using an inverse spinel model, proposed for quenched samples [10]: we could not obtain satisfactory fits, in agreement with the results obtained by Thackeray et al. [5]. This may imply that the 16d site is fully occupied by Mn ions even for T $ 800 8C. The Mn amount on 8a site (Mn plus Li occupancy constrained to 100%) increases with temperature. Upon cooling this process is reversible, with some hysteresis. The Li occupancy of the 8a and 16c sites (Li 16c constrained so that 1:2 Li/Mn ratio is achieved), as obtained by fitting the modified spinel model, is shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) as a function of T. The a lattice parameter of the spinel has been evaluated for both air and O2 experiments, and its dependence on T is shown in Fig. 3(c). Satisfactory x 2 (1.30–1.56) and Rwp (22.5–26.2 %) values were obtained. 3.2. Measurements in N2 flow The most significant XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4. The spinel phase is stable up to 600 8C and it does not show any evidence of change in cation distribution for T # 400 8C. At 600 8C, the intensity of the 220 peak (Fig. 4) increases: our refinement yields about 10% of 8a sites occupied by Mn, the same amount attained at 800 8C in air (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Between 600 and 800 8C, LiMn2O4 completely transforms into Mn3O4 and orthorhombic LiMnO2 phases. A weight loss of ,6% is observed (Fig. 2). At 980 8C, we have the 100 reflection of the o-LiMnO2 phase ð2u , 15:58Þ along with a new set of peaks (arrows in Fig. 4), attributed to a cubic lithium manganese oxide phase with a MnO structure. This phase may be produced through a mechanochemical process [20], but was not otherwise observed before. Upon cooling, this phase reverts again to an orthorhombic phase, which is stable down to room temperature and coexists with Mn3O4. An additional set of data was collected during a heating/cooling cycle at 930, 960, 1000, 1050, 800, and 35 8C. At 930 8C, the pattern is fully explained by Mn3O4 and o-LiMnO2. At 960 8C, the orthorhombic to cubic transformation is underway and both phases are present. The 980 8C pattern of the previous set had only the 100 reflection of the orthorhombic phase, but not the other reflections of o-LiMnO2. This fact suggests that, at 980 8C, the orthorhombic to cubic transformation completes in about 30 min. The o-LiMnO2 is not seen in the patterns with Fig. 3. Fractional site occupancy of lithium in the 8a site (a), 16c site (b), and lattice parameters (c) of cubic spinel phase during thermal cycles in different atmospheres as a function of temperature.

Massarotti et al. / Solid State Communications 122 (2002) 317–322 319 UNCORRECTED PROOF T $ 1000 8C. The patterns obtained during cooling are somehow different from those of the previous set, and the differences are believed to be caused by the harder annealing. At 800 8C, in addition to Mn3O4, only the cubic form is present in the second set, and not o-LiMnO2. At 35 8C, we now have a cubic MnO phase in addition to the oLiMnO2 and Mn3O4. The lattice parameters, as given by Rietveld refinement, are plotted vs. T in Fig. 3(c) (spinel phase) and Fig. 5 (oLiMnO2 and cubic lithium manganese oxide). The fractions (in mol%) of Li–Mn oxide are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of temperature. 4. Discussion The spinel phase is stable up to 980 8C in air or O2 atmospheres, whereas an irreversible decomposition takes place between 600 and 800 8C in N2. The lattice expansion increases faster in air than in oxygen for T . 800 8C (Fig. 3(c)), which agrees with the higher a values obtained in quenched samples relative to the slowly cooled ones [10]. The Li occupancy of the 8a site displays a remarkable dependence on the oxygen partial pressure above 800 8C, and decreases with decreasing p(O2) (Fig. 3(a)). However, the electronic density of the site increases, as signalled by the higher intensity of the 220 reflection (Fig. 1), meaning that lithium is substituted by Mn ion. The spinel lattice is preserved (inset of Fig. 1) and oxygen vacancies in the anionic sublattice should not be taken into account in the explored p(O2) range [9]. We have no evidence by Rietveld refinement of Mn substitution by Li ions at 16d site, and we should rule out even the minor (,10%) inversion of spinel suggested by Tarascon et al. [10]. After the thermal cycle, we obtained the same spinel phase as initial one, suggesting the preservation of 1:2 Li/Mn ratio. Therefore, a model is suggested, in which the Liþ ion can be inserted into the octahedral 16c site, contributing to the overall charge balance according to the following equilibrium, valid for y # 0:2 ð1 þ yÞLiMn2O4 X Liþ 122yMn2þ 2y   8a Liþ 3y h i 16c Mn2þ 5y Mn3þ 125yMn4þ 1 h i 16dO4 þ 2yO2 ð3Þ The presence of Mn2þ at 8a site was suggested also by Thackeray et al. [5]. If we assumed only Mn3þ and Mn4þ(and not Mn2þ) at the 16d site, a different kind of charge and mass balance should have been obtained; in particular, we should have had a significant increase in Mn3þ that would contribute to the Jahn–Teller distortion of the spinel structure. Such a tetragonal distortion previously reported [5,10,12,21] has never been observed in our measurements (inset of Fig. 1). With increasing temperature, the y value increases, the mean valence of Mn decreases and oxygen is released, in agreement with the TG results in Fig. 2. At 980 8C in air the mean valence of Mn is 2.83, while the initial value was 3.5 and that of Mn3O4 (tetragonal spinel) is 2.66. This process is reversible, and the high temperature form is re-oxidised, upon cooling, back to the stoichiometric LiMn2O4. In the high temperature ‘cation-rich’ phase, Liþ ion can occupy up to 30% of the interstitial 16c site. Theoretical calculation of defect formation energy in LiMn2O4 at rt shows that Li Frenkel defect (1.65 eV) is strongly preferred with respect to other possible ones [22]. It is well known that the 16c site is involved also for the ‘Li-rich’ Li2Mn2O4 compound, which contains only Mn3þ in a tetragonal structure [7,19]. Instead, the present cation-rich spinel may have lower average valence because of the presence of Mn2þ (Eq. (3)). Thus, at high temperatures, the Mn3þ decreases and the cubic symmetry of the site is preserved. In air, the cation distribution over the spinel 8a site is a function of temperature and basically reversible; at 600 8C a full 8a occupancy by Li is observed (both upon heating and Fig. 5. Lattice parameters of o-LiMnO2 (full circles, heating; open circles, cooling) and cubic LixMn12xO (squares) phases from measurements performed under N2. Fig. 6. Mol percentage of Li–Mn oxide (o-LiMnO2 or cubic LixMn12xO) in comparison with the expected value (Eq. (4)) as a function of temperature for samples treated in N2 flow. V.

The associated mass variation, due to oxygen release according to Eq. (3), would be 1.2% from 600 to 800 8C, in good agreement with the TG data (Fig. 2). Our slow thermal cycling yields results somehow different from those obtained with samples quenched in air [10] or directly synthesised at high temperature [5]. For samples quenched from T . 800 8C, it seems that fast cooling inhibited the equilibrium with O2. For the in situ high temperature measurements [5] the differences may be due to the special experimental setting and the very thin (sprayed) sample analysed. Surface reactions may have occurred at T < 715 8C with the formation of a Li2MnO3 phase, which get transformed at higher temperatures. Different synthesis routes may influence the high temperature stability of the spinel. In effect, different structures and/ or microstructures can be stable at the same annealing temperature, depending on sample preparation [12,23]. In fact, the sample synthesised via sol–gel has morphology and crystallite size different from those of a sample obtained by solid state reaction [11,23]. Under a N2 flow, a modest release of oxygen occurs between 400 and 600 8C indicating that cation mixing has already begun (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). This fact agrees with a higher value of the a parameter for the cubic spinel at 600 8C, which is attained only at 800 8C in air or under O2 (Fig. 3c). In addition, between 600 and 800 8C, the following reaction occurs: 3LiMn2O4 ! Mn3O4 þ 3LiMnO2 þ O2 ð4Þ The amount of LiMnO2 (Fig. 6) is very similar to the value obtained from refinement, assuming the proper multiphase structural model. The complete reaction implies about 6% of oxygen loss, in agreement with the result of TG measurement between 600 and 800 8C (Fig. 2). Mn3O4 is stable over the explored temperature range while LiMnO2 maintains its orthorhombic form only below 930 8C. At higher temperatures ð960 # T # 1050 8CÞ; the cubic solid solution LixMn12xO with x # 0:5 and Mn oxidation state (2 2 x )/(1 2 x ) is created according to the reaction: ð1 2 xÞLiMnO2 ! LixMn12xO þ 0:5ð1 2 2xÞLi2O þ 0:25ð1 2 2xÞO2 ð5Þ The oxygen released is lost in the N2 flow and no longer available for the reverse reaction when cooling. Assuming that the overall weight loss, of about 1.6% (Fig. 2), between <900 and 980 8C is due to release of O2, we would have x < 0:45: The Li2O phase formed (about 3% by weight), was not identified by diffraction, probably because it gives an amorphous segregation. On cooling, the cubic solid solution disappears below 800 8C and oLiMnO2 is observed. The transformation could follow the reaction: LixMn12xO ! ð5x 2 2ÞLiMnO2 þ ð1 2 2xÞMn3O4 þ ð1 2 2xÞLi2O ð6Þ At rt, we finally observe the proportion of phases (Fig. 6) predicted by Eq. (4), confirming that no Li loss occurred during the thermal process. The underestimation of oLiMnO2 for 800 8C $ T $ rt (Fig. 6) could be related to a delayed crystallisation of the orthorhombic form for kinetic reasons. When the sample has been annealed a long time (more than 10 h) at T . 1000 8C, the XRD patterns obtained during cooling show the presence of the cubic form below 800 8C. At rt MnO, Mn3O4 and oLiMnO2 were detected, according to the stabilisation of a lower Mn mean oxidation state. 5. Conclusions In the spinel phase we observed that the 8a site and an interstitial 16c site are involved in reversible changes of ionic distribution occurring at high temperatures in air or O2. Between 800 and 980 8C, lithium progressively occupies an interstitial site and a substantial change in charge distribution involving the Mn ions occurs according to Eq. (3). The average oxidation state of Mn decreases with increasing temperature but, upon cooling, the reverse reaction takes place with an O2 uptake which occurs down to 600 8C, as confirmed by TG measurements. Under N2 flow, more complex and irreversible reactions take place. The first decomposition step of spinel phase is accomplished between 600 and 800 8C according to Eq. (4): oxygen loss accompanies the formation of o-LiMnO2 and Mn3O4 phases. The second step pertains to the transformation of o-LiMnO2 into LixMn12xO cubic solid solution, according to Eq. (5). At each temperature, an equilibrium is attained and the phases observed in the diffraction patterns depend on both temperature and time of the annealing. All these reactions are characteristic gas/solid processes: surfaces and grain boundaries are certainly involved along with residual segregated materials in their crystalline or amorphous state. Thus, preparation and morphology of the precursor material play a fundamental role in the outcome of the sintering procedure and the final properties (electrochemical or catalytic) of the lithium manganese spinel. This work provides a wealth of new information about interface reactions and cation distribution over the spinel sites as a function of oxygen partial pressure. A number of transformations occur between 600 and 800 8C, a temperature range where the material is usually synthesised and where it undergoes sintering processes. We argue that a better knowledge of the stability of spinel and its reactivity with oxygen is fundamental to achieve the performances needed for technological exploitation of the compound. V.

Rietveld re5nements of their neutron di4raction data revealed that Cr is substituted for Mn selectively and that Li occupies only the 8a site. Thus, the above solid solutions can be expressed as Li(Mn22yCry)O4. The fractional coordinates of oxygen were almost the same in all the samples while the lattice parameter a decreased linearly with increasing Cr content. The lengths of (Mn, Cr)+O bonds in (Mn, Cr)O6 octahedra changed in a manner expected from average ionic radii for Mn22yCry. Rietveld analyses of the X-ray di4raction data showed the crystallite size and anisotropic strain to decrease with increasing Cr content. ( 1999 Academic Press INTRODUCTION The spinel-type lithium manganese oxide LiMn2O4 and its related materials have been studied extensively as potential candidates for cathode materials in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (1). For the commercial use of the rechargeable battery, the total capacity after charge/discharge iterations over hundreds of times is important. An initial capacity of about 130 (mA h)/g, which is close to the theoretical value of 148 (mA h)/g, can be obtained with a Li/LiMn2O4 cell in a 4-V region, but its capacity fades rapidly during charge/discharge cycles. Li-rich and quaternary spinel oxides LiMn2~yMyO4 (M"Li or 3d transition metals) have been investigated to 1Present address: Advanced Science Research Center, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, Tokai, Naka-gun, Ibaraki 319-1195, Japan.

Until recently, Li-rich manganese oxide had been regarded as the most attractive candidate because a very small amount of excess Li, for example, y"0.04, makes cycle stability at room temperature much higher, whereas quaternary spinel phases required more substitution, e.g., 16 for M"Co or Cr (5). At present, fast capacity fading during charge/discharge cycling at relatively high temperature, e.g., 553C, has been recognized as a more serious problem (8}10). The capacity retention of cells using Li-rich spinel oxides is, however, poor at high temperature, and the application of quaternary spinel phases is now being reconsidered widely. Among them, the highest total performance is achieved in a Li/LiMn2~yCryO4 cell with y"0.012 (8). Reasons for its stability against the capacity fading, in particular at high temperature, have been estimated by several workers (5, 6, 8) but unsettled as yet. The crystal structures of LiMn2~yCryO4 were studied only by X-ray di!raction despite the importance of their structural information (5, 6, 11}13). Rietveld re"nement with X-ray di!raction data on the basis of cubic space group Fd31 m (no. 227) gives only a lattice parameter a and an oxygen coordinate with a large estimated standard deviation (e.s.d.). Main questions concerning their crystal structures are as follows: (i) Are Cr atoms substituted for Mn atoms at the octahedral 16d site selectively? (ii) Do Li atoms occupy only the tetrahedral 8a site? (iii) Do O atoms fully occupy the 32e site? (iv) How do metal}oxygen bond lengths vary with the content of Cr? 322 0022-4596/99 $30.00 Copyright ( 1999 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. Answers to these questions can hardly be derived from Rietveld re"nement of X-ray di!raction data. In this study, we have applied both neutron and X-ray powder di!raction to LiMn2~yCryO4 and obtained detailed information about their structural properties. EXPERIMENTAL Mn2O3 was produced by heating MnCO3 (99.9%, Soekawa Chemicals) at 5003C for 24 h. LiMn2~yCryO4 (y"0, 19, 16, and 13) were prepared by heating Li2CO3 (99%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), Cr2O3 (special quality, Yoneyama Chemical Industries), and Mn2O3 at 7003C for 3 days in air with intermittent grinding and cooling slowly at a rate of 13C/min (5, 14). Neutron powder di!raction data of the four samples were measured at 295 K for ca. 10 h on the time-of-#ight (TOF) neutron di!ractometer Vega (15) at the pulsed spallation neutron facility KENS. The samples were contained in a cylindrical V cell 8 mm in diameter, 30 mm in height, and 25 lm in thickness. An array of 112 position-sensitive detectors (PSDs) installed in a backward bank with a 2h range from 1453 to 1753 was used to collect the intensity data. Incident neutron spectra were monitored with a 3He monitor counter. The di!erence in e$ciency between the PSDs and the monitor counter was corrected using intensity data obtained in a separate measurement of incoherent scattering from V. X-ray powder di!raction data of the four samples were measured at 295 K on a Rigaku RAD-C system with CuKa radiation monochromatized with curved graphite. Divergence and antiscatter slits of 123 were selected to include the 111 re#ection at 2h"18.63 (lattice-plane spacing, d" 4.76 As ), and a receiving slit of 0.15 mm to attain good resolution. The step width was set at 0.033, which was close to 15 of the minimum full-width at half maximum (fwhm) for the 111 re#ection. The counting time per step was 10 s for all the samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Neutron powder di!raction data in a d range from 0.45 to 3.20 As were analyzed by a Rietveld-re"nement program RIETAN-98T for TOF neutron di!raction (16). An original technique called partial pro"le relaxation in RIETAN-98T was applied to 311, 400, 622, 731, and 553 re#ections in all the samples, which lowered R81 by 0.2}0.5%. Coherent scattering lengths used for the re"nements were !1.90 fm (Li), !3.73 fm (Mn), 3.635 fm (Cr), and 5.803 fm (O) (17). X-ray powder di!raction data in a 2h region from 123 to 1203 were analyzed by another Rietveld-re"nement program RIETAN-97b for angle-dispersive di!raction (18). To attain better "tting for low-angle re#ections, coe$cients in Simpson's numerical integral to express pro"le asymmetry (26) were slightly modi"ed. Preferred orientation was not corrected in any of the re"nements. All the e.s.d.'s of re"nable structure parameters were calculated according to Scott's procedure (19), which a!orded e.s.d.'s about three times as large as those evaluated with the conventional one. In preliminary Rietveld re"nements of the X-ray di!raction data, the occupancy, g, of Mn/Cr at the 8a and 16c sites proved to be negligible in all the samples. The X-ray di!raction patterns of samples with the nominal compositions LiMn2O4 and LiMn5@3Cr1@3O4 showed them to contain two phases. In LiMn2O4, the low-temperature phase (20) coexisted even at room temperature with a mass fraction of ca. 0.061(4). LiMn5@3Cr1@3O4 was most likely composed of isotypic Cr-rich and Cr-poor cubic spinel phases, which will hereafter be referred to as aand b-phases, respectively (see Fig. 1). Lattice parameters and mass fractions of 0.900(4) for the a-phase and 0.100 for the b-phase were determined by a multiphase Rietveld re"nement. With a lattice parameter vs the Cr content curve in a range 04y416, the Cr content for the b-phase, yb, was estimated to be 0.08 (see Fig. 2), and that for the a-phase, ya, to be ca. 0.36, which was calculated with the equation ya]0.900#0.08]0.100"13. Preliminary Rietveld re"nements of the neutron di!raction data gave negligibly small occupation factors for Li at the 16c site. They were therefore "xed at zero for all the samples in subsequent re"nements. The occupation factors of O at the 32e site, g(O), were also re"ned. The resulting occupancies were, for example, 0.982(17) for y"16 and 0.999(20) for y"19, which correspond to chemical formulas of LiMn11@6Cr1@6O3.93(7) and LiMn17@9Cr1@9 O4.00(8), respectively. Though the oxygen site in the former sample appeared to be slightly de"cient, g(O) is strongly correlated with other re"nable parameters, in particular, a scale factor and atomic displacement parameters. The oxygen stoichiometry is a!ected by the calcination temperature and the rate of cooling (21, 22). Taking into account the heating temperature (7003C) and the very small cooling rate of 13C/min on the synthesis of the present samples and the e.s.d.'s of g(O) very near to unity, we can safely conclude that the 32e site is fully occupied by O and "xed g(O) at unity for all the samples in subsequent re"nements. The strong correlation and large e.s.d.'s may be ascribable to the large multiplicity of the O site. The occupation factors of Mn at the 16d site, g(Mn), were re"ned under a linear constraint of g(Cr)"1!g(Mn), and the converged value was, for example, 0.921(8) in the case of y"16, in accordance with the nominal value, 11/(6]2)"0.9167, within the e.s.d. Then, g(Mn)'s were "xed at the nominal values in "nal re"nements. The mixed-metal 16d site will hereinafter be termed &&B''. Figure 3 shows Rietveld-re"nement patterns for the neutron di!raction data of LiMn11@6Cr1@6O4. Weak re#ections near 1.5, 1.6, 2.3, and 2.8 As were due to the Al wall of a sample chamber and excluded from the analyses. Table 1 INVESTIGATION OF LiMn2~yCryO4 323 FIG. 1.

Lattice parameter vs Cr content, y, in LiMn2~yCryO4. lists the "nal structure parameters obtained with the neutron di!raction data. The Li}O and B}O bond lengths, l, calculated with ORFFE (23) are given in Table 2 and plotted against y in Fig. 4. These bond lengths decreased linearly with increasing Cr content. Table 2 also lists l#!-(Li}O) and l#!-(B}O) calculated from the e!ective ionic radii of the Li`, Mn3`, Mn4`, and Cr3` ions (24). The oxidation states of Mn,#n, were calculated on the basis of electrical neutrality and the assumption that the valence of Cr is#3. Although l#!-(Li}O) did not change at all, l(Li}O) and l(Mn}O) varied in accordance with l#!-(B}O), which supports our structural model where the average oxidation state of Mn increases with increasing Cr content. The di!raction patterns of LiMn2~yCryO4 showed broadening of re#ection pro"les with its degree dependent on y. Then, we analyzed the pro"le broadening quantitatively with the X-ray powder di!raction data. The pro"le shape function adopted in RIETAN-97b is the pseudoVoigt function of Thompson, Cox, and Hastings (25) made asymmetric with Howard's procedure (26). The pseudoVoigt function is calculated from ;, <, =, and P for a Gaussian component and X, X%, >, and >% for a Lorentzian component (27, 28). X-ray di!raction data of NIST SRM 640b (Si) and SRM 674a (CeO2, Cr2O3, Al2O3, TiO2, and ZnO) were measured to evaluate pro"le parameters related to instrumental resolution: <, =, and >. By careful Rietveld re"nements of those standard samples, < and = were respectively found to be !1.7]10~3 and 1.34226]10~3 and "xed at these values in subsequent re"nements (27). > was estimated at 3.0]10~2, which will be referred to as >*/45 in what follows. In the Rietveld re"nements of LiMn2~yCryO4, only ;, X, and > were varied. Anisotropic-broadening parameters for microstrain, >%, were also re"ned on the assumption that the anisotropicbroadening axis is [100], whereas anisotropic Lorentzian 324 OIKAWA ET AL. FIG. 3. Rietveld re"nement patterns of LiMn11@6Cr1@6O4 for the TOF neutron di!raction data measured at room temperature. TOF regions excluded from the Rietveld re"nement are marked with asterisks. Scherrer broadening parameters, X%, were "xed at 0. Table 3 lists the "nal pro"le parameters and structure parameters obtained with the X-ray di!raction data. The crystallite size, p, and anisotropic strain, S, in percentage points were calculated from re"ned pro"le parameters, p (lm)"180K nX ] j 10000 , [1] SE*100+" n 180 (>#>%!>*/45)]100, [2] So*100+" n 180 (>!>*/45)]100, [3] where j is the X-ray wavelength ("1.540562 As ) and SE*100+ and So*100+ are the components of strain parallel and perpendicular to the [100] axis, respectively (27, 28). The Scherrer constant, K, was assumed to be unity. The resulting crystallite sizes and strains are plotted in Fig. 5. Anisotropy in the pro"le broadening and p obviously decreased with increasing Cr content of the present sample. The crystallite size, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the surface area, is regarded as one of the most critical parameters in preventing Mn dissolution (10), which mainly originates from the surface. The p values derived from the re"ned pro"le parameters suggest that substitution of Cr for Mn in a great degree is unfavorable for application to a cathode material because of the resultant decrease in crystallite size, i.e., the increase in surface area. To clear the relation between Cr content and crystallite size, more precise pro"le analysis as well as Rietveld re"nement of di!raction data taken on the samples prepared by di!erent conditions, e.g., di!erent compositinons and/or di!erent calcination temperatures, is indispensable. Anisotropic pro"le broadening mainly arises from elastic anisotropy and/or anisotropic internal stress. The elastic property will not vary very much by introducing a small amount of Cr. Then, the suppression of anisotropic broadening on Cr doping may be caused by the elastic anomaly near the phase-transition temperature (14), which drops drastically on Cr substitution. Anisotropic internal stress is also likely to remain near the phase transition, owing to the inhomogeneity of the transition temperature. In any of these cases, the stored elastic energy leads to the instability of the structure, degrading the cycle performance. A more detailed pro"le analysis of di!raction data taken near the phase-transition temperature is necessary to learn the origin of the anisotropic pro"le broadening.

FIG. 5. Crystallite size and strain vs Cr content, y, in LiMn2~yCryO4. charge region where most Li` ions were deintercalated from the cathode material. The introduction of Cr3` ions into the 16d positions stabilizes a network composed of [Mn2~yCry]O6 octahedra over many cycles in the 4-V region because parts of Li` ions remain in the cathode. Similarly, the Li/Li[Mn2~yLiy]O4 cell in which the reaction Li(Mn2~yLiy)O4 8 Lix(Mn2~yLiy)O4 (x53y) [5] proceeds instead of reaction [4] also exhibits good cycle performance for the same reason. In the fully charged state, the amount of remaining Li` ions in reaction [5] is three times as large as that in reaction [4] when y is the same. Therefore, substitution of Li with a y value greater than 0.05, which is required for capacity retention at high temperature, leads to a reduction in the initial capacity. Robertson et al. (8) studied the cycle performance of an Li/LiMn2~yCryO4 (04y40.14) cell in a 4-V region and concluded that the optimum composition was LiMn1.988Cr0.012O4. The cycle performance vs y relation reported by them, however, seems to be somewhat inconsistent with that expected from our results; for example, the discharge capacity of Li/LiMn1.98Cr0.02O4 is larger than that of Li/LiMn2O4 during all the cycles. The most probable reason for such a kind of inconsistency is inclusion of impurities. Close characterization of cathode materials is indispensable for understanding the cycle stability in such a region of low-level doping. In particular, structural properties such as those revealed in the present work are believed to a!ect the performance of Li-ion batteries. INVESTIGATION OF LiMn2~yCryO4 327 REFERENCES 1. R.

For y'0.62, the cyclability is worse than for LiMn2O4, and for y50.75 the capacity fading becomes very fast. The electron energy loss spectroscopy study confirms that the deintercalation in the range 3.5–4.3 V corresponds to a MnIII–MnIV oxidation. Further deintercalation between 4.3 and 5.1 V mainly corresponds to a CrIII–CrIV oxidation with, however, the formation of a significant amount of CrVI for the highest Cr content y 5 0.75. In the starting compounds LiM2O4, M 5 Cr, Mn, Rietveld refinements show that the 8a and 16d sites of the spinel structure are occupied by Li and M, respectively. The Li deintercalation up to 5.1 V induces structural defects which do not disappear completely upon the subsequent intercalation down to 3.5 V; their concentration increases upon cycling. Such defects consist of M cations occupying an 8a site (‘‘Td defect’’) or a 16c site (‘‘16c defect’’), instead of 16d. Both defects imply a lowering of the tetrahedral Li concentration which accounts for the experimental capacity loss upon cycling. ( 1997 Academic Press INTRODUCTION The electrochemical properties of members of the spinel solid solution LiCryMn2~yO4 (04y41), as positive electrode materials for Li batteries were previously described (1, 2). It was shown that upon substitution of MnIII by CrIII a capacity decrease occurs in the voltage range 3.5—4.3 V (all voltages reported in this article are given versus Li metal). More recently, an electrochemical study of the title compounds extended up to 5.4 V showed that the capacity lost upon this substitution could be recovered at higher voltage (3). However, the strong dependence of the electrochemical properties on the Cr content led us to undertake Rietveld refinements on materials corresponding to various y values, at different steps of the deintercalation—intercalation reaction, and after several charge/discharge cycles (the title compounds remain crystalline even after 300 cycles which enables such a structural study). This paper presents a Rietveld analysis of the structure modifications that are induced by the electrochemical treatment of the title compounds along with an investigation of the oxidation states of Cr and Mn cations by electron energy loss spectoscopy (EELS). EXPERIMENTAL The starting compounds LiCryMn2~yO4, 04y41, were prepared by solid state reaction at 750°C as previously indicated (3). Chemical analyses of Li and Mn were made by flame absorption spectrometry. They agree with the above mentioned formulas. The Cr : Mn ratios as well as the sample homogeneity were verified using a microprobe and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry in a Jeol JSM35 electron microscope. The crystals are cuboctahedra, approximately 1 lm in dimension (in agreement with the measured surface areas, all close to 2 m2 g~1). LixCryMn2~yO4 compounds with x(1 were electrochemically prepared (potentiostatic mode) at the end of the major electrochemical reactions, from the starting materials, by charge/discharge of Li batteries (for details, see (3); one charge or discharge within 50 h). The final voltage (3.5, 4.3, or 5.1 V) was maintained until a constant, negligible current was reached. Samples of 10 mg, approximately, were obtained (under inert gas) from each composite positive electrode. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using CuKa radiation, in the 2h range 5—120°, with steps of 0.03°(2h) and a step time of 12 s. As some electrochemically prepared materials were rapidly altered when exposed to air, all LixCryMn2~yO4 (x(1) samples were protected with a 372 0022-4596/97 $25.00 Copyright ( 1997 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

Relative capacity (in percent of the initial capacity) variation upon cycling of LixCryMn2~yO4 materials (charges at C/6, discharges at C/15). Kapton film. For each LiCryMn2~yO4 starting compound, two data sets, with and without the protective film, were recorded and used in refinements for comparison. Most of the diffraction lines exhibit large intensities; therefore, problems arising in some difference profiles were easily detected. However, as large intensities also lead to underestimated values of the standard deviations p (4), some refinements from XRPD data obtained with a step time of 2 s were also performed; they indicate that the p values reported in Table 2 should be multiplied by 1.5, approximately. Accordingly, the errors mentioned in Figs. 6 to 10 correspond to 1.5p. For LixCryMn2~yO4 (x(1) samples, most of the XRPD data were recorded within 2 days after the end of the electrochemical preparation. However, some samples were allowed to relax for 3 months, under inert gas, before the data collection. The structure refinements were carried out using program GSAS (5). Nearly 20 background points were fixed, and 4 coefficients of a cosine Fourier series were refined, together with the zero point, the cell parameter, and 6 line-profile parameters (second profile function of GSAS). As the protective film strongly lowered the intensity of the first line at low 2h angle, the 2h range used in the refinements was limited to 34—120°. In this range, the lowering was weak and looked like an absorption effect leading to slightly negative thermal parameters o. An absorption coefficient was adjusted in order to obtain plausible o values together with a satisfactory fit. Comparative refinements of the starting compounds have shown that the collection and refinement conditions did not influence the structural results significantly. The electron energy loss spectroscopy study was performed using a Philips CM30 microscope equipped with a Gatan 666 parallel spectrometer. For an easier analysis, the LixCryMn2~yO4 (x(1) samples were prepared without organic binder; the sample preparation (grid) and the transfer into the microscope were performed under inert gas. In order to avoid the influence of the electron beam on the spectra, the samples were cooled down to 120 K, and the irradiation time was reduced to 0.1 s. For each sample, spectra were accumulated until any spectrum shift was observed. The lines at the L3 and L2 edges of Cr and Mn were compared with those in MnO, Mn2O3, MnO2, Cr2O3, CrO2, and CrO3. The oxidation states of Cr and Mn were inferred from both the L3 line positions and the L2/L3 line intensity ratios, according to a method described in (6). The error in oxidation states is approximately 0.1. RESULTS Summary of the Electrochemical Studies Typical discharge curves obtained after a charge up to 5.4 V are presented in Fig. 1. They show that the reversible Li intercalation occurs in two steps at about 4.9 and 4 V. In agreement with the previous studies (1, 2), the capacity of the 4-V process decreases with increasing chromium content. On the other hand, the capacity of the 4.9 V process increases with y. The chromium substitution is beneficial to the overall capacity for y40.62 and to the specific energy as well, due to a higher average intercalation voltage than in the case of LiMn2O4 (3). For y'0.62 the capacity decreases with y and the average voltage remains constant. Furthermore, a lower capacity loss upon cycling is observed for y40.5 compared to the nonsubstituted LiMn2O4 material, whereas the capacity fading is very fast for y50.75 (Fig. 2). As a summary, a break is observed in the variation of many electrochemical parameters with y, such as capacity, average voltage, and cyclability. At this point, one wonders why so JSSC 7476 SPINEL OXIDES LiCryMn2~yO4 373 TABLE 1 Oxidation States of Cr and Mn Inferred from the EELS Spectra (Expected Values in Parentheses, See Text) Sample EM/ (eV) Mn EC3 (eV) Cr SC(0) 640.0 3.5 (3.50) — — SC(25) 640.3 3.7 (3.57) 575.5 3.0 (3.00) SC(50) 640.5 3.7 (3.67) 575.4 3.0 (3.00) SC(75) 640.6 3.9 (3.80) 575.5 3.0 (3.00) SC(100) 640.9 4.1 (4.00) 575.6 3.1 (3.00) C4.3(25) 640.8 4.1 (4.00) 575.3 2.9 (3.00) C5.1(25) 641.0 4.2 (4.00) 576.4 4.0 (4.00) D4.3(25) 640.6 3.9 (4.00) 575.5 3.0 (3.00) C4.3(75) 640.8 4.1 (4.00) 575.4 3.0 (3.00) C5.1(75) 640.8 4.1 (4.00) 576.3 3.9 (4.00) D4.3(75) 640.7 3.9 (4.00) 575.5 3.0 (3.00) Note.

The inset shows the Cr—L2,3 lines on an expanded scale for C4.3 and C5.1 compounds. different behaviors can arise. The studies which follow were undertaken with the aim to answer this question. EELS Study The oxidation states of Cr and Mn were determined in the starting compounds (hereafter named SC(y*102)) and in the LixCryMn2~yO4 (x(1) compounds with y"0.25 and 0.75 at the following voltages: 4.3 V (first charge, samples hereafter named C4.3(25) and C4.3(75), respectively), 5.1 V (first charge, samples C5.1(25) and C5.1(75)), and 4.3 V (subsequent first discharge, samples D4.3(25) and D4.3(75)). Table 1 shows that, in the SCs, the values obtained for Cr and Mn are in good agreement with the expected formula Li(CrIIIy MnIII1~y)MnIVO4. It also indicates that a reversible MnIII to MnIV oxidation occurs in the range 3.5—4.3 V, whereas a reversible CrIII to CrIV oxidation is observed in the higher voltage range 4.3—5.1 V. However, the shape of some Cr—L2,3 and Mn—L2,3 lines strongly suggest a less simple situation. For chromium, the two fully oxidized samples C5.1(25) and C5.1(75) lead to slightly different L2,3 line profiles as compared to C4.3(25) and C4.3(75), with a larger linewidth likely due to a small amount of CrVI. Furthermore, for all the electrochemically prepared samples, the Mn—L3 line exhibits a shoulder indicating a small amount of MnIII. In the case of C4.3(25) and C4.3(75) this shoulder is very weak in fair agreement with the very low MnIII content remaining (inferred from the Li content determined by electrochemical titration). In LixCry Mn2~yO4 (x(1), a complete oxidation of MnIII would imply a lithium content x"y at 4.3 V, whereas the experimental x values are all slightly larger (3). For C5.1(25), C5.1(75), D4.3(25), and D4.3(75) the shoulders are surprisingly more pronounced and especially in the case of y"0.75 (Fig. 3). EELS results can then be summarized as follows: (i) at 3.5 V, the initial species are CrIII, MnIII, and MnIV, (ii) at the end of the first oxidation step (4.3 V), mainly CrIII and MnIV are observed, which means that MnIII is oxidized first, (iii) during the second oxidation step up to 5.1 V, CrIII is oxidized to CrIV mainly; however as the Li content x is not zero some 3# cations must remain, but, surprisingly these are MnIII mainly. For C5.1(75) the MnIII content is even larger than for C4.3(75). Moreover, there is evidence for Cr in an oxidation state higher than 4, and likely CrVI. (iv) Cationic species in D4.3 samples are similar to those observed in C4.3 materials; however there is an indication that some CrVI formed during the charge up to 5.1 V could remain, and especially for D4.3(75). JSSC 7476 374 SIGALA ET AL. FIG. 4. Profile of the (440) line in the XRPD pattern of the compound with y"0.75 at various steps of the electrochemical treatment. Rietveld Refinements Rietveld refinements were undertaken on SC, C4.3, C5.1, and D4.3 compounds with various Cr contents as well as on materials after n complete charge—discharge cycles between 3.5 and 5.1 V (hereafter named nCY(y*102)). XRPD patterns of electrochemically prepared samples are similar to those of LiMn2O4. This observation indicates, roughly speaking, a low electron density in the 8a tetrahedral site of the spinel structure, and transition metal M (M"Cr, Mn) mainly located in the 16d octahedral site. Even after at least 15 cycles, the linewidths remain small, i.e., almost identical to those in the starting compounds (see Fig. 4). (A few tests have shown a slight linewidth increase after 300 cycles). On the other hand, much larger linewidths are observed upon deintercalation (C4.3 and C5.1 compounds). This increase of linewidths and its 2h dependence strongly suggest a lack of homogeneity, confirmed, as illustrated by Fig. 4, by a significant decrease after relaxation for a long time. It can be noticed that SEM studies performed on samples subjected to several tens of cycles did not reveal any change of the crystals, either in size or in shape. Preliminary Rietveld refinements were performed considering occupations of 8a, 16d, and 32e sites of space group Fd31 m, and refining the following atomic parameters: (i) the positional parameter xO for the oxygen atom in 32e, (ii) an overall thermal parameter o according to the linear constraint: oL*"oC3"oM/"oO!0.002 As 2. This constraint was retained after many tests to ensure reasonable refinements of site occupancies, (iii) an occupancy parameter t according to the structural formula: (Lix~tCrt)T$ [Cry~tLitMn2~y]O)O4, [1] JSSC 7476 SPINEL OXIDES LiCryMn2~yO4 375 where Td and Oh stand for 8a and 16d sites, respectively. It must be mentioned that as Cr and Mn scattering factors are very close to each other it is not possible to distinguish between these two elements in the refinements and formula [1] could be written with some Mn in Td site as well. In the LixCryMn2~yO4 (x(1) compounds, the Li content x was inferred from the electrochemical curves and therefore the error on x is difficult to estimate; it could be as large as 0.1 and even more after many cycles. When x(1, the presence of transition metal cations in Td site (hereafter called ‘‘Td defect’’) is not necessarily compensated by the equivalent amount of Li in 16d site. However, the Li scattering factor is small compared to those of Mn and Cr and the results of refinements accounting for this possibility (Formula [2]) were not significantly different from those made with the use of Formula [1]. Consequently, meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn from the refinement of Li occupancies. (LixMth1~x~t)8a[htM2~t]16dO4, (M"Cry@2Mn1~y@2). [2] The refinement conditions indicated above gave satisfactory results in most cases. For a few samples, however, they led to some remaining problems of line intensity. The possibility of M vacancies in 16d sites and/or of M occupying other sites was therefore introduced. Among the other ‘‘possible’’ sites for M, i.e., 8b and 48f (tetrahedral), and 16c (octahedral), the 16c site was found to be occupied (‘‘16c defects’’), which implies an equivalent amount of cation vacancies in the 16d site. However, in a first approach the two quantities —occupancy of the 16c site and amount of vacancies—were refined independently and, as expected, found to be close to each other. Finally, all refinements were made with the use of (Lix~eMtK1`e~x~t)8a[LieM2~t~zKt`z~e]16d(Mz)16cO4, [3] with 04x41; 04e4x; 04t41!(x!e); 04z4 2!t and where M is Cr and/or Mn (for each composition the overall M content is Cry@2Mn1~y@2). Note that M was arbitrarily introduced as Mn in 16c, Cr in 8a, and that e was taken as equal to 0. With these refinement conditions, satisfactory results were obtained in all cases. After the final refinements, all the difference profiles are satisfactory. For the C4.3 and C5.1 compounds however, noticeable remaining peaks due to markedly asymmetric line profiles are observed. Figure 5 shows representative examples of the Rietveld results. All the values of R81 are close to (or even below) RE91, the highest value corresponding to s2"(R81/RE91)2"3.4, for SC(25). The reliability factors RF and RF2 range from 3.7 to 8.2% (for 1CY(25)), with a mean value of 5.4%, and from 3.4 to 10.4% (for 15CY(0)), with a mean value of 5.2%, respectively, for 30 to 33 independent reflections. Table 2 presents the main structural results (the lattice parameter a, the oxygen coordinate xO, t, and z) and includes the lithium contents x inferred from the electrochemical experiments. The distances from an 8a site and a 16d site, to the surrounding oxygen atoms (DT$ and DO), respectively), calculated from a and xO, were added in Table 2 since they will appear as meaningful parameters in the following discussion. For DO), the ‘‘theoretical’’ value given in parentheses is the distance calculated from the mean ionic radii (7) for the following ions in 16d: (i) CrIIIy MnIII1~yMnIV in the starting compounds or after n cycles, (ii) CrIIIy MnIIIx~yMnIV2~y with x close to y in C4.3 and D4.3 compounds, (iii) CrIIIx CrIVy~xMnIV2~y in C5.1 compounds. In addition to Table 2 the evolution of the above parameters with both the Cr content and the electrochemical treatment is illustrated through Figs. 6 to 10. Considering first the concentration z of ‘‘16c defects’’ it appears (Table 2) that all values are close to zero except for the largest Cr content y"0.75. In that case, Fig. 6 shows that the occupancy of the 16c sites becomes significant at the end of the first charge up to 5.1 V. Upon the following discharge down to 4.3 V, a hysteresis phenomenon is observed together with a weak relaxation. At the completion of the first cycle (n"1), the z value is close to zero. For n"15, however, z is no longer negligible and strongly suggests a progressive accumulation of 16c defects upon cycling. The ‘‘Td defects’’ concentrations t are virtually zero in the starting compounds but they become significant after any electrochemical treatment and all the more as the Cr content y increases (Fig. 7). Furthermore, it appears that: (i) Td defects still exist after a discharge down to 4.3 V, and at the completion of the first cycle (ii) a long relaxation time slightly lowers t, and (iii) a progressive accumulation of Td defects (similar to that of 16c defects) occurs upon cycling. Similarly, the DT$ and DO) distances strongly depend both on the electrochemical treatment and the chromium content, as illustrated by Figs. 8 and 9 for y"0.25 and 0.75. Once again changes are more pronounced for the highest chromium concentration. A lowering of DT$ occurs upon deintercalation of Li for all compounds (Table 2). For y"0.75 the size of the Td site is significantly reduced after 15 cycles. In Fig. 9, the DO) distances, for y"0.25 and 0.75, can be compared to the theoretical values calculated as mentioned above. For y"0.25, experimental and theoretical values are almost identical, except at 5.1 V where the JSSC 7476 376 SIGALA ET AL. FIG. 5.

Differences are much more pronounced for y"0.75; for instance, the deintercalation process up to 5.1 V does not induce any decrease of DO). In the starting compounds, the cell parameter a linearly decreases (from 8.2399(1) to 8.1960(1) As ) when y increases from 0 to 0.75, whereas the C5.1 products show the opposite dependence of a on y (Fig. 10). This means that the amplitude of a variations between SC and C5.1 compounds decreases when the Cr content increases. The evolution of a in the course of the first cycle and the a values after 15 cycles, for y"0.25 and 0.75, are displayed in Fig. 10 which shows that: (i) the difference between a values of C4.3 and D4.3 compounds is larger for y"0.75 than for y"0.25, (ii) the differences between a values of SC, 1CY, and 15CY compounds are negligible for y"0.25 but rather important for y"0.75. These observations suggest that the structural modifications, which occur upon cycling, increase with the Cr content. JSSC 7476 378 SIGALA ET AL. FIG. 6.

The mean error at 2p is less than 0.005 As . DISCUSSION Upon deintercalation up to 5.1 V, the formation of a Td defect, corresponding to a displacement of M cations from a 16d to an 8a site, induces a significant decrease of DT$, while DO) do not show the expected decrease, especially for y"0.75. These features strongly suggest a local oxidation of M in tetrahedral site, up to a high oxidation state (such as CrVI, MnVI, or MnVII) leading to a short M—O bond length. This local oxidation would be favored by the 16d to 8a displacement and stable in this case only. When a Td defect forms, either a vacancy appears in 16d or a tetrahedral Li moves to this site; in both cases, it induces an increase of DO). In agreement with the EELS results obtained for the compounds with a high Cr content, it is very likely that some CrVI cations occupy Td sites at high voltage and, the higher y, the higher the number of CrVIO4 groups formed and accumulated upon cycling.

The maximum error at 2p is 1.5]10~3 As . FIG. 11. Evolution of the experimental capacity loss (filled circles) and of the loss (t#2z) expected from structural study (squares), after 15 cycles, as a function of the Cr content. The experimental loss is the difference between the number of Li intercalated during the 1st and 16th discharges. Upon intercalation, most of the Td defects disappear due to reduction. Nevertheless, an accumulation of Td defects is detected in all nCY compounds, which raises the question, remaining unanswered, of the presence of tetrahedral Cr (or Mn) cations (likely with a high oxidation state) after the discharge. At 5.1 V, as most of the Td sites are empty, the formation of 16c defects corresponds to local modifications toward a rock salt structure. Note that the 16c site is larger than the 16d (2.12 As instead of 1.95 As , approximately), so that it should better accomodate a MIII cation than a MIV. Nevertheless, the formation of a 16c defect upon oxidation and that could contain a MIII cation is puzzling. However, considering for instance the C5.1(75) compound with t"0.10, the tetrahedral M cations (Td defects) are supposed to be highly charged and, according to the EELS results, likely to be CrVI. If so, each Td defect implies two additional charges with respect to a ‘‘normal’’ octahedral CrIV, and these charges must be balanced by two octahedral MIII cations. Taking into account the composition Li0.20CrVI0.10Cr0.65 Mn1.25O4 in C5.1(75), and the main conclusions of the EELS study, one can estimate the MnIII : MnIV ratio as 3 : 7. These values agree with the profile of the EELS spectrum and with the features already discussed for DO). An explanation of this puzzling situation could be provided by a local crystal field stabilization of MnIII, which is quite possible in such a disordered structure. Part of the MnIII cations could be stabilized in 16c sites, which are larger than 16d. What is the influence of Td and 16c defects on the number of Li that can be reversibly intercalated in the structure and especially of 8a Li ions, since their number probably determines the maximum capacity of the batteries in the range 3.5—5.1 V? It is obvious that a Td defect eliminates a tetrahedral Li site. An octahedral 16c site shares two faces with tetrahedral 8a sites and the 16c—8a distance is short: &1.8 As . Therefore, the formation of 16c defects implies (at least) twice as many Td vacancies, i.e., twice as many tetrahedral sites no longer accessible to Li ions. If one now considers the 15CY(75) compound, which exhibits many defects (t"0.09; z"0.11), the formula (Li0.69~bCr0.09K0.22`b)8a[LiaCr0.66K0.2~aMn1.14]16d (Mn0.11)16cO4, 04b40.69 04a40.2, [4] illustrates the limits implied by the defects (M is introduced arbitrarily as Cr in 8a and Mn in 16c). As already mentioned, the structural study could not provide precise informations on a and b. Nonzero a corresponds to additional defects. The b value is expected to be zero (it is close to zero, considering the experimental capacity of the corresponding battery). Nevertheless a nonzero b could arise from numerous possible limitations of the reversibility. Anyway, the maximum number of tetrahedral Li is 1!(t#2z), that is 0.69 in Formula [4]. Consequently, after n complete cycles, the capacity should drop at least down to 100[1! (t#2z)] percent of the initial capacity. The experimental capacity loss after 15 cycles (3) (loss expressed as a number of Li per LixM2O4 formula) can be compared, in Fig. 11, to (t#2z) for some 15CY compounds. The observation of the good correlation indicates that the structural defects are likely the main cause of the progressive capacity fading, at least for y"0.75. JSSC 7476 380 SIGALA ET AL. The detrimental effect of Cr on the capacity retention, at high Cr content, has supplementary explanations. On the one hand, a 16c defect should lower the mobility of Li, since the 16c site is situated on the diffusion path of Li. On the other hand, the higher the defect concentration, the smaller the Td sites, which therefore become still more convenient for highly charged cations. At high Cr content, the formation of tetrahedral CrVI, which is likely, well explains the rapid capacity loss by a high defect rate favoring accumulation of supplementary defects. Conversely, at low Cr content, i.e., y+0.25, the capacity retention is improved with respect to LiMn2O4. As the defect rates remain low and similar for y40.5, the defects could play an indirect role in this improvement. Indeed, the beneficial role of Cr could be due to the dependence of the cell parameter a on y: the smaller the lowering of a during the charge, the better the Li diffusion and the reversibility of defects formation via displacements of M; a lowering of elastic strains in the crystals can also play a beneficial role. CONCLUSION The electrochemical Li deintercalation from the compounds LiCrIIIy MnIII1~yMnIVO4, 04y41, induces a migration of some transition metal cations from 16d to 8a sites of the spinel structure. This formation of so called Td defects upon oxidation is not completely reversible; therefore an accumulation of Td defects is observed upon cycling that becomes all the more important as the Cr content increases. Simultaneously, but only at high Cr content (y'0.50), some transition metal cations move to 16c sites and an accumulation of such 16c defects is also observed. On account of EELS results and in agreement with structural features, Td defects would correspond to CrVI cations mainly, whereas 16c defects could result from a local crystal field stabilization of MnIII cations. Both types of defects render some Td sites no longer accessible to Li ions and this feature well explains the capacity loss observed upon cycling. REFERENCES 1. J.-M. Tarascon, E. Wang, F. K.

LITHIUM INSERTION INTO ~-MnO 2 AND THE RUTILE-SPINEL TRANSFORMATION W.I.F.David*, M.M.Thackeray +, P.G.Bruce, and J.B.Goodenough Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, South Parks Road, University of Oxford, Oxford OXI 3QR England (Received September 29, 1983; Refereed) ABSTRACT Room-temperature lithium insertion with n-butyl lithium into the rutile phase ~-MnO 2 results in a product Lil_6Mn02 that is shown to be isostructural with the tetragonal Li2[Mn2]O ~ phase obtained by room-temperature llthiation of the spinel Li[Mn2]Oq; it is distinguishable from the orthorhombic LiMnO 2 phase obtained with high-temperature synthesis, contrary to a previous report on llthiated ~-MnO 2. A model of the transformation mechanism, on lithiation, from the ~-MnO 2 framework to the [Mn2]O 4 framework of a spinel phase is suggested. Introduction Topochemlcal reactions with lithium have both a technical and a scientific importance. Technically, reversible lithium insertion into oxides and sulfides is of interest for electrodes in both electrochromlc displays [i] and secondary batteries [2]. Scientifically, room-temperature lithium insertion and/or extractlon, elther chemically or electrochemically, provides a synthetic route to unusual products [3,4] and unusual atomic order [5]. Two-dimensional (2D) insertion of lithium into the layered oxides V20516 ] and Mo0317 ] has been demonstrated; 2D extraction of lithium from the layered oxides LIMO2, M = Cr, Co or Ni, gives rise to Present Address: SERC Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory, Chilton, Didcot OXII OQX, UK. + Present Address: National Physical Research Laboratory CSIR, PO Box 395, Pretoria 0001, South Africa. 99 100 W.I.F. DAVID, et al. Vol. 19, No. i atmospheric-pressure preparation of oxides with cations of high valence state [4]. Murphy et al [8] have studied ID llthiatlon of several futile phases M02, including ~-Mn02, and we [5,9] have reported the room-temperature 3D llthiation of several spinels: cubic Fe304 and LI[Mn2]O 4 to obtain LixFe304 with 04x(2 and Lil+x[Mn2]04 with 0<~i, tetragonal Mn304 to obtain tetragonal LixMn304 with O<X<l. Transformation of the anatase phase of TiO 2 to the spinel Li[Ti2]O 4 on lithiation has also been reported [i0]. In this paper, we re-examlne the product of room-temperture, chemical llthiation of the rutile phase ~-MnO 2 because of the importance of activated y-MnO 2 as a cathode material in several lithium-based primary cells. The activated y-MnO 2 phase consists of a ramsdellite matrix with intergrowth domains of ~-MnO2[ll ]. Little information is available on the structural changes that occur upon lithium insertion into the electroactlve material. However, a recent study of the llthiatlon of ~-Mn0218 ] has indicated that up to 0.3 lithium atoms per formula unit may be topochemically inserted into the structure without transforming the rutile framework; on further lithiatlon the product is reported to become the orthorhombic LiMnO 2 phase obtained directly from high-temperature synthesis. The orthorhombic LiMnO 2 phase has Li + and Mn 3+ ions ordered into layers of octahedral sites, thus providing only a 2D interstitial space for Li+-ion motion [12]. Although we were able to confirm a disruption of the rutile framework at higher lithium concentrations, our lithiated product had an [Mn2]O 4 framework of an A[B2]O 4 tetragonal spinel with Li + ions occupying both octahedral and tetrahedral sites of a 3D interstitial space. A cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of the [Mn2]O 4 framework to tetragonal (c/a>l) symmetry is induced by the octahedral-site Mn 3+ ions. Experimental Lithiation of ~-MnO 2 (Koch-Light 99.95%) was carried out chemically on a fine powder immersed in a 1.6 molar solution of n-butyl lithium in hexane that was further diluted with sodlum-dried hexane. The reagents were stirred for approximately 170 hours at 50-600C under a dry dinitrogen atmosphere. The product was repeatedly washed in hexane and finally dried for several hours under vacuum. Chemical analysis of the lithiated product was carried out by atomic-absorption spectroscopy, which indicated a final composition of Lil±0.1Mn02. Structural characterization was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction on a Philips PWI050 dlffractometer with CuKa radiation and a quartz analyzing monochromater. Vol. 19, No. 1 Lil_~MnO 2 101 Results and Discussion The rutile structure of B-MnO 2 possesses the tetragonal space group P42/mnm with octahedral site Mn ~+ ions at positions 2a and 02. ions at positions 4f. The 4f coordinates x,x,O; ~,~,0; ~+x,~-x,1⁄2; ~-x,1⁄2+x,1⁄2 contain the variable positional parameter x, which permits distortion of the occupied octahedral sites to orthorhomblc point symmetry. , ,l ~x,~,~, i, il ~Y~ !

The positional parameter x allows the bridging anions of a chain to approach each other so as to screen better the intrachain electrostatic repulsion between cations. The bridging Mn-O distances within a chain are shorter than the apical Mn-O distances within the basal planes. Of particular interest is the primltlve-tetragonal packing of the rutile anion array [13-15] which is derived from hexagonal close packing by cooperative rotations of the strings of corner-shared octahedra. The curved arrows of Fig. 2(a) indicate the sense of rotation of these strings that is required to restore the hexagonal close packing of the anion array illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Primitive tetragonal packing opens up the interstitial ID channels of face-shared oetahedra and tetrahedra to give them a square cross-sectlon in the basal plane, see Fig. 2(a), and thus to optimize the possibility of ID H+-ion or Li+-ion mobility within a channel parallel to the c-axls. 102 W.I.F, DAVID, et al.

Note in particular the strong (iii) peak, which is indicative of the [Mn2]O ~ framework of the Li[Mn2]O ~ spinel. The significant line broadening is due to the small particle size of the lithiated powder.

The 16c sites form an array similar to the 16d-slte array, but displaced half a lattice parameter along any cube axis. The remaining empty sites are the 8b tetrahedral sites sharing faces with the filled 16d sites and the 48f tetrahedral sites sharing two 16d-slte and two 16c-slte faces. The electrostatic forces between lithium and manganese ions in the llthiated product Lil+x[Mn2]O4 favor Li+-ion occupancy of 16c and 8a sites. Room-temperature llthlatlon of the spinel Li[Mn2]O4has been shown [9] to produce a phase Li2[Mn2]O ~ having the [Mn2]O 4 framework of the original spinel, but distorted from cubic to tetragonal (c/a=l.16) symmetry by a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion associated with the Mn 3+ ions. For convenience and clarity, we refer the atomic positions in the tetragonal phase to the cubic space group Fd3m: one Li + ion per formula unit appears to occupy the tetrahedral 8a sites, as in the original spinel, and the inserted Li + ions are randomly distributed on half the 16c sites, which share faces with Li + ions on 8a sites. Although the Li+-Li + electrostatic repulsions were expected to stabilize all the Li + ions on 16c positions, refinement of the pow@er data favored a Li+-ion distribution over both 8a and 16c positions [9]. The interstitial space of face-shared 8a and 16c sites is thus only two-thlrds filled, and all the 16d manganese are reduced to Mn 3+ ions. 104 W.I.F. DAVID, et al. Vol. 19, No. I The structure of Lil_~MnO 2 obtained from lithiated ~-MnO 2 was refined, with an available program [16] from the integrated Bragg intensities of the diffraction profile of Fig. 3(b); 19 intensities from 46 reflections were used. Of the several structural models considered within the tetragonal-spinel space groups 141/amd of Li2[Mn2]04, axial ratio c/a = 1.145, the best fit was obtained with the LI + ions distributed half on 8a sites and half randomly distributed on 16c sites as in the Li2[Mn2]O 4 phase obtained by llthlating Li[Mn2]O 4. Refined structural parameters for this model are given in Table I; the reliability factor R = 100~Ilobs-lcalcl/~lobs = 16.0 percent was obtained with isotropic temperature factors for the 02and Mn 3+ ions. Although It is impossible to determine Li+-ion occupancies accurately because of the weak scattering power of this ion, it is clear from Table I that significant Li+-ion concentrations are to be found on both the 8a and 16c positions of the cublc-spinel space group. Furthermore, the magnitude of the c/a ratio is consistent with a nearly complete reduction of all the 16d octahedral-site manganese to the Mn 3+ state. Therefore we may conclude that the phase we obtained from low-temperature chemical lithlation of the rutile phase ~-MnO 2 is the tetragonal splnel-related phase (Lil-6)16cLiSa[Mn2J+]16d04. The orthorhombic LIMnO 2 phase obtained by high-temperature synthesis has a different ordering of Mn s+ ions on the octahedral sites of the distorted cublc-close-packed anion array. Alternate layers of manganese and lithium produce a unique axis that is not coincident with the unique axis generated by a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of the Mn 3+ ions, so the net symmetry is orthorhomblc [12].

The Rutile-Spinel Transformation As shown in Fig. 2, the rutile-spinel transformation is essentially diffusionless and only a little more complicated than the change from primitive-tetragonal to hexagonal close packing of the anions. The latter change only requires the rotation of edge-shared strings of octahedra, shown in Fig. 2(a) by the curved arrows, to generate the hexagonal configuration of Fig. 2(b). The rutile-spinel transformation on the other hand, requires a cooperative Jump to a nearest-neighbor site of half the cation array followed by an adjustment of the Mn-O distances to convert the tetragonal anion packing of rutile to the cubic close packing of anions in spinel. Vol. 19, No. 1 Lil_6MnO 2 105 Cations in half the c-axls chains remain fixed. Alternate cations in the remaining, body-centered, c-axis chains are displaced to distorted octahedral sites at the mid-polnts of the 100 unit-cell faces Fig.l(b). The remaining cations in the chains are similarly displaced to octahedral sites at the mld-points of the OlO unit-cell faces. This results in a redistribution of the cations between the tetagonally packed oxide layers as shown by the arrows in Fig. 2(c). A diffuslonless readjustment of the anion array to give regular octahedra about the manganese but without shared faces, gives the [Mn2]04 spinel framework shown in Fig. 2(d). These adjustments can be made by a shear motion, represented by the arrows at the side of Fig. 2(c), that flops the distorted octahedra of the square channels in a direction opposite to the curved arrows of Fig. 2(a). The driving force for the rutile-spinel transformation is the electrostatic repulsion between Li + and Mn 4+/3+ ions. The initial lithium atoms enter the square channels of the rutile phase as Li + ions; they donate one electron each to the manganese array to reduce Mn ~q" to Mn S+. Within a square channel, a Li + ion shares site faces with two neighboring manganese ions; and transformation to hexagonal close packing of the anions would only increase this electrostatic repulsion. Therefore we must expect a transformation to a cubic close packing of the anions in which octahedral sites share only edges. The spinel framework is seen to be directly accessible from the rutile structure via an essentially diffusionless transition. Room-temperature rearrangement of the Li + ions to optimal interstitial positions confronts no significant diffusional barrier. We presume that the energy difference between the manganese ordering in the orthorhombic LiMnO 2 phase and in the [Mn2]O 4 spinel framework is small and the spinel framework may be the more stable if the phase is Li+-ion deficient. Finally, a similar transformation to that described herein may occur on deep discharge in the commercial y-MnO 2 cathode material, which contains some ~-MnO 2 • We gratefully acknowledge support from the US AFOSR under Contract No83-0052, the Admiralty Marine Technology Establishment (M.0.D.), South African Inventions Development Corporation with the C.S.I.R., South Africa and the Commission of the European Communities within the framework of the Energy Conservation R & D Program.

The structural refinements unambiguously show that both 925°°C quenching and low-temperature ammonia treatment induce oxygen vacancies in the spinel lattice. However, the mechanism of oxygen loss is markedly different between quenchings at 800 and 925°°C. While the latter actually corresponds to the introduction of anionic vacancies at constant cation composition, the former is due to a rearrangement of the Li/Mn ratio in the spinel phase and the formation of an additional lithium-rich phase Li2MnO3. The presence of vacancies induce a significant increase in atomic displacement parameters of oxygen. ( 1998 Academic Press INTRODUCTION The Li—Mn—O spinel system has been widely studied in the search for good cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries (1, 2). Cation-defective spinel phases have been known in this system for many years, following the discovery of j-MnO2 (3) and Li2Mn4O9, the latter corresponding to Li1~dhd[Mn2~2dh2d]O4 in spinel notation (4). The electrochemical capacity on lithium intercalation depends on the stoichiometry of the host spinel phase, which can be varied in several ways: (i) by varying a along the solid solution Li1`aMn2~aO4, within the limits 04a41/3 (corresponding to the manganese valence range #3.54l(Mn) 4#4), (ii) by introducing cationic vacancies. Cation-vacant compositions are attractive for lithium intercalation on the so-called 3 V electrochemical reaction, which corresponds to the filling of octahedral sites in the spinel structure, with increased capacity in the case of a cation-deficient host material (1, 5). Another kind of defect composition in this system has been suggested recently, following the observation of reversible oxygen loss in Li1.05Mn2O4 by Tarascon et al. (6). This effect, which was confirmed and studied in more detail by Sugiyama (7) and Thackeray (8), is accompanied by a reversible phase transition between cubic and tetragonal forms and was ascribed to the occurence of oxygen atom vacancies in the structure. This hypothesis was further substantiated by Richard et al. (9), who reported a similar effect induced by low-temperature annealing of Li1.33Mn1.67O4 in gaseous ammonia. The only available structural investigations on the oxygen-vacant phases are powder X-ray diffraction studies. These do not allow accurate determination of the site occupancies of light atoms such as lithium (or even oxygen) in the presence of manganese. In addition, anion vacancies in the spinel structure, which is based on a cubic compact anionic network, have never been reported previously to our knowledge. For these reasons, powder neutron diffraction experiments were undertaken on several Li—Mn—O samples in which cationic or anionic vacancies are expected to occur. This paper presents the results of this neutron diffraction study on two such systems: Li1.05Mn2O4~d quenched from high temperature and Li1`aMn2~aO4~d with a close to 0.33 treated by ammonia gas. EXPERIMENTAL The synthesis and annealing of Li1.05Mn2O4~d have been described previously (6). The starting materials c-MnO2 and Li2CO3 were initially reacted at 800°C. Quenching was achieved by quickly removing the powder from the hot furnace and pressing it between two cold stainless steel plates. These samples will be called thereafter by the letter ‘T’ followed by the annealing temperature and one or two letters (SC"slow-cooled, Q"quenched). Samples investigated here are T800SC, T800Q, and T925Q. Another oxygen-deficient sample, Li4@3Mn5@3O4~d, was prepared following the procedure of Richard et al. (10). An initial sample with overall stoichiometry Li4@3Mn5@3O4 was prepared at 400°C from b-MnO2 and LiOH ) H2O: it will be named ‘‘C’’ throughout this paper. Its formula is given here 132 0022-4596/98 $25.00 Copyright ( 1998 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

As shown elsewhere (10, 11), this stoichiometry is not attainable as a pure phase. No sample with this nominal stoichiometry is single-phase: all samples reported contain Li2MnO3 as an impurity phase and have a lower a value than the 1/3 limit, with a maximum manganese oxidation state+3.9. Sample CN (for ammonia-treated) was obtained by heating sample C in flowing ammonia gas for 3 h at 200$20°C, resulting in a mass loss of +3.0%. Preliminary characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction using a Siemens D-5000 powder diffractometer equipped with a diffracted-beam monochromator and operated with CuKa radiation. Samples were analyzed both for total manganese and for manganese oxidation state by standard volumetric techniques. The X-ray characteristics and manganese valences are given in Table 1, for both parent compounds and nonstoichiometric spinel samples. Neutron diffraction was carried out on the high-resolution two-axis D2B diffractometer of Institut Laue—Langevin, Grenoble, at wavelength 1.5945 As . Samples were enclosed in vanadium containers with i.d. 9 or 16 mm, filled to a 70 mm height (corresponding to +6 and 15 g, respectively). Diffraction patterns were collected from 1° to 162° 2h with 0.05° step and a total counting time of 6 h per sample. The structures were refined from neutron powder diffraction data using the whole-pattern-fitting Fullprof program (12) (Rietveld method). RESULTS 1. Starting Model The well-known spinel structure AB2O4 crystallizes in space group Fd31 m (No. 227). Oxygen atoms occupy 32e sites with one variable position parameter x(O)"y(O)" z(O). Cations A and B both occupy special positions with no variable position parameter. A, in position 8a, and B, in 16c, are tetragonally and octahedrally coordinated by oxygen, respectively. Mixed cation occupation, especially on B-sites, is common, as in Li1`aMn2~aO4, where a fraction a of the B (octahedral) sites is occupied by A atoms, such as lithium in this example. A change in cation distribution also changes the oxidation state of manganese, which is equal to (7!a)/(2!a). A spinel is stoichiometric if the cation/anion ratio M/O is 3/4. This criterion, which is independent of occupancy normalization, will be used to ascertain whether a given sample is stoichiometric, cation-deficient (M/O(3/4) or oxygendeficient (M/O'3/4). For sufficiently high fractions of Mn3`, manganese-containing spinel oxides are known to be distorted due to the Jahn—Teller effect associated with the d4 electron configuration of trivalent manganese (1). This yields the hausmannite (Mn3O4) structure, with space group I41/amd and volume halved with respect to the initial cubic structure. 2. Quenched Li1.05Mn2O4~d Samples All samples studied gave powder patterns indexable in the cubic or tetragonal cells indicated above. The results of Rietveld refinements from neutron powder diffraction data on samples quenched from 800 and 925°C are given in Table 2, together with those for the parent (slow-cooled) compound. Observed and calculated neutron diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 1. Sample T800SC. This compound is a normal, cubic spinel. The refined lattice parameter is very close to the X-ray value (8.223 As ) and that corresponding to the nominal stoichiometry along the Li1`aMn2~aO4 solid solution (11, 13). The initial stoichiometry of this sample (Li/Mn slightly larger than 0.5) prompted us to introduce a mixed occupation of 16c octahedral sites by lithium and manganese, with the constraint of sites fully occupied. It converged to 0.06 Li#0.94 Mn on this site (a"0.12), in fairly good agreement with the chemical composition. The oxygen occupancy on 32e site was also freed and did not shift significantly from full occupation. The isotropic displacement parameters are fairly large for tetrahedral lithium and oxygen atoms, which could be an effect of the mixed cationic occupation (aO0). Sample 1800Q. This sample is still cubic, but exhibits significant differences with respect to the slow-cooled one. The lattice parameter increased significantly to 8.250 As (X-ray value: 8.245 As ), and an impurity phase, namely Li2MnO3, is weakly but significantly detected in the diffraction pattern (see Fig. 1b). A two-phase refinement showed that the lithium occupation on octahedral sites in the spinel phase is negligibly small. The atomic fractions deduced from refined site occupations show that (i) this sample is stoichiometric LiMn2O4 within experimental error (a"0); (ii) it contains ca. 3% (by weight) Li2MnO3. The decrease in lithium content (from NONSTOICHIOMETRY IN Li—Mn—O SPINEL OXIDES 133 TABLE 2 Results of Rietveld Refinements from Neutron Diffraction Data on Li1.05Mn2O4–d Samples Space group Site B*40 cell parameters (As ) Atom Site x y z occupancy (As 2) Formula Sample T800SC Fd3M m Li(1) 8a 0.125 0.125 0.125 1 0.96(11) LiM2O4 a"8.2232(4) Li(2) 16c 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.06(3) 0.27(3) M2"Mn1.88(6)Li0.12(6) z"8 Mn 16c 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.94(3) 0.27(3) O 32e 0.2633(4) 0.2633(4) 0.2633(4) 1.00(7) 0.92(1) N!P#C"2935, R1"4.58, R81"5.92, R%91"1.93, RB3!''"4.80; 41 spinel reflections used in the refinement.

The proportions of LiMn2O4 and Li2MnO3 deduced from this reaction with a"0.12 are consistent with the fractions obtained from the Rietveld refinement. This result shows that, in this temperature range, the mass loss is not due to the formation of oxygen vacancies, but corresponds to a change in spinel stoichiometry toward Li-poorer compositions, while the overall stoichiometric ratio cation/anion"3/4 is maintained. The shift to lower a and the simultaneous decrease in manganese oxidation state l(Mn) in the spinel phase are compensated by the formation of a second, lithium-richer phase Li2MnO3 and by liberation of oxygen, in agreement with thermogravimetric observations (6). Sample T925Q. Comparing Figs. 1b and 1c, one immediately notes a splitting of most spinel reflections in the latter. Its powder pattern is indexable in a hausmannite-type cell (space group I41/amd). The structure was first refined with full manganese octahedral site occupation and an overall isotropic displacement parameter. Refining these variables led to much higher R-factors than in previous cases (R81"17.0, instead of 4.93 for T800Q, see Table 2). Various attempts showed that this poor agreement was not due to cation distribution, orientation effects or a wrong space group choice. Difference Fourier maps, however, clearly show the presence of residual elongated nuclear densities near the oxygen atom site along the z direction (see Fig. 2). Introducing oxygen anisotropic displacement parameters in the structural model led to a considerable drop in reliability factors (R81"8.48). The corresponding difference pattern is given in Fig. 1c. The final bij coefficient values (see Table 2) correspond to an atomic displacement ellipsoid around the oxygen position with main axes almost parallel with the unit cell directions. The strong anisotropy in B (0.52, 0.34, and 3.19 As 2 along x, y, and z, respectively) is probably due to a static disorder of the oxygen atoms, which could be induced by the presence of vacancies. In all cases indeed, the refinement leads to a cation/anion ratio slightly larger than 3/4, corresponding to oxygen vacancies. The average manganese oxidation state is 3.35, consistent with a Jahn—Teller distorted tetragonal structure (1). The reaction between 800 and 925°C can be written (3#x)LiMn2O4P3Li1~xMn2O4~y#2xLi2MnO3#dO2 with d"1.5y!x. Such a reaction is in agreement with an increase in the Li2MnO3 content in the sample. 134 STROBEL ET AL. FIG. 1.

Ammonia-Treated Spinel As mentioned in the experimental section, sample C also contains Li2MnO3 as a second phase. This impurity is difficult to detect in the diffraction patterns, because the monoclinic Li2MnO3 structure derives from a rocksalt-type subcell with a cell parameter close to a(spinel)/2 (13), resulting in considerable overlap of reflections with the spinel ones. The structures of both samples C and CN (ammoniatreated) were refined satisfactorily with the cubic spinel model. Residuals were significantly lowered with Li2MnO3 included in the refinement. The mass fraction of the latter in sample C was found to lie in the 10—15% range. The results of refinements on samples C and CN are summarized in Table 3, and difference powder patterns are shown in Fig. 3. Regarding sample C, the tetrahedral sites were assumed fully occupied. Refining independently the Li2 and Mn occupations in the spinel phase did not result in significant shifts from (Li2#Mn)"1. These occupations were therefore constrained to full occupation of the 16d sites in the subsequent refinements. These showed that the spinel phase in sample C is stoichiometric in oxygen, within experimental errors (experimental value: 3.97(7) oxygen atoms per spinel formula unit). As expected, its cation distribution is characterized by a value of a (0.20) significantly lower than the nominal value 1/3, and corresponds to a manganese average oxidation state equal to 3.75. The stoichiometry of the spinel phase and the Li2MnO3 mass fraction are consistent with the overall composition, i.e., 6Li1.33Mn1.67Ox"5Li1.2Mn1.8O4#Li2MnO3. The oxygen position parameter is slightly lower than those observed in the high-temperature samples T800SC and T800Q; this difference can be ascribed to the higher lithium content on octahedral sites in the case of sample C. The cell parameter of Li1.2Mn1.8O4 (8.149 As ) is also significantly lower than that obtained for Li—Mn—O samples with similar stoichiometry prepared at high temperature (6, 14). In the latter case, a large fraction of Li2MnO3 is formed and the actual a value in the spinel phase is lower than 0.20. The influence of synthesis temperature on the Li/Mn ratio in Li—Mn—O spinels has been discussed recently by Endres et al. (14) and by Le Cras et al. (15). The neutron powder pattern of the ammonia-treated sample CN was refined using the same strategy. The results (see Table 3) show a number of significant changes with respect to sample C: (i) an increase in cell parameter, (ii) a significant decrease in oxygen occupancy, (iii) an increase in a value (from 0.20 to 0.28), (iv) an increase in the atomic displacement parameters of oxygen and tetrahedral lithium atoms. This refinement confirms the work of Richard et al., who concluded from X-ray data that oxygen vacancies occur in the spinel structure (9). The refined atomic occupations yield a decrease in average manganese valence in the spinel phase from 3.75 to 3.63 as a result of the ammonia treatment. Taking into account the Li2MnO3 fraction, the expected oxygen loss is then 4.1%, in fairly good agreement 136 STROBEL ET AL.

NONSTOICHIOMETRY IN Li—Mn—O SPINEL OXIDES 137 with the 3.0% weight loss measured directly. The increase in cell parameter can be ascribed to this manganese oxidation state change, since a decrease in charge on the manganese atoms results in a lengthening of the Mn—O interatomic distances. The presence of 0.067 vacancies on the oxygen sites can also explain the increased atomic displacement parameter observed on this sites, as already noted in oxygen-deficient T925Q. In the latter, this atomic displacement is markedly anisotropic. No evidence of such anisotropy is observed for sample CN. This discrepancy is probably related to another important difference between samples CN and T925Q: cubic symmetry is maintained in the former, while it is lowered to tetragonal in the latter. DISCUSSION It is interesting to compare the two processes of thermal deoxygenation and ammonia reduction in a composition— valence diagram (16). This diagram (see Fig. 4) clearly shows the important difference between the reaction mechanisms T800SCPT800Q and T800QPT925Q. The former reaction corresponds to a cation distribution rearrangement (change in Li/Mn ratio) while maintaining the spinel comFIG. 4. Composition—valence diagram for the Li—Mn—O system.

T800Q!7"average global composition of the twophase sample T800Q. position on the stoichiometric M3O4 line. In the latter reaction, in contrast, the composition leaves this line to enter the anion-defective domain. In the CPCN reaction, these two effects are combined since the oxygen extraction is accompanied by a Li/Mn increase in the spinel phase. The compensating effect of Li2MnO3 is easily demonstrated on the composition—valence diagram. As indicated for the T800SC—T800Q reaction in Fig. 4, the overall, apparent composition moves down into the anion-deficient region (dashed line to point T800Q!7) as a result of oxygen loss. This point, however, does not represent an actual phase composition, but rather the center of gravity of the twophase mixture T800Q (which actually lies on the stoichiometric spinel line)#Li2MnO3. Finally, this diagram also displays the Jahn-Teller distortion limit (just below the 3.5 manganese valence line), which is crossed here in sample T925Q, but not in sample CN. CONCLUSION We showed in this study that lithium manganese spinel oxides can indeed lose oxygen, either by annealing and quenching at high temperature, or by low-temperature treatment with a reducing gas such as ammonia. The solid—gas equilibrium, however, is more complex than a simple oxygen extraction from a host with constant cation composition: the oxygen content variation is always accompanied by simultaneous changes in (i) Li/Mn ratio in the spinel phase and (ii) the proportion of Li2MnO3 present in the system. The flexibility of the spinel structure, with variable B-site cation distribution, makes the mechanism of oxygen exchange in this system quite different from that in perovskite-related cuprates such as the YBa2Cu3O7~x system, where the oxygen content can be varied in a wide range without change in cation occupations (17—19).

Unfortunately, these materials suffer severe capacity fade on cycling, among other performance issues. While ion substitution can improve the performance of many of these materials, the underlying mechanisms of property modification are not completely understood. In this work we show enhanced performance of the Li1+zMO2 electrode, consisting of Li2MnO3 (with C2/m space group) and LiMO2 (with R3̅m space group) phases, and establish the effects of cationic and anionic substitution on the phase and structure evolution underpinning performance changes. While the undoped material has a high capacity of ∼270 mAh·g−1, only 79% of this remains after 200 cycles. Including ∼2% Cr in the material, likely at the R3̅m metal (3a) site, improved cycle performance by ∼13%, and including ∼5% F in the material, likely at the R3̅m oxygen (6c) site, enhanced capacity by ∼4−5% at the expense of a ∼12% decline in cycle performance. Moreover, Cr doping enhances energy density retention by ∼13%, and F doping suppresses this by 17%. We find that these changes arise by different mechanisms. Both anionic and cationic substitution promote faster Li diffusion, by 48% and 20%, respectively, as determined using cyclic voltammetry and leading to better rate performance. Unlike anionic substitution, cationic substitution enhances structural stability at the expense of some capacity, by suppressing lattice distortion during Li insertion and extraction. This work implicates strategic cationic−anionic codoping for enhanced electrochemical performance in lithium-rich layered metal-oxide phases. ■INTRODUCTION Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most promising energystorage technology for electric and plug-in hybrid-electric vehicle applications; however, the energy density of existing LIB technology needs to improve to meet emerging market requirements.1−3 The major bottleneck for this improvement is the positive electrode, with the first commercialized and commonly used LIB positive electrode material, LiCoO2, now superseded by stoichiometric LiNixCo1−x−yMnyO2 (such as LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2)4,5 and its Li-rich siblings Li1+zNixCo1−x−y−zMnyO2 (commonly appearing as the composite xLi2MnO3·(1 −x)LiMO2, with M = Ni, Co, Mn).6−10 These are a technologically important class of positive electrodes, offering the possibility for higher energy density at reduced cost. In particular, the Li1+xMO2 or xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiMO2 (where M are transition metals) material has been reported with various phases, including as a single Li1+xMO2 phase and as a two-phase system with a main LiMO2 phase containing nanodomains of Li2MnO3.6−10 Single-phase Li1+xMO2 is reported with R3̅m space group symmetry and stacking faults in the lithium/manganese layers along the caxis,6 as well with monoclinic C2/m space group symmetry.11 The main phase of the two-phase system is reported with R3̅m space group symmetry that contains an intergrowth of a monoclinic Li2MnO3-like phase with C2/m space group symmetry, with these phases heterointerface in particle grains.8 Received: July 17, 2017 Revised: November 23, 2017 Published: November 27, 2017 Article pubs.acs.org/cm Cite This: Chem.

Although neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data suffers from lower spatial resolution than X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data, NPD offers better elemental contrast for Li1+xMO2 over XRPD. The coherent neutron scattering lengths for the elements commonly found in this material, Li, Cr, Ni, Mn, and Co, are −1.9, 3.6, 10.3, −3.7, and 2.5 × 10−15 m, respectively. Despite this, the use of NPD to study Li1+xMO2 is relatively rare, perhaps as a result of difficulties accessing the limited neutron facilities. Previous work investigated the structure of the Li1+xMO2 material using NPD data at two wavelengths combined with XRPD data to help address the spatial resolution limitations of NPD.12 This work found that the combined NPD and XRPD observations could only be described using a two-phase compositional model with a main layered R3̅m LiMO2 phase and C2/m Li2MnO3 second phase. Despite their structural complexity, Li1+xMO2 materials are attracting increasing attention as LIB positive electrodes due to their low cost/toxicity and high capacity of ∼250−280 mAh· g−1,13−15 and because they suffer from severe voltage decay issues thought to originate from a 3 V transformation to a spinel-like phase.16−18 Cation mixing caused by the similar ionic radii of Ni2+ and Li+ possibly also leads to unsatisfactory rate and cycle performance at high currents. The mechanism of capacity fade in Li1+xMO2 has been studied by several researchers.15−19 Using the combination of in operando NPD and synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy, particle cracking in combination with grain boundary movement was revealed to underpin capacity fade.12 Similarly, Song et al. report that phase separation is responsible for the gradual reduction in discharge voltage.17 It is also reported that cycle deterioration can be suppressed by precycling treatment during which the upper limit of 4.5 V is increased by 0.1 V every two cycles to 4.8 V during initial cycling.20 The pretreatment at lower voltages was shown to reduce structural changes and surface microcracking, improving cycle stability.20 The electrochemical performance of LiNixCo1−x−yMnyO2 can also be enhanced by structure modification via doping with foreign elements such as alkaline earth metals,21−23 transition metals,24−27 rare earth metals,28,29 and halogen elements.30−33 Despite the complicated Ni:Co:Mn doping in LiNixCo1−x−yMnyO2 or Li1+zNixCo1−x−y−zMnyO2, cationic substitution for Ni2+ can stabilize the structure and reduce Li/Ni mixing, thereby modifying electrochemical performance.21−29 Where a relatively large radius dopant is incorporated, an increase in the material’s c lattice parameter has been observed and correlated with decreased transfer resistance.29 Anionic substitution with halogens such as F for O has also been useful in altering grain size and improving crystallinity, as well as stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface and thereby improving cycle performance.30−33 The resulting electronic modification is also reported to hinder the loss of O through the relatively stronger F-metal bond in Li-rich compounds.33 While these doping strategies can be effective in modifying electrochemical behavior, the potential existence of nanodomains of Li2MnO3 and LiMO2 components8−10 as well as complex doping in single-phase Li1+xMO2 7 leads to difficulties in establishing the link between doping and electrochemical performance. In this work, we use NPD to study the phase and structure of pristine, Cr-doped, and F-doped Li1.2Ni0.23Co0.12Mn0.5O2 positive lithium-ion battery electrodes and their evolution during battery cycling and establish their structure−function relationship. ■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION A study of Li1.2Ni0.23Co0.12Mn0.5O2 with 2% Cr and 5% F was chosen on the basis of preliminary performance tests at 1 C. Tests of 1, 2, and 3% Cr revealed that 2% Cr induced the smallest first cycle irreversibility. Tests of 5, 7.5, and 10% F revealed 5% F to yield the highest capacity and best rate capability (see Figure S1). Pristine, Cr-doped, and F-doped Li1.2Ni0.23Co0.12Mn0.5O2 are termed LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM, respectively. LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM powders were synthesized via a carbonate coprecipitation process. Stoichiometric amounts of manganese sulfate (MnSO4· H2O), nickel sulfate (NiSO4·7H2O), and cobalt sulfate (CoSO4· 7H2O) were dissolved in deionized water and used as the starting materials. The starting materials were added dropwise into a continuously stirred reactor tank, into which Na2CO3 as precipitator and NH4OH as chelating agent were separately fed. The solutions were maintained at 60 °C, a pH of 7.5−8.5, and 800 revolutions per minute stirring. After formation, the spherical carbonate precursor powders were filtered, washed, and dried at 120 °C. The carbonate precursors were then mixed with the required amount of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and calcined at 900 °C in air for 16 h to form black powder LNCM. Fluorine and chromium were doped into the LNCM powders by mixing and calcining with appropriate amounts of NH4F and Cr(NO3)3·H2O, respectively. The mixtures were thoroughly ground and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in air to produce F-LNCM and Cr-LNCM. A lower temperature (600 °C) was used in the postannealing to maintain parental LNCM form. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data over the 2θ range 10−80° with a step size of 0.02° were collected for as-prepared LNCM, CrLNCM, and F-LNCM powders using an X’pert Pro with CuKα radiation. High-resolution neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data of LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM were obtained using ECHIDNA, the high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer with 1.6211(5) Å neutrons (determined using the La11B6 NIST standard reference material 660b) at the Open Pool Australian Light-water (OPAL) research reactor at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO).34 NPD data were obtained over the 2θ range 6.5−164° with a step size of 0.05°. GSAS-II35 was employed to perform Rietveld analysis of the high-resolution NPD data, where the refined parameters included background coefficients, zero-shift, peak shape parameters, lattice parameters, atomic positional parameters, atomic displacement parameters (Uiso), and site occupancy factors. The data were described successfully by a two-phase model using a main hexagonal R3̅m phase10,29 and a secondary monoclinic C2/m phase.6,9 In the refinement the atomic concentrations of atoms were initially set to the target values, and the total occupancy of each site was constrained to unity. The zero shift in the final refinements varied between −0.06(1) and −0.08(2). The morphology of the as-synthesized samples was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with a Hitachi SU8000 operated at 15 keV. Elemental weight fractions were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, S-35, Kontron). To perform ICP-AES measurements, the samples were digested in Aqua Regia (HNO3 + 3 HCl) and further diluted with deionized water. LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM powders were used as active materials in coin cells by mixing with conductive carbon (Super P) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 in an adequate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The mixed slurry was coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 80 °C for 1 h to evaporate the organic solvent. The coated foil was roll-pressed and dried at 100 °C for 12 h in a vacuum furnace to obtain the electrode. The electrodes were assembled into CR2032-type coin cells with Li metal as the counter electrode and 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a 1:1 mixture by volume of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the electrolyte for electrochemical characterizations. Coin cells were assembled in a glovebox under an argon atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1 mV·s−1 over 2.0−5.0 V (vs Li) using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (PG302N). The CVs of the batteries Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02930 Chem. Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10300 at second cycle were used to calculate the lithium diffusivity. Further electrochemical testing within the voltage window 2.0−4.8 V (vs Li) was performed using a Maccor series 4000 (U.S.A.). Cycle performance tests were also conducted using full-configuration coin cells with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as the counter electrode in the voltage window 0.5−3.3 V (vs LTO). The specific capacity of the cells was calculated using the weight of active positive electrode material. In operando NPD measurements were performed using standard 18650-type full batteries. The 18650 full batteries with Celgard separator were prepared by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan. LNCM and LTO electrodes for these full batteries were prepared by casting a slurry of active material (80 wt %), acetylene black (10 wt %), and PVDF binder (10 wt %), dissolved in NMP onto Al foil using a double-sided coating machine. The single sided coating thicknesses of LNCM and LTO were 62 and 139 μm, respectively, resulting in a LNCM:LTO loading of 1:1.13 (mAh) with LNCM being the limiting material. Electrode dimensions of 85 × 5.5 cm2 were rolled with two layers of separator, and each battery contained ∼5 g electrolyte. In operando NPD data of the 18650-type batteries were collected using WOMBAT,36 the high-intensity neutron powder diffractometer at the OPAL research reactor at ANSTO. The 18650-type batteries are an ideal geometry for the WOMBAT diffractometer and were galvanostatically charged and discharged at 0.1 A between 0.5 and 3.3 V (vs. LTO). The charge−discharge process was performed using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (PG302N) under ambient conditions, with the external temperature maintained at 22.5 °C. A neutron beam with a wavelength of 2.4123(2) Å was used, determined using the La11B6 NIST Standard Reference Material 660b. The diffractograms were obtained with an exposure time of 1 min per pattern in the angular range 16.1−136.9° during charge−discharge cycling. Single-peak fitting of the LNCM 012 and LTO 222 reflections was performed using the Large Array Manipulation Program.37 ■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The molar fractions of elements obtained from ICP-AES for the as-synthesized LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM materials are shown in Table 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure S2) shows that the doping processes do not influence the LNCM morphology or average particle size. As-synthesized LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM materials were characterized using both laboratory XRPD and highresolution NPD. The XRPD data are shown in Figure S3 and the Rietveld refinement profiles using NPD data are shown in Figure 1a−c. The XRPD data for all the as-prepared samples are nearly identical, with sharp reflections. Unlike similar Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 samples with Li:M varying between 1.2 and 1.8,11 XRPD data of our samples was unable to be indexed by a monoclinic C2/m space group and instead was indexed to a hexagonal phase with R3̅m space group, in agreement with other work.10 In addition to well-defined sharp peaks, the appearance of a broad feature at 20−22° 2θ was observed, as consistent with other work.6−10 The ratio of the R3̅m phase 003 and 104 reflection intensities is calculated to be nearly unity, which indicates that the main phase is a typical layered structure with a low level of Li/Ni cation mixing, in which the (003) plane is shared by all metal ions and the (104) plane is occupied by all the elements in the material.

Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02930 Chem. Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10301 splitting of the 006 and 102 reflections as well as the 018 and 110 reflections, characteristic for the R3̅m layered structure, is observed, further evidencing low levels of cation mixing.38,39 While the NPD data of all samples could be indexed to a monoclinic C2/m space group, a phase with a R3̅m layered structure was used initially to model the NPD data, as informed by our XRPD data. The R3̅m layered structure described most NPD reflections except for those at ∼44−45° and ∼112° in 2θ, which are indexed by the 040/221̅ and the 225̅/082/511̅/280 reflections, respectively, of the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase (as shown for LNCM in Figures S4 and S5). Therefore, the only model that adequately describes both our XRPD and NPD data of LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM samples is a two phase composition with a main LiMO2 phase with R3̅m space group10 and a second Li2MnO3 phase with C2/m space group.6,9 Rietveld refinement of structural models containing the LiMO2 and Li2MnO3 phases against the NPD data reveal a weight ratio of ∼4:1 for these phases, respectively, and excluding the Li2MnO3 phase from the structural model of the NPD data causes the Rwp figure of merit to rise substantially, from ∼4.6% to 11.7% for the LNCM sample data. The contributions from the individual phases to the final refinement profile are shown in Figure S5. The two-phase nature of these composite electrodes is in good agreement with previous work demonstrating that bulk Li1+zNixCo1−x−y−zMnyO2 commonly presents as LiMO2 particles intergrown with a Li2MnO3 phase.8,12 The crystal structure details of the R3̅m and C2/m phases obtained from Rietveld refinement using the high-resolution NPD data are provided in Table 2 and Table S1, respectively. LiMO2 and Li2MnO3 in the LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM samples remain in a ∼4:1 weight ratio, respectively. The undoped LCNM is therefore found to be 0.15(8)Li2MnO3· 0.85(8)Li1.21(4)Ni0.27(4)Co0.13(3)Mn0.39(3)O2. NPD data analysis of the doped materials revealed the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase to retain the same lattice parameters (within 1 standard error) as that of the pristine LNCM material. Within the R3̅m layered LiMO2 phase, the c lattice parameter increases on doping with F, differing by more than four standard errors from the undoped material. Partial substitution of F for O within the LiMO2 layered phase is expected to lead to charge deficiency and a consequential decrease in the attraction between M (and Li) and O, resulting in an expansion of the M(Li)O6 octahedron and an increase in the c lattice parameter, in good agreement with our findings and those of Kageyama et al.31 The similar neutron coherent scattering lengths of F and O (5.6 and 5.8 × 10−15 m, respectively) complicate the crystallographic determination of F within the material phases. Inclusion of 5% F at either O site of the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase or at the O site of the layered LiMO2 phase did not change significantly the fit of the model to the NPD data of FLNCM. As guided by the expected lattice parameter response, Rietveld refinement of the LiMO2 phase with 5% F at the O site yielded a site occupancy factor in agreement with the nominal synthetic doping level. Hence, the best model of the NPD data is with F doping at the O site of the LiMO2 phase forming a material of formula 0.15(16)Li2MnO3·0.85(16)Li1.20(5)Ni0.24(5)Co0.13(4)Mn0.43(4)O1.90(6)F0.10(6). The lattice parameters of both LiMO2 and Li2MnO3 phases are relatively unchanged on Cr doping, a result consistent with the similar ionic radius of Cr3+ compared to the average of Ni2+, Co3+, and Mn4+.40 Although NPD yields excellent contrast between the transition metals, the high level of codoping still presents an obstacle for the determination of Cr as it closely approaches the limit of detection (about 1%) of the technique. As limited by the estimated standard error for site occupancy factors, we tested several models for the inclusion of Cr within the two phases of the Cr-LNCM sample against the NPD data. Excluding Cr altogether or including Cr at the Li site within the layered LiMO2 phase and the Mn site within the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase all caused an increase in the goodness of fit of the model to the NPD data. The best description of the data was found by a model with Cr at the transition metal site (3a) within the main layered phase. The refined site occupancy factor for Cr at this site yields a composition that is consistent with both the nominal concentration of the dopant in the synthesis and the ICP-AES results (Table 1), indicating a material composition with formula 0.15(9)Li2MnO3·0.85(9)Li1.25(5)Ni0.26(5)Co0.11(4)Mn0.38(4)Cr0.01(4)O2. Given the challenges of structural characterization of such low-level dopants, we cannot rule out the possibility that minute amounts of F and Cr may be present in the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase. The LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM materials are nearly indistinguishable in terms of their phase ratio, level of Li/Ni cation mixing in the LiMO2 phase, particle size, or morphology. It is generally accepted that lithium ions diffuse along the ab plane within the R3̅m phase.41 We study the lithium diffusion Table 2.

Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10302 pathway by examining nuclear density arising from the lithium, obtained by Fourier difference methods using high resolution NPD data and the refined R3̅m structure with lithium at 3b sites removed. The nuclear density arising from Li overlaid with the refined R3̅m structure (Figure 2) suggests that in all three electrodes lithium diffuses between adjacent octahedral 3b sites via 6c tetrahedral sites. This mechanism is similar to the socalled tetrahedral site hopping reported for such R3̅m electrodes41 in which 6c tetrahedral sites located at (2/3, 1/3, ∼0.45) lower than the energy barrier for jump diffusion between 3b sites in a similar manner to that reported for sodium within O3-type electrodes.42 First-principles calculations41 also suggested the existence of such interstitial tetrahedral sites as necessary to lower the energy barrier for Li diffusion along the ab plane within O3-type LixCoO2. Our observation of Li at the 6c site with coordinates (2/3, 1/3, ∼0.45) is the first reported for the LNCM material. Lithium generally diffuses by jump-diffusion in solids where the lithium diffusion coefficient is proportional to the hop frequency and the square of the hop distance.43 The distance between the 6c and 3b Li sites, between neighboring 3b Li sites, as well as the Li−O and M−O bond lengths are summarized in Table 3. In LNCM, the Li3b−Li3b and Li3b−Li6c jump distances are increased by both Cr and F-doping but are largest for the anionic doping case. For lithium to diffuse within the ab plane, its interaction with oxygen needs to be broken. Bond lengths are inversely proportional to strength,44,45 and the hop frequency for lithium is expected to increase with increasing Li−O distance. The Li−O bond length in LNCM is shortened by Cr doping and relatively unaffected by F doping. Taken together, these differences predict increased Li diffusion in Fand Cr-LNCM, expected to be largest in F-LNCM. Figure 3 shows similar typical initial CVs of the LNCM, CrLNCM, and F-LNCM composite electrodes within coin cells obtained at a scan rate of 0.2 mV·s−1 between 2.0 and 5.0 V (vs Li). In the first charge, two main anodic peaks occurring at ∼4.3 and 4.5 V correspond to the concomitant oxidation of Ni within LiMO2 and the electrochemical activation of Li2MnO3.6,9 In successive CV curves, the redox behavior of Mn and Ni are clearly observed, with the polarization between redox features in the CV curves similar between the samples. The redox couple Co3+/Co4+ is relatively insignificant, possibly due to the relatively small amount of Co present.46 Although it has been suggested that Cr3+ can be electrochemically active,47−50 we do not observe additional anodic or cathodic features in the CV data of Cr-LNCM. This may be due to the small amount of Cr3+, which if active, we estimate the 3electron reaction would contribute only ∼13.8 mAh·g−1 to the battery capacity. The diffusivity of lithium during the Ni2+/Ni4+ oxidation process was calculated from the anodic CVs of the second cycle (Figure 4a−c), where a linear relationship between the peak current and the square root of the scanning rate is found (Figure 4d). The Randles-Sevcik equation (eq 1), = × · · · · I A C D n v 2.69 10 p 5 1/2 3/2 1/2 (1) relates the specific peak current (Ip in A·g−1) to the geometrical surface area51 of the electrode (A = 1.70 cm2, where the diameter of the electrode is 1.47 cm), the shuttle concentration (C ∼0.0493 mol·cm−3, obtained using the molecular volume in Table 2), the charge-transfer number of electrons involved in the redox process (n = 2), the scan rate (ν in V·s−1), and the lithium ion diffusion coefficient (D, in cm2·s−1).

The lithium diffusion coefficient for all samples is of the same order of magnitude as that previously reported for LNCM, being ∼10−11 cm2·s−1.16 F-LNCM exhibits the largest lithium diffusion coefficient of 3.7(2) × 10−11 cm2·s−1, 48(5)% higher than for the pristine LNCM. This result is consistent with that predicted by the structural changes identified by high resolution NPD analysis discussed earlier. Figure 5a−c shows the charge−discharge curves of coin cells containing the LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM composite electrodes in the range 2.0−4.8 V (vs Li) during an asymmetric cycling profile with various charge (C) and discharge (D) currents. In the first two cycles, 0.1 C (and 0.1 D) was the lowest rate used to activate the Li2MnO3 component and gain the full capacity of the electrode in the following cycles. For LNCM (Figure 5a), the initial specific charge and discharge capacity are ∼341 and ∼262 mAh·g−1, respectively, constituting a coulombic efficiency of ∼77%. This irreversible capacity loss is revealed in the CV for the first cycle above 4.5 V by a large anodic peak, corresponding to the electrochemical activation of Li2MnO3 involving the evolution of oxygen. In the second cycle, the activation of Li2MnO3 is complete,6,9 and the coulombic efficiency increases to ∼99%, with the specific charge and discharge capacities being ∼266 and ∼263 mAh·g−1, respectively. Cr-LNCM (Figure 5b) exhibits an initial specific discharge capacity of ∼258 mAh·g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency that is similar to LNCM. In contrast, F-LNCM (Figure 5c) exhibits a specific discharge capacity of ∼274 mAh· g−1 and a coulombic efficiency of ∼86%, demonstrating the smallest initial irreversible capacity loss of the three electrodes, possibly as a result of electronic structure changes postulated to inhibit the loss of oxygen.31−33 It has been reported that a layer of FePO4 or porous Co3O4 coating can be used as an intermediate host to accommodate the Li+ extracted from the Li2MnO3 matrix, with the Li+ unable to intercalate back into MnO2 after forming electrochemically active LixFePO4 and LixCoOy.52,53 These coatings achieve an initial discharge Figure 3.

Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10304 capacity of ∼180 mAh·g−1 without significant irreversible capacity loss. In our work, F doping achieves an initial discharge capacity of more than 270 mAh·g−1, approaching the theoretical value, and an initial irreversible capacity loss of ∼14%. Following the initial Li2MnO3 activation cycle, the cells were cycled in the narrower 2.0−4.6 V (vs Li) window to reduce the possibility of electrolyte decomposition at higher voltages. LNCM exhibited discharge capacities of 242.8, 229.0, 214.0, and 199.9 mAh·g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 D, respectively, higher than those for Cr-LNCM of 230.5, 211.0, 192.9, and 183 mAh· g−1, respectively, possibly due to a smaller number of redoxactive centers (∼1.3% less than for LNCM, Table S2). In contrast, F-LNCM has a similar number of redox-active centers to LNCM, but delivered better rate performance with discharge capacities of 246.4, 234.6, 223.8, and 208.9 mAh·g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 D rates, respectively, likely as a result of faster lithium diffusion through the material. During discharge, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 D rates were chosen to compare the rate performance of the three samples. The electrochemical performances of the LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM composite electrodes were further tested in fullconfiguration coin cells using the widely studied Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) counter electrode, for consistency with the in operando NPD results. Compared with the Li counter electrode in half cells, LTO has a higher redox potential of ∼1.55 V (vs Li), reducing the energy density of the battery, with this being the only difference to using a Li counter electrode. Figure 6a−c presents the charge−discharge curves of these full-configuration coin cells at a 0.2 C and 0.5 D rates up to 200 cycles, following two formation cycles at 0.1 C and 0.1 D between 0.5 and 3.3 V (vs LTO). Figure 6d shows the corresponding capacity retention and the coulombic efficiency (data in selected cycles are shown in Table S3) up to 200 cycles. Interestingly, the CrLNCM and F-LNCM containing batteries exhibited the best and worst cycle performance, respectively, retaining ∼90% and ∼70% of capacity, respectively, after 200 cycles, compared with ∼79% for the undoped material. Compared to other studies, the capacity decay rate that we measure is reasonably small for this material at such high rates.54 For example, Kobayashi et al. report a capacity retention of ∼89% after only 30 cycles at 0.1 C for the unmodified material.54 Cycle performance is also closely connected with voltage fade (Figure 6e), which is a problem typical for these electrodes, thought to originate from a transformation to a spinel-like phase at 3 V (vs Li).16−18 Voltage decay is defined as Figure 5.

Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10305 = − V n V Voltage decay ( th cycle) (10th cycle) (2) where the V for the nth cycle is the average discharge potential as calculated by dividing the discharge energy by the discharge capacity. Compared with the undoped LNCM, Cr doping has almost no effect on voltage decay up to 100 cycles and only beyond this does the Cr-doped material exhibit pronounced voltage decay. F doping increases the severity of the voltage decay immediately relative to the undoped material. The effects of Cr and F doping on voltage decay are even more pronounced after 200 cycles, with the Cr-LNCM showing a decay of 0.081 V and F-LNCM showing the large decay of 0.149 V. F-LNCM demonstrated the worst cycle performance and Cr-LNCM the best cycle performance, an interesting result. While small amounts of F in Li-rich materials are reported to enhance cycle performance,31−33 this does not occur for our F-LNCM, possibly due to the relatively higher doping level. For example, doping of F at higher levels into LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2−xFx decreased cycle performance due to the formation of a new unstable interface, as well as structural instability arising from the nonequivalent substitution of F for O.31 Similarly, within Li(Li0.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 the incorporation of 5% F was better for cycle performance than 10% F, where the F doping is reported to improve cycling stability of the layered phase through stabilization of the host structure.33 The main contribution of F is postulated in the material to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface by maintaining interfacial resistances.33 However, in our work, F-LNCM did not perform better in cycling stability tests, and this discrepancy may be due the asymmetric charge−discharge (0.2 C/0.5 D) used in our work and/or the limited voltage range (2.0−4.6 V vs Li) after activation of Li2MnO3. To further characterize voltage decay, specific energies were calculated from the discharge curves and are shown in Figure 6f. Noting that the working potential of these batteries is 1.5 V less than for the equivalent half cells as a result of the LTO counter electrode; the batteries deliver ∼400 mWh·g−1 at the 10th cycle, with the undoped material delivering ∼313 mWh· g−1 after 200 cycles, compared with ∼355 (∼13% higher) and ∼261 mWh·g−1 (∼17% lower) for batteries containing CrLNCM and F-LNCM, respectively. We consider two possible mechanisms for the enhancement of structural stability by Cr. First, electrochemically active Cr3+ may be oxidized to Cr6+, with the quasi-reversible migration of Cr6+ at the R3̅m phase 3a site onto the 3b (Li) site mitigating voltage decay.47−50 In this scenario, the suppression of voltage decay was previously found to occur on charge but not discharge,47 where our results show Cr suppressed voltage decay on discharge. The second possible mechanism for the enhancement of structure stability by Cr is that Cr is electrochemically inactive, with these inactive MO6 centers Figure 7. (a) Contour plot of in operando NPD data of LNCM-containing batteries and (b) results of single-peak fitting of the LiMO2 012 reflection. Chemistry of Materials Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02930 Chem. Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10306 stabilizing the structure and reducing voltage decay. This possibility is consistent with the absence of features arising from the Cr3+/Cr6+ redox couple in our CV data and the small drop in capacity as a result of the absence of the 3-electron reaction. In light of the insensitivity of our NPD data to the migration of Cr into the Li layer at this low doping level (Figure S8), we cannot rule out the possibility of Cr redox activity in our Cr-LNMO. We note that the discrepancy between previously reported Cr activity and our results may arise from material composition differences such as the fraction of the Li2MnO3 phase and transition metal doping, as well as differences in the upper voltage cutoff. A comparative investigation of the phase and structural evolution of the LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM materials within batteries containing LTO as the counter electrode was performed using in operando neutron powder diffraction (NPD). Contour plots of data for each battery in a selected 2θ region are shown in Figure 7a, showing the evolution of the LiMO2 012 and LTO 222 reflections during the first charge and discharge. The batteries were standard 18650-type with ∼5 g conventional organic electrolyte and Celgard separator, resulting in a significant background contribution arising from the hydrogen in these components. Consequently, given the relatively lower symmetry and smaller amount of Li2MnO3 in the battery, this component was not observable. The in operando NPD data were analyzed using single peak fitting of the LiMO2 012 reflection, the results of which are shown in Figure 7b, and single peak fitting of the LTO 222 reflection, the results of which are shown in Figure S6. The NPD data reveal that the LiMO2 phase in LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM electrodes exhibits a similar solid-solution type reaction during charge and discharge. Upon charging to 3.0 V (vs LTO), the LiMO2 012 reflection position shifts to higher 2θ, consistent with lattice shrinkage during lithium extraction. At 3.0 V (vs LTO) and above, the Li2MnO3 component is activated and the LiMO2 012 reflection remains nearly unchanged in position, shifting only marginally to lower 2θ. On discharge to 2.5 V (vs LTO), again no significant shift in position of the LiMO2 012 reflection was observed. These results are similar to that reported for the undoped LNCM material by Chen et al.12 We quantify the structural response of electrodes to lithium extraction in each of the LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM containing batteries by examining the rate of change (° per min) and maximum change (°) of the LiMO2 012 reflection position. Following the first charge−discharge, the LNCM, CrLNCM, and F-LNCM materials exhibit reproducible charge− discharge curves in subsequent cycles, and therefore a comparison of the LiMO2 structural response occurring in the first discharge between the three samples can be used to understand differences in cycle performance. Single-peak fitting of the LiMO2 012 reflection in NPD data obtained during the first charge at a constant current of 1.0 A from open-circuit voltage (OCV) to 2.8 V (vs LTO) reveals a rate of change of position of 4.55(7), 4.09(7), and 4.14(7)° per min for LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM containing batteries, respectively (Figure S7). The maximum shift of the LiMO2 012 reflection during this time is 0.14(1), 0.11(1), and 0.12(1)° for LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM containing batteries, respectively. The LiMO2 012 reflection changes more slowly and less on charge in the Cr-LNCM and F-LNCM containing batteries than for the undoped LNCM containing battery. Conversely, on lithiation during discharge from 2.6 to 2.0 V (vs LTO), the rate of change of the LiMO2 012 reflection position was −3.22(3), −3.28(3), and −3.43(3)° per min for the LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM containing batteries, respectively (Figure S7). The maximum shift of the LiMO2 012 reflection during this time is 0.12(1), 0.14(1), and 0.15(1)° for LNCM, Cr-LNCM, and F-LNCM containing batteries, respectively.

Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10307 position occurring during discharge therefore occurs for the FLNCM containing battery, pointing to structural instability. We further explore the structural changes occurring in the three LNCM electrodes by the degree of structural distortion in the transition metal oxygen octahedron of the LiMO2 phase by calculating the oxygen positional parameter, z. Although the NPD data do not support refinement of the oxygen positional parameter directly, it can be studied through the intensity of the LiMO2 012 reflection. NPD patterns were simulated for LiMO2 using the crystallographic details as shown in Table 2 with an oxygen positional parameter varying from z = 0.251 to 0.275, establishing the relationship between the LiMO2 012 reflection intensity and z (Figure 8a,b). The simulation results assume a constant oxygen level in the layered LiMO2 phase, as supported by work revealing that oxygen loss occurs from the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase,55 where the reflection intensity change is associated with repositioning of the O. We note that our previous work12 on this system revealed a reflection from the MnO2 delithiation product of Li2MnO3; however, we did not see this reflection in this work due to the use of hydrogenated electrolyte. Figure 8c depicts this octahedral distortion as z changes from 0.251 to 0.275, giving rise to a change in the O− M−O bond angle from 89.80 to 101.34°. The relationship between reflection intensity and z for the Crand F-LNCM is plotted in Figure S9. The LiMO2 012 reflection intensity drops nonlinearly with z, where a larger change in intensity is associated with a correspondingly larger octahedral distortion. This simulation clearly reveals that the Cr-LNCM electrode, which maintains the highest LiMO2 012 reflection intensity, exhibits the lowest octahedral distortion, implying that it is high structural stability underpinning its better cycle performance. Although structural instability is not necessarily implicated by a lattice change, the magnitude of expansion or contraction during lithiation/delithiation processes directly correlates with strain, which is known to lead to performance decay on cycling. The relatively larger structural change in the LiMO2 component of the F-doped electrode during discharge points to structural instability, likely explaining the poor cycle performance of this material. In contrast, while low-level doping of Cr doping does not significantly change the original lattice or enhance Li diffusivity or capacity, it results in less structural change during cycling. Scheme 1 summarizes the effects of Cr and F substitution on the structure and electrochemical performance of the LNCM positive electrode. In summary, F and Cr are believed to substitute into the R3̅m layered LiMO2 phase. Cr substitution does not have a major impact on the phase lattice parameter or lithium diffusivity through the material but enhances cycling performance and reduces the voltage decay at the expense of a small amount of capacity. On the other hand, F substitution results in a significant expansion of the LiMO2 phase lattice and faster lithium diffusion through the material, leading to greater capacity and rate performance. However, the cycling performance is reduced by F as a result of a greater structural change in the LiMO2 phase during cycling. ■CONCLUSIONS The effects of doping Cr and F into the lithium-rich layered metal oxide Li1.2Ni0.23Co0.12Mn0.5O2 positive electrode material on battery performance and structural evolution was examined. Neutron and X-ray powder diffraction supported that doping with 2% Cr and 5% F did not change the electrode phase composition of 80 wt % R3̅m and 20 wt % C2/m space-group symmetry components, and microscopy measurements revealed that the dopants did not alter significantly the particle size or morphology of the electrode powders. Crystallographically, structural characterization points to Cr and F doping occurring in the main layered R3̅m phase, with Cr doping thought to occur at the 3a transition-metal site and not significantly affecting the lattice, and F-doping thought to occur at the 6c oxygen site and significantly increasing the c lattice parameter. Electrochemically, F-doping enhanced capacity and rate performance, postulated to occur as a result of enhanced Li diffusivity achieved by an increase in Li site hop distance. Crdoping suppressed capacity and rate performance. However, long-cycle testing of full configuration batteries revealed very poor cycle performance of the F-doped material, with only ∼64% capacity retention and ∼68% energy density after 200 cycles under a 0.2 C/0.5 D asymmetric cycle profile, in contrast to the enhancement of both cycle performance and voltage decay achieved by Cr-doping. These apparently contradictory results are explained by in operando neutron powder diffraction data which revealed a structural change of the LiMO2 phase that was enhanced by F-doping, suggesting structural instability Scheme 1.

Mater. 2017, 29, 10299−10311 10308 on cycling, in comparison to the suppression of the LiMO2 structural change achieved by Cr-doping. This work establishes the chemistry−and structure−function relations for the lithium-rich layered metal oxide Li1.2Ni0.23Co0.12Mn0.5O2 and the roles of both anionic (F) and cationic (Cr) doping on this. Anionic substitution with F promotes a larger crystal lattice, resulting in faster Li diffusion, as well as higher capacity and rate performance. Cationic substitution with Cr promotes structural stability, at the expense of some capacity. Given these differences, codoping is implicated as a possible future strategy for combining the benefits of these dopants for optimized electrochemical performance. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02930.

K. Sharma,d A. K. Srivastavad and Archana Singh *a,b The rapid development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts is essential for the oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, nanostructured spinels LiMn2O4, delithiated λ-MnO2, and Li4Mn5O12 have been synthesized at low temperatures and are investigated as electrocatalysts for alkaline water oxidation reactions. Among the nanostructured spinels, LiMn2O4, delithiated λ-MnO2, and Li4Mn5O12, the former spinel which is classical LiMn2O4 with 1/6th of the Mn replaced by Li outperforms for the OER that shows a current density of 5 mA cm−2 at a lowest overpotential of 430 mV and Tafel slope of 74 mV per decade. Electrochemical impedance studies revealed the least value of charge transfer resistance of the Li4Mn5O12 spinel and suggest fast reaction kinetics for the oxygen evolution reaction as compared to other spinels. The XPS and TEM of Li4Mn5O12, recorded after a 12-hour stability test for oxygen evolution activity, confirm that the oxidation state of Mn and the morphology of Li4Mn5O12 remain intact even after the electrocatalytic reaction, however, it undergoes amorphization. The higher activity of Li4Mn5O12 synthesized in the present work is attributed to the low temperature synthesis resulting in the formation of a nanostructured Li rich spinel with a high surface area, along with an increased percentage of ionic bonding and the presence of 3D Li diffusion channels. The role of Li was further supported by XPS studies that revealed a shift in Li 1s binding energy as well as quantitative reduction relative to Mn for Li4Mn5O12 after a long term test. 1. Introduction Elemental hydrogen produced from a rich natural source of water is essential for sustainable growth. Using hydrogen alternatives to fossil fuels ensures a green future especially if the source of the obtained hydrogen is renewable energy. Among the existing methods of hydrogen production, alkaline electrolysis of water is a promising method that can fulfill mankind’s future energy requirements.1,2 However, H2 production by a water splitting reaction during electrolysis suffers from sluggish kinetics especially occurring at the anode (oxygen evolution reaction).3 It is because of this energetically demanding reaction, the technology for hydrogen production by electrolysis of water is highly competitive compared to the existing technology of fossil fuel derived H2 production.4 The anodic water oxidation reaction involves a four electron transfer process which is a kinetically hindered reaction. However, the kinetics of this reaction can be significantly improved using an active water oxidation catalyst.5–9 To date the most efficient catalyst reported is based on ruthenium and iridium metal which are costly and are also present in a limited amount.10–12 Nature does water oxidation, using sunlight via a Mn4O5Ca cluster during the photosystem (II) process in a photosynthesis reaction.13–16 Nature’s choice of water oxidation catalyst Mn4O5Ca consists of a Mn4O4 core with a cubic structure where Mn atoms are bridged by oxygen atoms. Mn is an easily available nontoxic element and exists in a number of oxidation states which are easily accessible.17 State of the art catalysts must be made of cheap and abundant metal atoms, should be efficient so as to catalyze water oxidation reactions at lower overpotentials and must possess a high turnover number.18 Though significant efforts have been made still a large knowledge gap exists that must be bridged to enhance the overall catalytic performance. Among different available catalysts for oxygen evolution, spinels with the AB2O4 †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

View Article Online View Journal | View Issue formula have been shown as potential catalysts that can be used for water oxidation reactions.19–21 Spinels that have a repeating cubical B4O4 core have been reported as active water oxidation catalysts as compared to structures containing a non-cubic core (B3O4 units). The B4O4 core was also reported to be one of the important structural units for the photosystem (II) catalyst that drives water oxidation reactions. The Dismukes group first reported that spinels with a B4O4 core like LiMn2O4 themselves are not active water oxidation catalysts but on delithiation they possess significant catalytic activity.22,23 They reported that on the removal of Li from the LiMn2O4 spinel, its B4O4 core can be activated for the efficient water oxidation reaction. They attributed the enhanced oxygen evolution activity to delithiation leading to increased flexibility in the B4O4 core. Rao et al. studied the spinel like LiCo2O4, having a [Co4O4] cubic unit core.24,25 They concluded that the oxidation state of the metal ion is an important factor to decide the catalytic performance of the spinel based oxides. In another study by the Dismukes group, they reported that in the spinel AB2O4 structure substituting A or B sites can change the water oxidation properties of the resultant spinel.26 The authors also studied the effect of A-site substitution on the water oxidation ability of the LiMn2O4 spinel, where they replaced Li with Mg and Zn. The catalytic performance followed the trend of Zn ∼Mg > Li, which was attributed to the Zn/Mg driven longer Mn–O bonds leading to the flexible cubic core structure. Also, these metal ions result in weaker ligand strength at Mn which contributes to their higher electrocatalytic performance.27 Though some efforts have been made to understand the impact of the lattice structure and the electronic configuration on the oxygen evolution ability of the spinels, still there is a large knowledge gap to further explore these materials for the hydrogen production application. Based on studies carried out by different groups, it was observed that for spinel AB2O4, two important parameters that predict the catalytic performance are the presence of a number of electrons in the eg orbital, and second is the bond length of the oxygen at the B site of the cubic M4O4 core. However, until now studies were mainly based on the study of the effect of substituting a metal cation either at the A or B site in the AB2O4 spinel or removal of the Li-ion from LiMn2O4.28 Since delithiation is the removal of a lithium ion and results in an increase in catalytic performance, no report on the presence of excess lithium for the water oxidation reaction is reported.29 Inspired by recent work in the field of delithiated LiMn2O4 prompted us to study Li-rich Li4Mn5O12 based oxide for water oxidation activity. Li4Mn5O12 is a Li-rich spinel where 1/6th of the Mn of LiMn2O4 is replaced by Li. Li4Mn5O12 has been reported to be a stoichiometric spinel Li[Li0.33Mn1.67]O4 that possesses cubic symmetry.30 In its cubic structure, tetrahedral 8a sites are occupied by lithium ions while in the 16d site, the Mn4+ state is randomly distributed with a Li/Mn ratio of 1 : 5.30,31 It has been studied by various researchers for Li-ion battery applications since the Mn present in Li4Mn5O12 is tetravalent and lacks Jahn–Teller distortion and therefore this material has been looked at as more stable with a long lifetime for use in lithium based rechargeable batteries. No studies have been reported until now for using Li4Mn5O12 in oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis process of Li4Mn5O12 and LiMn2O4 nanostructures using β-MnO2 as a precursor for the water oxidation reaction. In the previous report, we introduced a novel low temperature process for the synthesis of Li4Mn5O12 nanorods using the hydrothermal synthesis of MnO2.32 Herein we further extend our work to synthesise a LiMn2O4 nanorod structure. To understand the role of lithium, the oxidation state of Mn, the presence of excess lithium, and the presence of ionic vs. covalent bonds in the spinel, we examined the water oxidation catalytic properties of the nanostructured LiMn2O4, Li4Mn5O12, and λ-MnO2. The present study demonstrates that the Li4Mn5O12 nanostructure having the Mn4+ state but with lithium in excess outperforms the other two species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever report describing Li-rich spinel Li4Mn5O12 as a potential water splitting catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation 2.1.1 Chemicals and electrodes. Manganese sulfate, sodium hydroxide, ammonium persulfate, nitric acid, tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate, and lithium hydroxide obtained from Spectrochem India were used as such without any further purification. Millipore water was used to prepare the required solutions. 2.1.2 Preparation of γ-MnOOH. γ-MnOOH was synthesized according to the published literature.32 Briefly, 8 mM MnSO4 and 8 mM (NH4)2S2O8 were dissolved separately in distilled water at room temperature and then mixed gradually while maintaining the pH between 9.8 and 10.2 of the solution using a 0.1 M solution of lithium hydroxide monohydrate and 0.1 M H2SO4. This was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 130–135 °C in a muffle furnace for ten hours. The obtained precipitate was cooled down to room temperature, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and afterwards dried in a vacuum oven at 110–115 °C for two hours. 2.1.3 Synthesis of Li4Mn5O12. Li4Mn5O12 was synthesized using a γ-MnOOH precursor by solid state reaction following the procedure reported in our previous work. γ-MnOOH and LiNO3 were mixed together in a 1 : 1 M ratio and then heated at 280 °C for 110 hours in a porcelain crucible. After calcination, the prepared sample was cooled down at room temperature in the presence of air. 2.1.4 Synthesis of LiMn2O4. LiMn2O4 was prepared using γ-MnOOH as a precursor. γ-MnOOH was treated at 300 °C for 3 hours, and the powder so obtained was then mixed with LiOH and then heat treated at 750 °C in the air for 10 hours. 2.1.5 Synthesis of λ-MnO2. To obtain λ-MnO2 an aqueous suspension of LiMn2O4 was added to dilute HNO3 solution while maintaining the solution pH around 2. The suspended solution was left overnight, decanted, washed thoroughly with distilled water and then dried at 80 °C in air.

View Article Online phology of the sample was investigated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM Carl Zeiss ultra plus) and also certified with a Philips CM200 high resolution transmission electron microscope with a LaB6 electron gun at an operating voltage of 200 kV. A high resolution 0.27 nm Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model Smart SORB 92/93 was used to calculate the specific surface area of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted with a K-Alpha+ Thermo-Fisher Scientific X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer. A monochromatic Al Kα source of 1486.6 eV was used and the angle between the sample surface and analyzer axis was kept as 90°. The instrument was calibrated with Ag 3d 352 eV. The powder sample was drop cast on a silicon wafer and mounted on a standard stainless steel plate with conductive carbon tape. The vacuum of the sample loading chamber (load lock chamber) and analyzer chamber was maintained at 1.2 × 10−8 and 2 × 10−9 mbar, respectively. Survey scans were acquired with 400 μm spot size on the sample between the binding energy ranges of 1–1050 eV to confirm the qualitative composition of each sample and to ensure that only the elements expected in each catalyst sample were present. XPS spectra were analyzed with CASA XPS version 2.3.17. For quantification, spectra were the best fit with the Shirley background, after the Gaussian/Lorentzian (G/L) line shape and FWHM contribution. 2.3 Electrode preparation The synthesized catalyst film deposition process involves the mixing of 21 mg of catalyst and 7 mg of acetylene black in 2 mL of neutral Nafion (2 parts of 5% Nafion solution mixed with 1 part of 0.1 M NaOH). The solution was sonicated for 20 min to disperse the particles evenly in the solution and, out of this 3 μL of solution was drop cast on a glassy carbon electrode. The electrode was then dried at 120 °C for 20 min and then used directly for the electrocatalytic reaction. 2.4 Electrochemistry All electrochemical experiments were carried out using a Solatron instrument. A conventional three electrode electrochemical cell was used where the reference electrode was Ag/ AgCl (3 M KCl). Pt wire and a glassy carbon electrode/indium tin oxide electrode (ITO) were used as the counter and working electrodes, respectively. All the experiments were performed at 25 ± 2 °C in the presence of ambient oxygen. In this work the potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) or normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). For RHE conversion in different pH solutions, the following equation was used; E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + E°(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH. In this equation, E(Ag/AgCl) is the observed potential while experiments were performed using a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode. E°(Ag/AgCl) is the potential of Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), i.e., 0.197 V. All experiments were repeated at least thrice to check their reproducibility. The Tafel slope for different catalysts was determined by recording LSV at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The stability of the catalyst was determined using controlled potential electrolysis, by measuring the current density while applying constant potential for a fixed period of time. The charge transfer resistance was measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique with an amplitude of the sinusoidal wave of 10 mV, and the frequency scan range is 100 kHz to 1 Hz. EIS spectra were analyzed using the Bio-Logic EC-Lab software package. To interpret the resistive component, the Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent electric circuit. 3. Results 3.1 Phase structure The different samples so synthesized were characterized using the powder X-ray diffraction method. The PXRD pattern was further analyzed by the Rietveld refinement method as shown in Fig. 1, in which a pseudo-Voigt function was employed for peak profile fitting. The obtained refined lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, discrepancy factors Rp and Rwp and goodness of fit factors of the samples are shown in Table S1.† The XRD pattern of Li4Mn5O12, as shown in Fig. 1(a), can be well indexed to JCPDS file no. 46-0810.33–35 It should be noticed that no impurities corresponding to the presence of Li2MnO3 were found.36 Based on refinement, the lattice parameter was found to be a = 8.13770 Å and the unit cell volume was found to be 538.896 Å3. The obtained values are close to those in the literature.35 The XRD pattern obtained on heating γ-MnOOH with the lithium salt at 750 °C in the air for 10 hours is shown in Fig. 1(b) and can be indexed to JCPDS file no. 35-0782.34,37 It can be observed from the figure that all the characteristic peak positions for LiMn2O4 are shifted to a lower 2θ value compared to pristine Li4Mn5O12 in accordance with the literature report.23 The refined lattice parameter obtained for LiMn2O4 was found to be a = 8.18510 Å with a unit cell volume of 548.367 Å3.38 The Rietveld analysis of the powder XRD patterns confirmed the space group of Fd3ˉm (#227) of the spinel structures. The crystal structure of the spinel samples shows Mn–O bond lengths of 2.099 Å for Li4Mn5O12, 1.938 Å for LiMn2O4 39 and 1.946 Å for λ-MnO2 (Fig. 1e and f).40 To further confirm the formation of Li4Mn5O12 and LiMn2O4, ICP-MS for both the spinels was done. The results are shown in Table S2† and as expected Li4Mn5O12 showed a 1.2 times increase in the Li/Mn ratio compared to LiMn2O4 further confirming the formation of the desired spinel structure. It has been reported in the literature that these oxides often show the presence of XRD peak characteristics along with layered and spinel components.34 However, the synthesis process used in the present work confirms the formation of only the spinel phase. The 2θ value obtained for delithiated λ-MnO2 shows a 3% upshift, which is presented in Fig. 1(c).23 The XRD pattern obtained can be well indexed to JCPDS file no. 440992, corresponding to λ-MnO2, and shows that the spinel structure is retained.23,41 The lattice parameter calculated for the obtained λ-MnO2 was found to be a = 8.0568 Å with a unit cell volume of 522.983 Å3 and the Mn–O bond length was found to be 1.946 Å for λ-MnO2 (Fig. 1g).40 Dalton Transactions Paper This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Dalton Trans., 2022, 51, 12558–12568 | 12561 Published on 21 July 2022.

View Article Online 3.2 Morphology The morphology of Li4Mn5O12 and LiMn2O4 was recorded through scanning electron microscopy and is shown in Fig. S1.† Li4Mn5O12 shows the presence of rod-like structures having a diameter in the range of 16–20 nm. Along with the nanorods, secondary micro-particles can also be observed. The SEM image of LiMn2O4 shows the presence of rod-like structures with diameters in the range of 75–175 nm.42 The increased size of LiMn2O4 nanorods compared to Li4Mn5O12 was due to the relative high temperature experimental conditions used to obtain the former spinel. The HR-TEM image of Li4Mn5O12 (Fig. 2) shows an interplanar spacing of 0.469 nm that can be attributed to the 111 plane while the d-spacing in the LiMn2O4 structure was found to be 0.242 nm which is close to the 311 plane of the spinel structure. The morphology of λ-MnO2 was found to be very close to LiMn2O4 having a d-spacing value of 0.464 nm corresponding to the 111 plane. 3.3 Surface composition XPS was further recorded for different samples to determine the oxidation state and valence of the Mn present in different spinels. As can be seen from Fig. 3 all Mn 2p XPS spectra consist of two peaks, which can be attributed to the spin orbit splitting level of Mn, that is, Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2. For Li4Mn5O12, the binding energies at 654.08 and 642.2 eV correspond to Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2.34 The difference between the spin energies of 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 was found to be 11.8 eV which is in close agreement with the reported literature value.35 Furthermore, the 2p3/2 spectral fitting supports the presence of Mn in +4 and +3 oxidation states with a major contribution of Mn in the +4 state. For Li4Mn5O12, surface oxygen analysis shows two types of peaks for the lattice oxygen, and oxygen observed in the surface vacancies. In our results the peak at a lower binding energy of 528.6 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen. The peak at a higher binding energy of 532.2 eV is attributed to fewer electron-rich oxygen species which are further deconvoluted into three components. Thus, XPS results of the O 1s core level are fitted by four components (Table S5† and in Fig. 3) and are ascribed to the adsorbed oxygen (O2 2−/O−at 529.16), hydroxide species (OH−at 531.09), molecular water (H2O at 533.35) adsorbed on the surface and lattice oxygen (O2 −at 528.6 eV).27,43 Li4Mn5O12, as compared to the other two spinels, shows more adsorbed oxygen species suggesting the presence of more surface oxygen vacancy.44 In the case of LiMn2O4 the deconvoluted Mn 2p3/2 spectra show the contribution due to Mn3+ (49.76%) and Mn4+ (50.24%) as shown in Table S3.† This is expected for the LiMn2O4 spinel and has also been reported in the literature.41 It is well documented in the literature that the FWHM (full width at half maximum) larger than 3.5 eV indicates the presence of Mn4+ along with Mn3+.45 The FWHM of the Mn 2p3/2 peak is more than Li4Mn5O12 further confirming the presence of Mn in the +3 state. On delithiation λ-MnO2 is formed which again showed the contribution from Mn3+ along Mn4+, however, as determined by XPS, the average oxidation state of Mn was found to be 3.8 which is intermediate to the other two Fig. 2 HR-TEM images of (a) Li4Mn5O12, (b) LiMn2O4, and (c) λ-MnO2 at a size of 100 nm.

The linear scan voltammogram recorded shows that the best performance was obtained for Li4Mn5O12. The onset potential for the oxygen evolution reaction was found to be 0.36 V whereas a current density of 5 mA cm−2 was found to be achieved at 0.439 V while LiMn2O4 could not achieve this current density under a similar potential window. LiMn2O4 on delithiation demonstrates better catalytic performance. The controlled potential electrolysis curves were recorded for 12 hours at an η of 0.33 V, which shows good stability over a period of time. Fig. 4(d) shows the current density obtained for different samples, normalized with respect to the amount of material deposited, and the value was used to calculate the TOF. Li4Mn5O12 has ∼4 times higher TOF than λ-MnO2, as shown in Table 1. The TOFs of different Mn based spinels having structural similarity with the present studied compounds are summarized in Table S7† which shows the good performance of Li4Mn5O12. Furthermore, the current obtained due to the water oxidation reaction was further confirmed by recording LSV under similar experimental conditions in 0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile solvent. No current was observed in a non-aqueous solvent confirming the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode with water as a substrate. The Tafel slope is another important parameter that is used as a defining value for comparison of the catalytic performance as shown in Fig. 4(e). The Tafel constant reported for three spinels showed a trend that is in agreement with the linear scan voltammogram. A minimum Tafel slope was observed for Li4Mn5O12 Fig. 3 XPS Mn 2p spectra of (a) Li4Mn5O12, (b) LiMn2O4, and (c) λ-MnO2. O 1s core-level spectra of (d) Li4Mn5O12, (e) LiMn2O4, and (f) λ-MnO2.

It is a known fact that the Tafel slope is inversely proportional to the charge transfer coefficient,48,49 and therefore the catalyst with a minimum charge transfer coefficient is expected to have a fast charge transfer process across the electrocatalytic interface. To further understand this, electrochemical impedance was Fig. 4 (a) LSV curve with IR correction, (b) LSV curve with a mass normalized catalyst loading, (c) CPE graph of Li4Mn5O12 recorded for 12 hours at an applied overpotential of 0.33 mV in 1 M NaOH solution, (d) CPE graph of Li4Mn5O12 with a mass normalized catalyst loading recorded for 12 hours, (e) Tafel plot, and (f) BET fitting curves for Li4Mn5O12 ( ), LiMn2O4 ( ), and λ-MnO2 ( ).

The Nyquist plot recorded for the different samples at an applied potential of 0.8 V is shown in Fig. S3.† The equivalent components were obtained by fitting the data using a circuit model shown in Fig. S3(d),† where the circuit component Rs is the electrolyte resistance, CPE1 and CPE2 are the constant phase elements, R1 is the internal resistance of the solid electrolyte interface and R2 is the charge transfer resistance. Li4Mn5O12 shows a charge transfer resistance of 29.36 Ω followed by delithiated MnO2, and it is maximum for LiMn2O4. These numbers further suggest faster reaction kinetics at the lithium rich spinel Li4Mn5O12 compared to the LiMn2O4 spinel. To further understand this trend, the surface area of the different materials was analyzed using BET as shown in Fig. 4(f). As can be seen from Table 1 Li4Mn5O12 shows a higher surface area, which is expected owing to the fact that Li4Mn5O12 was synthesized at a lower temperature compared to the other two materials. It is interesting that though delithiated λ-MnO2 has a lower surface area compared to LiMn2O4 but still the former outperforms in terms of water oxidation activity. Also though λ-MnO2 has a lower surface area it also has lower charge transfer resistance compared to LiMn2O4. This shows that for spinel based catalysts, structural flexibility is an important factor that decides the oxygen evolution reaction ability of the catalytic center as has been reported by the Dismukes group. 23LiMn2O4 reported in the literature for water oxidation application has been shown to have very negligible electrocatalytic activity. On substitution of A & B sites, different spinels were developed that showed improved performance. However, while LiMn2O4 nanorods have been used for battery applications, to the best of our knowledge this is the first ever report where nanorods of LiMn2O4 have been explored for water oxidation activity. Also can be seen from Table 1 that the LiMn2O4 nanorods obtained have been found to show improved activity compared to the literature report.50 This may be attributed to the nanorod like structure. It is a well-known fact that the morphology and particle size are important attributes of the performance of water oxidation catalysts. On delithiation, λ-MnO2 formed shows improved performance compared to the pristine LiMn2O4, an observation in accordance with the literature report on increased flexibility in the cubical Mn4O4 core on the removal of Li+.50 The interesting finding of the present work is the higher electrocatalytic performance of the Li-rich spinel Li4Mn5O12. The factor that may be contributing to the enhanced performance of Li4Mn5O12 is (1) higher surface area, (2) improved electrical conductivity and (3) increased degree of ionic bonding in Li4Mn5O12. To further investigate the structural and chemical changes in the most active catalyst that is Li4Mn5O12, XPS and TEM were also recorded before and after the stability test as shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f), respectively. The average oxidation state of Mn after the test is summarized in Table S4.† After 12 hours of the CPE test the Mn species remained largely in their original chemical state, and as can be seen from Fig. 5e, the intensity of the Mn4+ 2p3/2 peak is much stronger than that of the Mn3+ 2p3/2 peak.51 To further study the effect of the lithium ion, the Li 1s spectrum was also recorded after the stability test for 12 hours Fig. 5(g). The Li 1s spectral position was found to be very close to Mn 3p spectra and in the range of 44–57 eV where Li 1s spectra are at 54.3 eV and are in good agreement with the literature.52,53 After 12 hours of the cycle the peak of Li 1s shifted to a lower binding energy of 53.8 eV. The shifting of the binding energy of the Li can be attributed to the migration of the Li+ ions as has been reported by the Byeong-Gyu group.54 We believe that the binding energy of Li 1s becomes lowered due to the migration of Li+ ions towards the surface. Since the spectra were not of very good quality it was difficult to quantify them and therefore Li 1s was quantified with the Mn 3p position peak as shown in Fig. 5(g) and (h). As can be seen that relative to Mn ions, the Li ion ratio was found to decrease quantitatively after the stability test further supporting our hypothesis of the involvement of Li ions in the water oxidation reaction by Li4Mn5O12. Li4Mn5O12 was further investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) after the 12 hours of OER measurements Fig. 5(a–d). Well-crystalline surface structures can be observed for the as-synthesized sample, however, a 5 nm image of the Li4Mn5O12 sample after 12 hours of the stability test shows an amorphous region in contrast to the largely crystalline surface of the as-prepared catalyst.43,55 As has been observed Li4Mn5O12 has a higher surface area compared to the other two, and therefore, the increased activity can be because of the presence of more electrochemically active sites. A higher surface area of Li4Mn5O12 results in enhanced access of electrolytes to the catalytic center, thus contributing to increased catalytic current.44 This will further decrease the charge transfer resistance at electrodes which is further confirmed by impedance measurement. However, it should be noted that a higher surface area cannot be the only deciding factor for higher electrocatalytic performance, because if that would be, then it was expected for λ-MnO2 to perform worst in all three. As has been reported Mn based spinels having cubic cores are relatively electrochemically more active as water oxidation catalysts as compared to their corresponding layered polymorphs which possess non-cubical cores, this is due to the presence of the average longer and, therefore, weaker M–O bonds of the core. It has been proposed by the Dismukes group that the presence of longer M–O bonds in spinels with a cubic core results in a greater charge density leading to increased repulsion within the core thereby contributing to providing a relatively lower energy barrier for proTable 1 Performance comparison based on the overpotential, Tafel slope, TOF, Rct and BET values of λ-MnO2, LiMn2O4, and Li4Mn5O12 Parameters Overpotential at 5 mA cm−2 (mV) Tafel slope (mV dec−1) TOF (s−1) Rct (Ohm) BET specific surface area (m2 g−1) LiMn2O4 484 89 0.1 × 10−4 75.31 5.81 λ-MnO2 451 78 3.03 × 10−4 58.85 1.33 Li4Mn5O12 439 74 12.1 × 10−4 29.36 24.46 Dalton Transactions Paper This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Dalton Trans., 2022, 51, 12558–12568 | 12565 Published on 21 July 2022.

In the present studies, the Rietveld refinement of the synthesized spinels reveals (Fig. 1e–g and Table S1†) that among LiMn2O4 and Li4Mn5O12, the latter has a longer Mn–O bond compared to the former one. The higher electrocatalytic activity of Li4Mn5O12 can also be due to the presence of longer and weaker Mn–O bonds, yielding greater core flexibility to release O2 during the water oxidation reaction.56,57 During the delithiation, the A-site Li+ of LiMn2O4 is completely removed from the spinel framework and creates vacancies.

View Article Online To maintain the electroneutrality, the B-site rearranges and becomes more flexible and enhances the catalytic activity of the restructured spinel λ-MnO2.27 Enhanced water oxidation in λ-MnO2 is due to the cubical subunit Mn4O4 which is analogous to the CaMn4O4 subunit of PSII. This has also been observed before. Therefore, similar trends show that Li4Mn5O12 along with the surface area, increased ionic bonding, and repeating cubical B4O4 cores with the presence of longer and weaker Mn–O bonds are important factors that lead to the higher catalytic performance of Li4Mn5O12. In Li based spinels, Li–O bonds are ionic while Mn3d/O2p bonds have a significant contribution to covalent bonding. For Li4Mn5O12, 1/6th of the Mn ions is replaced by Li ions compared to the classical LiMn2O4 spinel. On replacement of 1/6th of the Mn ions with Li-ions, the degree of covalent bonding decreases with a simultaneous increase in the contribution from ionic bonding. Also upon introduction of excess lithium ions in the spinel, three dimensional Li-diffusion channels are formed which may be contributing to improving the reaction kinetics at the electrode as has also been reported in the literature33 and also supported by the impedance studies carried out in the present studies. The involvement of Li ions was further confirmed by XPS. Li4Mn5O12 nanostructures have been shown for the first time as efficient water oxidation catalysts compared to LiMn2O4 and λ-MnO2. It is a known fact that in Li4Mn5O12 which is also presented as Li(Mn5/3Li1/3)O4 is considered a chemically perfect ordered spinel where 1/6th of the Mn ions are perfectly replaced with lithium ions and form a compound with long range ordering. However, this Li4Mn5O12 synthesis in the present studies is perfornmed at a very low temperature of 280 °C (until now all Li4Mn5O12 has been synthesized at a temperature of 400 °C–700 °C, with a maximum of around 700 °C by a solid state reaction). Because of this low temperature, it may be possible that the end product, Li4Mn5O12 is not perfectly chemically ordered where Li may be occupying a random position of Mn as well as Mn may be occupying the tetrahedral sites of Li or thereby overall leading to an increase in local ionic disorder. It has been a well-known fact that Li–O–Mn and Li–O–Li geometries play a very important role in determining the internal charge transfer rates including O1−→O2−and Mn3+ →Mn4+ transitions, leading to facilitated oxygen evolution reaction.35 We believe that along with the nanostructure morphology with an enhanced surface area, increased percentage of ionic bonding and the presence of three dimension channels, the low temperature synthesis process may also have played an important role in achieving significant activity. 4. Conclusions In summary, LiMn2O4, Li4Mn5O12, and λ-MnO2 nanostructures are prepared by a low temperature synthesis process. The XRD result and ICPMS result confirm the pure spinel phase formation of these materials. While transition metal ions containing the LiMn2O4 spinel (where Mn/Li is replaced with transition metal ions) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction, this is the first report where lithium rich Li4Mn5O12 has been found to show enhanced catalytic performance compared to LiMn2O4 and λ-MnO2. Also, it shows good stability under experimental conditions. High surface area, presence of 3D Li diffusion channels, increased percentage of ionic bonding, and low temperature derived Li4Mn5O12 with chemical disordering may be the possible reason for better performance of the Li4Mn5O12 structure. The above results show that Li-rich spinel Li4Mn5O12 is a potential material for oxygen evolution reactions and therefore will be attractive for further research.

In calculating lithium concentration from electrochemical measurements, it is generally assumed that all current passed through the cell can be related to the lithium extractionrinsertion process. The amount of lithium in the structure can also be refined from neutron powder diffraction data, and it is common that results from the two methods differ. For Ž example, the structure at the highest potential ca. . 4.5 V is generally referred to as the l-MnO phase 2 w x4 and is assumed to be a lithium-free phase, while ex situ neutron diffraction shows that ca. 25% of the w x lithium remains in the structure 5 . This raises the question of the relationship between observed structure and electrochemical performance.

The electrochemical cell The cell used was a modified version of that w x Ž . developed by Bergstrom et al. 9 Fig. 2 . A Pyrexq ̈ tube was lined with Li foil and sealed at each end with brass plugs. The lithium foil was then covered Ž with a Celgardq separator. A cathode mixture ;5 .

The electrolyte was a 1 M solution of LiBF in 2:1 EC:DMC. Cells were assembled in a 4 Ž glove box under a dry argon atmosphere -2 ppm . H OrO . 2 2 2.2. In situ neutron diffraction The cell was sealed and charged at a constant Ž . current 1.0 mA to the desired potentials. This corresponds to the very slow charge rate of ca. Ž Cr750. The potentials used were: 3.60 ‘as pre. pared’ , 4.00, 4.05, 4.10, 4.12, 4.16, and 4.24 V vs. LirLiq. Neutron diffraction data were collected at each potential at the steady-state medium-flux research reactor R2 in Studsvik, Sweden. A monochroŽ mator system with two copper crystals 220-reflec̊ .

Structural refinement Refinements of the Li Mn O data sets were x 2 4 based on the Rietveld method using the program w x FULLPROF 10,11 . The neutron scattering lengths used were Li: y1.90, Mn: y3.73 and O: 5.803 fm. The diffraction peaks were described by a pseudo-Voigt function; a Lorentzian contribution to the Gaussian peak shape was also refined. Peak asymmetry corrections were made for angles below 458 in 2u. Background intensities were described by a linear interpoFig. 2. A schematic representation of the cell used for in situ Ž .

Peaks arising from the stainlees-steel current collector are marked with Ž). an asterisk . lation between ca. 40 assumed background points. A lattice parameter and an atomic positional parameter for oxygen were refined together with a scale-factor and a 2u zero-point parameter. The lithium content was also refined for the delithiated samples. Since occupancies and displacement parameters are correlated, the latter were fixed to the values obtained at Ž . 3.60 V ‘as prepared’ . The stainless-steel current collector also gave rise to diffraction peaks. These have been refined as two Fe phases, with strongly preferred orientations in the Ž . Ž . 100 and 110 directions, respectively. This was done in the refinements of the ‘as prepared’ data and then kept fixed in all subsequent refinements; only the scale factor for this contribution was included. 3. Results and discussion The LiMn O starting material was a single-phase 2 4 ̊ Ž . powder with a lattice parameter of 8.221 1 A, rew x fined from neutron diffraction data 5 . Fig. 3 shows the diffraction profile from the cell in its uncharged Ž state. Although the background is high mainly incoherent scattering from the hydrogenous components . in the electrolyte , the reflections are still well resolved. Data at the selected potentials have been refined, and the resulting parameters are summarised in Table 1. It is clear that the Mn–O framework remains intact during delithiation, and no additional peaks are observed. Lithium was found only at the 8a site, the same site as in the LiMn O start 2 4 material. The variation in the refined lattice parameter and lithium content in Li Mn O is plotted in x 2 4 Fig. 4. The lattice parameter is almost constant at potentials below 4.0 V, and falls rapidly between 4.0 and 4.1 V. There is anomalous behaviour in the lattice parameter at 4.16 V; it could be an experimental mishap for which we can find no explanation, or that some form of SEI layer starts to form at this potential. A more plausible explanation, however, could be that the abrupt upward shift in cell parameter is merely an artifact of an unresolved two-phase Table 1 A summary of the refinement of in situ neutron diffraction data for Li Mn O x 2 4 q Potential, V, vs. LirLi Uncharged 4.00 4.05 4.10 4.12 4.16 4.24 Ž .

It is also clear that the delithiation process begins at potentials above 4.0 V vs. LirLiq. From ex situ neutron diffraction studies, we know that the Ž . w x lithium content in the l-MnO phase is 0.28 5 5 ; 2 this is reconfirmed by this present study. On the other hand, the lithium content for the ‘single-phase’ at ca. 4.10 V differs from earlier proposed composiw x tions 7,12 , where it was interpreted as a Li Mn O 0.5 2 4 phase, assuming that all current passed through the cell could be attributed to lithium extraction. However, the composition is strongly dependent on the voltage. The single-phase region is found between Ž . 4.05 and 4.14 V Fig. 5 , and the lithium content in the 8a sites decreases from 0.65 to 0.50 in this region. w x w x Both in situ Raman 13 and in situ XRD 7,8 measurements have shown that Li Mn O passes x 2 4 through a two-phase region on its way to becoming the single-phase l-MnO . This two-phase region is 2 found in the 0.5-x-0.13 range according to Ref. w x w x 14 , and 0.45-x-0.20 according to Ref. 8 . These x-values are calculated on the basis of current passed, assuming that the x-value decreases uniformly during the charge process. In the present study, no two-phase behaviour was detectable in the high potential region. This can be a result of the very slow w x charging rate used 7 . XPS studies have shown that some type of solid layer is formed on the surface of the cathode partiŽ . Fig. 4.

A possible explanation for the discrepancies in the results is then that some of the charge passed is consumed during the formation of such a layer. 3.1. A final comment The lithium content in Li Mn O has, thus, been x 2 4 Ž . followed for the first time by in situ neutron diffraction as a function of cell potential. The method used is simple and the lithium content obtained from these refinements is in agreement with that refined earlier from ex situ neutron diffraction measurements w x5 . Compared to ex situ studies, the in situ method has the advantage of using only one cell, but the large amount of active material involved means that much longer equilibration times are needed.

BLASSE Philips Research Laboratories, N. V. Philips’ Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven, Netherlands (Received 5 August 1965) Abstract-The magnetic properties of a number of oxygen spinels contaning Mn4+ are reported. Some of these compounds appear to be ferromagnetic (e.g. CuMgs.sMnr.sO4 and LiZns.sMnr.s04), whereas others show a ferrimagnetic behaviour due to crystallographic order of paramagnetic ions on octahedral sites (e.g. LiNis.sMnr.sO4 and ZnNiMnO4). The combination of tetrahedral Cu+ and octahedral Mn4+ is shown to be more stable than tetrahedral Cus+ and octahedral Mns+. It is concluded that the 90” MnJ+-Os--Mn4+ interaction is ferromagnetic and the 90” Nis+-Os--Mn4+ interaction antiferromagnetic. INTRODUCTION A NUMBER of oxygen spinels containing Mn4+ ions have been reported earlier by us.(l) Their magnetic properties were dealt with in two preliminary short papers.(sJ) It was found that some of these compounds are ferromagnetic, whereas others are ferrimagnetic, although the tetrahedral sites in these compounds are occupied by diamagnetic ions. It is the aim of the present paper to give a more extensive discussion of these results. Simultaneously the problem of the charge distribution of Cu and Mn ions in oxygen spinels was solved. The charge distribution of CuMnaOe for example, was written by Sinha et al. as Cu+[Mns+Mn4+]04,(4) whereas Baltzer et al. proposed Cua+[Mn>]04.@) EXPERIMENTAL The experimental procedures were the same as those described earlier.(r) RESULTS Table 1 presents the cell edge, cation distribution, chemical analysis and the magnetic properties of the compounds studied. Figures l-5 show some of the experimental results obtained (o-T, o-H and x-1-T curves).

DISCUSSION 1. Ferromagnetic compounds The compound AND FERRIMAGNETISM OF OXYGEN SPINELS 385 and 77°K and The compound CuMge.sMnl.504 presents a more complicated case. It was already mentioned in the introduction that in the literature two possible charge distributions have been proposed LiZna.~Mnr.~O4(Lia.gZna.5[Lia.~Mn1.5]04) is a very peculiar spinel. Not only its crystallographic order is remarkable (1 :l order on A-sites and simultaneously 1:3 order on B-sites,(l) but also its magnetic order is uncommon for a spinel, viz. ferromagnetic. This follows unambiguously from the shape of the x-1-T curve (Fig. 1) and the value of the saturation moment at 4*2”K and has been proved in the meantime by neutron diffraction . (6) X@ t FIG. 2.

Let us summarize the arguments. A compound with distribution (A) is expected to be ferromagnetic due to the presence of Mn4+ ions as the only kind of paramagnetic ions on B-sites (compare LiZno.sMnr.sO4). A compound with distribution (B) is expected to be ferrimagnetic. Up to about 650% CuMgs.5Mn1.504 behaves as is to be expected for the distribution Cuf[Mgs.sM&]04: the value of the saturation moment at 4.2°K and the shape and slope of the x-l-2’ curve present ample evidence for this statement. At higher temperatures the x-1-T curve becomes convex, which points to the formation of CL+ and Mnsf. In this way it is also possible to explain the dependence of the magnetic properties on heat treatment and the somewhat too low value of the magnetic moment (Table 2). If the energy difference between distributions (4) and (23) is small, copper is present as Cuf and Cus+ and manganese as Mns+ and Mn4+ at the reaction temperature (900-1000°K). For such a complicated system of ions we can hardly expect to reach the ideal cation distribution with Cu exclusively on A-sites at the reaction temperature. The deviation from the distribution Cu[Mgs.sMnr.slO* will be larger if the reaction temperature is h:gher and the cooling rate more rapid. If the distribution is not exactly Cu+[Mgs.sMn~~s]04, Cu and Mn ions may partly change sites.t The result of this is that locally the t In this connection it is interesting to note that careful X-ray examinations of CuMnzO4 have shown that a considerable amount of the Mn ions occupy A-sites.c7) ferromagnetic order of Mn4+ ions on B-sites is disturbed by Mns+ ions on A-sites and Cus+ on B-sites. It seems highly improbable that the combination M&i+ on A-sites and Cu+ on B-sites would be more stable than Mns+ and Cus+ because of the electron configurations (Mn4+ : d3 and Cu+ : SO) and the large radius of the Cu+ ion (about 1 A). Consequently Mnsf-Mn4+ ABinteractions and Cuaf-M&f BB-interactions are present. The former is probably negative, the latter is negative (see below). All this is deduced from the following experimental results. The more rapid the cooling rate, the higher the Curie constant (more Cu2+ and Mnsl-), the lower the asymptotic Curie constant (less positive Mn4~-Mn4~ BB-interactions and more negative interactions), the lower the Curie temperature (compare Fig. 2) and the lower the magnetic moment (antiferromagnetic arrangements). Probably the value of da/dH at 4~2°K at high fields points also into this direction. The arguments given above are also valid in the case of the third ferromagnetic compound CuRhMnO4, which, therefore, is not discussed any further. From these results it is concluded that the 90” Mn4+-Mn4+ interaction in these spinels is positive. The sign of this interaction must be due to the orthogonality of e.g. the dzy orbitals of neighbouring Mn4+ ions (compare@)). The direct overlap of these orbitals is obviously not large enough to overcome this effect. This is the case for the 90” Crsf-Crsf interaction in oxides, which is strongly negative. This direct overlap is strongly dependent on distance, as has been argued by FERROMAGNETISM AND FERRIMAGNETISM OF OXYGEN SPINELS 387 GooDENoUGm@) One should expect therefore, that the 90” Mn4+-Mn4+ interaction also depends on distance. Increasing distance means decreasing direct overlap and consequently a stronger positive exchange. This agrees with the experimental results. In LiZe.sMnr.504 and CuMga.5Mnr.504 the only paramagnetic ions present (Mn4+) occupy the same crystallographic sites. The cell edge of the latter compound is larger and its Curie temperature higher (Table 1). The effect may even be strengthened by the large size of the Cu+ ion. A large cation on A-sites implies a large u-parameter, so that the Mn4+-Oa--Mn4+ angle becomes larger than 90”. This implies a smaller direct overlap. In one of our earlier papers(a) this interaction was concluded to be very weakly negative as had also been found, by Bongers in I~i~MnOs~(l~) This was inferred from susceptibility measurements at high temperatures and may be due to the Mna+-contents of these samples, which was somewhat larger than that of the present samples. At the moment the possibility of negative 90” Mn4+-Mn4+ interaction in oxides cannot be excluded due to the distanceand angle-dependence of this interaction. However, up till now it has not been found in stoichiometric samples. 2. Ferrimgnetic compounds The compound LiNi~.sMn~.~O4 shows a new type of magnetic order in the spine1 structure. The ferrimagnetic behaviour of spinels (for example the well-known ferrites) has been explained by N&e1 by assuming an antiparallel and collinear arrangement of the Aand B-sublattice magnetizations: &&]04,Gl) In LiNie.sMnl.504 the A-sites are occupied exclusively by diamagnetic Li+ ions. The B-sites are occupied by Nie+ and Mn4+ ions in an ordered arrangement as in lithium ferrite, Fe[Lie.sFel.s]04. The magnetic behaviour (Table 1, Fig. 3) of LiNis.sMnl.sO4 can easily be explained by assuming an antiparallel and collinear arrangement of Nis+ and Mn4f ions: Li[5Z2’ ,.51%i~~5]04. Its x-1-T curve is hyperbolic as is to be expected for a ferrimagnetic compound and its saturation moment equal to the difference of the postulated sublattices. This phenomenon has been observed earlier by SWOBODA et ah(12) in the corundum structure, CoMnOa and NiMnOa have ilmenite structure (i.e. ordered corundum) and are ferrimagnetic: sa+&4+Os and I$+i%n4+Oa. From our results on LiNis.sMnl.sO4 it is clear that the 90” Nisi-Mn4f interaction is negative. An important contribution to this interaction will be due to the non-orthogonality of e.g. the dzx-p orbital of the Nia+ ion and the dzy orbital of the Mn4+ ion. It is interesting to note that the Nis+-Mn4+ interaction in oxides is one of the few interactions, for which something is known about the dependence on the angle NP-Os--Mn4+. In the perovskite LasNPMn4fOa (angle Nis+-Oa--Mn4+ about 180”) the NW-Mn 4+ interaction is (relatively~ strongly positive,(ls) in the ilmenite Nia+Mn*+Oa (angle Nis+-Oa--Mn4+ about 135”) it is negativeGab as it is in the spine1 LiNi~fSMn~~504 (angle Nis+-Oa--Mn4+ 90”). Returning to LiNi*.~Mn~.~O* it is noted that the sublattice interaction within the Mn4+-sublattice is positive (compare LiZn*.5Mn~.~O4~, whereas the interaction between NW ions mutually will be very weak, since in this ordered structure no Niaf pairs occur (every NW ion is surrounded by six Mn4f ions). The antiferromagnetic alignment of the Nis+ and Mn4+ sublattice is therefore not disturbed by interactions within the sublattice. The other ferrimagnetic compounds can now be mentioned briefly. CuNi~.~Mn~.~O* is analogous 9 . *a’ to LiNia.~Mnl.s04, viz. CU+[N~,.~ ii?;;:lb)O4. The x-1-T curve (Fig. 4) becomes convex at higher temperatures, which can be ascribed to the same phenomenon as in the case of CuMga.sMnl.504 (formation of Cust and Mns+). The cell edge of the Cu compound is larger than that of the Li compound, so that the Mn4+-Mn4+ interaction is expected to be stronger positive as is reflected by the less negative asymptotic Curie temperature (-20 vs. 60°K). For CuNio.sMnt.sO4 we observed a similar dependence of heat treatment on the magnetic properties as in the case of CuMgs.sMn~.s04, which is ascribed to the same fact. Cul.5Mnl.504 is analogous to CuNia.sMnr.504: Cu+[6$$$JO4, so that the 90” Cus-t-Mn4+ interaction proves to be also negative. Finally ZnNiMnO4 is mentioned. This compound was prepared for the first time by 388 G. BLASSE BONGERS, (10) who deduced from paramagnetic susceptibility measurements the charge and cation distribution Zn[Nia+Mn4+]04. He found a hyperbolic x-1-T curve and a saturation moment at 77°K. Recently French investigators have reported 1 :l order between divalent and tetravalent ions on the octahedral spine1 sublattice, viz. in the case of Zn[ZnTi]04(14) and Mn[MnTi]O.t.(ls) In view of these results it seems probable that the spine1 ZnNiMnO4 shows at least short-range or even long-range 1 :l order between Nia+ and Mn4+ ions. Due to the small difference between the scattering power of these ions the absence of superstructure reflections in the X-ray diagram does not necessarily mean that there is no order. If there is order, then ZnNiMn04 is expected to be c-a ferrimagnet of the type Zn[Nia+Mn4+]04, especially because the Mn4+-Mn4+ interaction will be positive and the Nia+-Nia+ interaction is very weak. The experimental results can be explained in this way. The x-1-T curve has a hyperbolic shape characteristic of a ferrimagnetic compound. The saturation moment at 4*2”K amounts to 0.87 pn, which is about equal to the difference between the magnetic moments of the Nis+ and Mn4+ ion. 3. Other compounds The results of the measurements on the other compounds cannot be explained so easily. LiMnaO4 remains paramagnetic down to 4~2°K with a large asymptotic Curie temperature (0, = -260°K). One would expect a crystallographic order between the Mns+ and Mn4+ ions on B-sites (distribution Li[NIns+Mn4+]04) like in magnetite, Fes+[Fea+Fea+]O4(17), which should be reflected in the magnetic properties, but there is no indication of such a transition. This is perhaps due to clustering of Mns+ ions.(l*,la) The situation in CuCrMn04 is a little more clear (Fig. 5). The x-1-T curve is convex. In the region 300-500°K it approaches a straight line with a slope calculated for Cu+Crs+Mn4+04 (see Fig. 5); above 500°K it becomes more convex, due to the formation of Cua+ and Mns+ and below 300°K it is more or less hyperbolic. Below 45°K the compound shows a saturation moment, but saturation is not obtained in fields up to 30 kOe (Fig. 9, which probably indicates noncollinear spin arrangements.@s) At low temperatures the cation distribution will be approximately Cu+[Cra+Mn4+]04, but long-range magnetic order on B-sites is not easy to achieve, because there is no crystallographic order. Moreover, the Crs+-Crs+ interaction is known to be strongly negative.(a) In this connection something may be said about CuMns04. We could not obtain pure samples of this compound. The same was reported by BONCERS(~@ and RIEN~~CKER and WERNER. From the foregoing results there seems to be no doubt that the original idea of SINHA et d.(4) is correct and that the charge distribution is Cu+[Mna+Mn4+]04. However, if the samples are cooled too rapidly, part of the Mn ions remain on A-sites, so that the distribution is then Cu~_,Mn~[Cu$+Mns+Mn~~z]04 (compare the discussion of CuMga.sMnl.sO4). We could not prepare LiMgs.5Mnr.504 and LiCoe.5Mn1.s04 with the correct oxygen contents (Table 1). The experimental values are somewhat too low. This implies that there is a certain amount of Mna+ ions present. From Table 1 it is seen that LiMgs.sMn1.504 does not behave like LiZns.sMnl.504, nor LiCos.sMn1.504 as LiNia.5Mn1.504. Especially the fact that the samples could not be saturated in fields up to 30 kOe is noteworthy. This may be due to the presence of trivalent manganese. We expect that stoichiometric LiMgo.sMn1.504 is ferromagnetic and stoichiometric LiCoa.5Mn1.504 ferrimagnetic. Finally it is noted that the Cu+ ion seems only to be stable in oxygen spinels, if Mn4+ is simultaneously present. Compare for example the compositions CuRhMnO4 and CuRhTiOa. The first is a spinel, the second is not. Acknowledgements-The author would like to express his sincere thanks to Miss G. E. C. M.

Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction Study of the Spinel-type LiMn2O4 Junji Akimoto,* Yasuhiko Takahashi, Yoshito Gotoh, and Susumu Mizuta National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research,1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, 305-8565, Japan Received May 3, 2000 Revised Manuscript Received August 21, 2000 Lithium manganese oxide, LiMn2O4, is an attractive cathode material for lithium ion rechargeable batteries owing to its cost and environmental performance.1 Recently, much attention has been paid to the structural and physical properties of this compound, investigated by various techniques such as NMR,2 XAFS,3,4 magnetism,5,6 and diffraction techniques.7-10 The stoichiometric compound LiMn2O4 presents a first-order structural transition around room temperature. Above the transition temperature it has the cubic spinel structure with Fd3hm space group.11 The crystal structure of the low temperature form has been investigated at 280, 230, and 100 K using the neutron and synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction method. Rousse and coworkers12-14 and Massarotti et al.15 reported an orthorhombic ∼3a × 3a × a superstructure of the basic cubic spinel structure, while Wills et al. refined using a tetragonal ∼2a ×2a × a superstructure model.6 To clarify the true crystal symmetry, precise crystal structure, the mechanism of the structural transition, and physical properties of LiMn2O4, sizable, wellcharacterized single crystal specimens have highly been desired, as in the study of Fe3O4 magnetite,16 though corresponding single crystals with good quality have not yet been synthesized. In the present study, we report the single crystal synthesis and the X-ray structure refinement of the first single crystal of the spinel-type LiMn2O4. We will also demonstrate the structural phase transition around room temperature by single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. Starting materials for the crystal growth were the asprepared LiMn2O4 powder (Cell Seed M, Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan) and lithium chloride powder (99.9%). These materials were wellmixed in the nominal weight ratio of LiMn2O4:LiCl ) 1:8, sealed in a gold tube, heated at 1173 K for 10 days, and gradually cooled to 297 K at a rate of 5 K/h. The produced single crystals were easily separated from the frozen flux materials by rinsing the gold tube in water for several minutes. Black, octahedral-shape single crystals of about 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm3 in maximum were obtained, as shown in Figure 1. SEM-EDX analysis showed that the crystals were free from gold contamination from the tube. The chemical formula, analyzed by inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) using the pulverized crystals, confirmed the stoichiometric chemical composition; the result was consistent with that of the present structure refinement. X-ray precession photographs taken at 298 K using Mo KR radiation indicate that the crystals belong to the cubic spinel structure with Fd3hm space group. The spinel structure was carefully investigated at 297 K by single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. The intensity data were collected by the 2θ-ω scan mode with a scan rate of 1°/min at 297 K on a four-circle diffractometer (Rigaku AFC-7R, operating conditions: 50 kV, 180 mA) using graphite-monochromatized Mo KR radiation (λ ) 0.710 73 Å). A summary of the crystallographic and experimental data is given in Table 1. All calculations were carried out using the XTAL3.4 program.17 The refined lattice parameter and the oxygen parameter x are in good agreement with the previous results for the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 using neutron powder dif* Corresponding author.

Temperature dependence of the structure between 230 and 330 K was precisely investigated on the fourcircle diffractometer using a nitrogen gas flow cryostat. The temperature was stable to 0.5 K. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were measured after equilibrium of the crystal specimen for 30 min at a given temperature. The structural phase transition at about 285 K on the cooling process has been confirmed by the temperature dependence of peak profiles of the main Bragg reflections. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction space mapping provides a means of directly observing distortions such as lattice tilting and twinning present in the reciprocal lattice. The value of the lattice parameters directly relates to the peak separation along the 2θ axis, whereas any macroscopic tiltings will show as a difference along the ω axis. We first measured the mapping at 230 K on the four-circle diffractometer and then at 330 K around the same reciprocal lattice points. Shown in Figure 2 are the intensity contour plots for reciprocal space mapping around the cubic (400), (040), (004) reflections at 230 and 330 K, respectively. There are three peaks at 230 K in all these figures with different 2θ and ω values, respectively. On the other hand, there is only one peak at 330 K. From Figure 2, we can clearly see the following. (i) The crystal is in the orthorhombic symmetry at 230 K. Twins are present in it and the domain ratio for three twinning components, I:II:III, is roughly estimated using the integrated intensity ratio to be 10:2:3. The twin matrix is [0 1 0/0 0 1/1 0 0]. (ii) For the heating process from 230 K, the twinning domains are rearranged together with changing of the lattic parameters, and the good single-crystallinity of (17) Hall, S. R., King, G. S.

Figure 3 presents the temperature dependence of lattice parameters on the cooling process from 300 to 230 K. Because of the differences in the twinning domain ratio of 10:2:3 at low temperatures, the orthorhombic lattice parameters can be determined using the usual peak centering method for 25 well-characterized reflections on the four-circle diffractometer. The hysteresis in the transformation, already observed using powder samples by some researchers, is confirmed by our single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. The evidence of the tripled periodicity has been also found at low temperatures.

DEFECT SPINELS IN THE SYSTEM Li20.yMnO 2 (y>2.5): A NEUTRON-DIFFRACTION STUDY AND ELECTROCHEMICA[ CHARACTERIZATION OF Li2Mn409 A de Kock, M H Rossouw, L A de Picciotto and M M Thackeray* Division of Materials Science and Technology, CSIR, P 0 Box 395, Pretoria 0001, South Africa and W I F David and R M Ibberson Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OXll OQX, UK (Received February 19, 1990; Communicated by J.B. Goodenough) ABSTRACT The structure of the defect spinel Li2Mn409 which is a component of the system Li20.yMnO 2 (y = 4.0) has been determined by neutron diffraction analysis; it has the spinel notation (Li 0 89[--]0_ii) [Mnl 78[-I 0 22]04. The electrochemical prope÷ties of [ipMn4CTg" when hsed as an insertion electrode in rechargeable room-t6mpera-ture lithium cells have been evaluated. MATERIALS INDEX: lithium, manganese, oxides, spinels Introduction There has recently been much interest in reactions of manganeseand lithium salts at moderately high temperatures (350-450°C) for synthesising lithium-manganese-oxide electrodes for rechargeable lithium cells [1-4]. A previous report has shown that these reactions produce an electrochemically inactive rock salt phase Li2MnO 3 and an electrochemically active spinel phase in the system LixMn2-.O 4(0<x<I.33, 0<z<0.33) the composition of which depends on the LI:Mn ra#lo used and the temperature of preparation [5]. At temperatures below 400°C spinel phases are produced in which the manganese ions are all tetravalent; these phases may be defined by the solid-solution system LipO.yMnO2 where y>2.5. The end members of this system are Li4Mn5012 -[6] and the defect spinel phase ~-MnO 2 [7]; they have the general stoichiometries M304 and M02, respectivel#, where M represents the total lithiumand man~adese-ion Content in the compounds. This paper presents structural, chemical, electrochemical and physical properties of an intermediate phase of the system, Li2Mn409 (y = 4), which has the stoichiometry M203, *To whom correspondence should be addressed. 657 658 A. DE KOCK, et al. Vol. 25, No. 5 Experimental Single-phase LipMn409 was prepared by reaction of Li2CO 3 and MnC03 powder, intimatelg mix6d in a 1:4 molar ratio, at 400°C in air for five-hours. The reaction conditions were strictly controlled to prevent the loss of oxygen from LipMn40g that occurs when higher temperatures and longer reaction times are ~sed.Li Mn 0 was lithiated chemically with IM n-butyllithium in hexane at 2 40~C 9 an under argon atmosphere, and electrochemically at room temperature (22°C). Li20 was removed from Li2Mn409 by acid digestion in O.4M H~SO 4 for 20 hours at room temperature. For the electrochemical experiments the working electrode consisted of 20-§g mg Li2Mn40g compacted on to a stainless-steel gauze disc. A 20 W~/o mixture-of acetylene black and teflon (2:1 ratio) was added to the electrode to enhance its electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. A IM solution of LiCIO 4 in dimethoxyethane/propylene carbonate (1:1 mixture) was employed as electrolyte in all the electrochemical tests. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in three electrode cells using lithium-foil counterand reference electrodes. The voltage limits and scan rate, typically ImV/s, were controlled by a Princeton Applied Research (PAR) Model 173 Potentiostat coupled to a PAR Model 175 Universal Programmer. The electrode capacity utilization and cycling efficiency of Li/Li2Mn409 cells were determined in two-electrode cell~; initial discharge capacities of cells, when discharged at 0.1 mA/cm 2, were calculated to a cut-off voltage of 2.0V. Cycling of c~lls was carried o#t at charge and discharge current rates of 0.125 mA/cm ~ and 0.250 mA/cm% respectively, between voltage limits of 3.6V and 2.0V. Time of flight (TOF) neutron-diffraction data of Li?Mn400 were collected on the high-resolution powder diffractometer (HRPD)-At the spallation neutron source (ISIS) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. The structures were refined with a profile-refinement program modified to describe peak shape by a double decay exponential convoluted with a Voigt function [8, 9]. Neutron-scatterin~q, amplitudes used in the _~tructure refinement were b(Li)~= -0.203 x lO-'~cm, b(Mn) : -0.3730 x lO-12cm, and b(O) : 0.5804 x lO-~:cm [10]. Initial unit cell parameters were obtained from powder X-ray diffraction data of the sample. During structure refinement, 15 profile and 8 structural parameters were refined simultaneously. X-ray diffraction data of Li2Mn4Og, an acid-treated _ _ _ < < Li2Mn40 9 sample and lithiated products Li?+xMn409 (0 x_2.4) were col7ected in South Africa on an automated Rigaku ~6wder diffractometer with CuK~ radiation monochromated by a graphite single crystal. The part~icle-size distribution in LipMn409 samples was determined on a Malvern Instruments Master Particle 3izer-M3.0. Surface areas were obtained by the BET method using nitrogen gas. The lithium content in the various samples was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results and Discussion Stoichiometric spinels have the general formula A[B2]X 4 where A and B refer to cations on tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively, and X to the anions that form a cubic-close-packed array.

The stability of the spinel phases of this system at 400°C decreases as the concentration of the MnO 2 component, y, increases; it has been established that spinel structures can be synthesised at this temperature for compositions from Li4MnBOIR (y = 2.5), through Li2Mn 30 7 (y = 3), [11] to at l east-Lf?M-n40g (y = 4). If Li2Mn409.is heated above 400°C, particularly forlong -periods of time, oxygen is lost and defects are removed from the structure to leave LiMn204, according to the reaction: >400°C Li2Mn409 --P-2LiMn204 + ~02 (I) The thermal stability of phases for y > 4 is still to be determined. It is known, however, that ~-MnOp which is usually prepared at room temperature obY oxidation of LiMn204-in an acidic medium [7], is stable only to -250 C at which temperature it transforms to B-MnO 2.

A powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a sample with overall c66position Li 4 4Mn40g (average Mn valency is 3.40) (Fig. 2c) was dominated by peaks of the cubic phase, but contained, in addition, a few weak peaks of a second phase which has not yet been characterized, but which is believed to be a highly lithiated Li2+xMn409 phase with x>2.4.

Reaction of Li2Mn409 with O.4M H2SO 4 for 20 hours at room temperature, leaches out the [i20 component from the structure. The product contained 0.1% Li, which corresponds to a phase of composition Lio.o5Mn408.025; it has a lattice parameter of a = 8.069A. The powder X-ray diff-raL-tion pattern of this phase [Fig. 2d] is essentially that of ~-MnO 2 (a = 8.03 A) [7]. The discharge curve of a Li/Li2Mn40g cell which represents the electrochemical insertion of lithium inZo-Li2Mn409 at a low current rate of 0.1 mA/cm L is shown in Fig.+ 3. At [his discharge rate, the Li2Mn40g structure accommodates 3Li ions per formula unit, to a cu[-off-voltage of 2.0V. Although no detailed structure refinement of Li5Mn409 has been undertaken, the similarity of the peak intensities in the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of Li?Mn409 and the lithiated product Li 3 7Mn409 (Fig. 2a & b) indicate t-hat the manganese ions remain on the" B-sltes of the spinel framework structure during the lithiation process. A likely reaction for complete lithiation of Li2Mn409 to a rock salt composition Li5Mn409, in spinel notation, is therefore: (Lio.89[]O. ll)8a[Mnl. 7800.22] 16d04 ~ l.33Li (Li2)16c[Mn1.78Lio.22 ]16d04 (2) 662 A.

During this reaction the lithium ions on the tetrahedral 8a sites are initially displaced into neighbouring face-shared octahedra (the crystallographic 16c positions); in the fully lithiated structure all the octahedral sites are occupied by lithium and manganese ions. However, the possibility that a fraction of lithium ions remain on the 8a sites cannot be discounted as evidence for this phenomenon was observed in the related lithiated spinel phase Li2[Mn2]04 [12]. The cyclic voltammogram of an Li/Li2Mn40g cell, cycled between limits of 4.6V and 1.8V, illustrates thatthelithiation process of Li2Mn4O 9 is reversible (~ii~. 4a). With reference to reaction (2) it would appear that 1.33 ions are inserted into the defect spinel structure during the initial cathodic scan to form the rock salt phase Li5Mn409 (peak 1). However, during the anodic scan lithium extraction occurs in three stages which can be attributed to (i) removal of 75% of the inserted lithium ions from the octahedral sites 16c, (peak 2), which occurs with a simultaneous migration of the remaining lithium ions from the ]6c sites to the tetrahedral 8a sites to generate a stoichiometric spinel phase (Li)8 a [Mnl.~sLip.22116dO 4 and (ii) removal of the remaining 25% of the inserted ilthlum ions in a two-step process (peaks 3 and 4). Further structural data is required to determine whether this two-step process can be attributed to lithium extraction from only the 8a tetrahedral sites as has been observed for the system Lil_~[Mn?]O 4 [5, 13] or whether a fraction of the lithium ions is also remoCe~ fr6m the 16d octahedral sites. Peaks 5 and 6 correspond to the reverse process of 4 and 3, respectively, whereas peak 7 in the second cycle corresponds to the insertion of only one lithium ion per spinel unit to form the rock salt phase. Fig. 4b is the cyclic voltammogram of Li?Mn40g when cycled between 3.75V and 1.80V; it shows excellent rechargeabTe characteristics.

Conclusions In conclusion, there are several properties of Li2Mn409 that are worth highlighting, particularly when compared to LiMn204. (i) Li2Mn409 can be regarded as an oxygen-rich spinel with notation LiMneD 4 ~. The additional oxygen concentration which creates defe~t{'6n the A and B sites (in LiMn204 .the A and B sites are fully occupied) gives Li2Mn409 a slgnificantly greater theoretical electrode capacity (213 mAh/g) than LiMn?O 4 (148mAh/g) when the electrodes are discharged to the rock salt compositions Li5Mn409 and Li2Mn204, respectively. (ii) Electrochemical l i thiation of Li 2Mn40 9 to Li5Mn40 9 reduces the average manganese-ion valency from 4.00 to 3.25; the cubic symmetry of the electrode structure is maintained, at least to a composition Li 37Mn409 in which the average Mn valency is 3.56By. contrast, during the electrochemical reduction of LiMn. 2. 40 to Li Mn2 ~0 the average valency of the manganese ions ,s lowered higher rom 3.50 to . During this reaction the concentration of the d" ions induces a Jahn Teller distortion which reduces the crystal symmetry from cubic to tetragonal symmetry, and results in a two-phase electrode over the compositional range Li|._Mn~O, (0.08<x<2) [15]. However, data in this paper suggest thA{~a ~i~ilar process occurs in extensively lithiated Li2+ Mn409 samples for x>2 (i.e. when the average Mn valency is <~.5 as evidenced by the appearance of a minor concentration of a second phase in the X-ray diffraction pattern of Li4.4Mn409. 664 A. DE KOCK, et al. Vol. 25, No. 5 (iii) LiRMn40g electrodes exhibit a voltage of ~3.5V against pure liChium~hereas the lithium-deficient spinel electrodes in the system Li I xMn2O 4 exhibit significantly higher voltages (-4.0V); the laCter ~ectrodes are considered to be too highly oxidizing for the electrolytes currently employed which limits their usefulness in lithium cells. (iv) High surface areas (78 m2/g) and small average particle size (-3#m) characterize i n 0 9 electrodes when made by the method described in thi 2 4 paper. These properties account for the good electrochemical activity of this electrode. By contrast, LiMn~O 4 electrodes, which are synthes~ed typically above 600°C, yield m~ch lower surface areas (2-10m:/g). Consequently, Li/LiMn?O 4 cells show inferior electrochemical performance in terms of both-discharge capacity and Li+-ion diffusion rate when discharged at the same current density as Li/Li2Mn409 cells.

Toward Positive Electrode Materials with High-Energy Density: Electrochemical and Structural Studies on LiCoxMn2−xO4 with 0 ≤x ≤ 1 Kazuhiko Mukai* and Takeshi Uyama Toyota Central Research & Development Laboratories, Inc., 41-1 Yokomichi, Nagakute, Aichi 480-1192, Japan * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: To obtain positive electrode materials with higher energy densities (Ws), we performed systematic structural and electrochemical analyses for LiCoxMn2−xO4 (LCMO) with 0 ≤x ≤1. X-ray diffraction measurements and Raman spectroscopy clarified that the samples with x ≤0.5 are in the single-phase of a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, whereas the samples with x ≥0.75 are in a mixture of the spinel-phase and Li2MnO3 phase with the C2/m space group. The x-dependence of the discharge capacity (Qdis) indicated a broad maximum at x = 0.5, although the average operating voltage (Eave) monotonically increased with x. Thus, the W value obtained by Qdis × Eave reached the maximum (=627 mW h·g−1) at x = 0.5, which is greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. Furthermore, the change in the lattice volume (ΔV) during charge and discharge reactions approached 0%, that is, zero-strain, at x = 1. Because ΔV for x = 0.5 was smaller than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4, the x = 0.5 sample is found to be an alternative positive electrode material for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 with a high W. 1. INTRODUCTION The bottom line of batteries in baseball is the harmonizing of a pitcher and a catcher. In the same way, the balancing of the electrochemical performances between a positive electrode and a negative electrode is crucial for secondary batteries. As previously reviewed for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),1,2 the energy densities (Ws) for positive electrode materials are significantly lower than those for negative electrode materials. This imbalanced situation still restricts the widespread applications of LIBs, such as in electric vehicles (EVs) and stationary energy storage systems (ESSs).1 In other words, positive electrode materials with higher Ws are urgently required to realize more practical EVs and ESSs. The W value for a positive electrode material is determined as follows ∫ = × W Q Q E d recha ave (1) where Qrecha is the rechargeable capacity and Eave is the average operation voltage. Therefore, a positive electrode material with a high Qrecha or a high Eave or both provides a high W. Over the past decade, lithium−nickel−manganese spinel Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 has attracted much attention because it offers ∼135 mA h· g−1 of Qrecha and 4.5 V versus Li+/Li of Eave, resulting in more than 600 mW h·g−1 of W.3−6 Lithium−cobalt−manganese spinel LiCoxMn2−xO4 (LCMO) with 0 ≤x ≤1 is also promising from the viewpoint of Eave;7−13 namely, the redox reaction of Co3+ ↔Co4+ in LCMO is ∼0.3 V higher than that of Ni2+ ↔Ni4+ in Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4.3,4,8,9,11 Previous X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)8 analyses and magnetic measurements of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)14,15 and susceptibility16 indicated that Co ions in LCMO are in the trivalent state with a low-spin t2g 6 (S = 0) configuration. The ideal electrochemical reaction of LCMO is thus represented as → + + + − + + + − + − + + LiCo Mn Mn O Li e Co Mn Mn O x x x x 3 1 3 4 4 4 1 4 4 4 (2) where the theoretical capacity (Qtheo) is calculated to be (148.23 −3.21x) mA h·g−1. The current Qrecha for x = 1 is, however, significantly lower than Qtheo and is usually7−11 limited to ∼100 or 116 mA h·g−1 at the maximum.13 This comes from the presence of Li2MnO3 impurities in x = 1, which are electrochemically inactive.9 By contrast, the Eave for LCMO almost linearly increases on increasing the amount of the Co3+ ↔Co4+ redox reaction. Because W is the product obtained by the multiplication of Qrecha and Eave, as shown by eq 1, the opposite trend between Qrecha and Eave in LCMO is expected to indicate a maximum W value at a certain x composition. Despite the intensive studies on LCMO thus far,7−16 a Received: July 7, 2017 Accepted: August 15, 2017 Published: August 29, 2017 Article http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf © 2017 American Chemical Society 5142 DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00948 ACS Omega 2017, 2, 5142−5149 This is an open access article published under an ACS AuthorChoice License, which permits copying and redistribution of the article or any adaptations for non-commercial purposes.

In this contribution, we report the results of Qrecha, Eave, and W as a function of x in LCMO and compare them with Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. Structural analyses using synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and Raman spectroscopy were also performed to clarify the relation between the electrochemical properties and crystal structures of LCMO. Consequently, we revealed that the x = 0.5 composition provides the maximum W value of 627 mW h·g−1, with a change in the lattice volume of ∼4%. These performances were found to be superior to those of Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1. Particle Morphology. For positive electrode materials with high Eave values, the particle size and morphology significantly affect their electrochemical properties,17 probably due to the decomposition of electrolytes. To clarify changes in the particle size and morphology with x, Figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the LCMO samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x = 1. The x = 0 sample indicates a nonuniform particle shape with an average particle size (dave) of 2 μm. For the x = 0.5 and 1 samples, some particles show a truncated octahedral shape, although their dave values are similar to that of the x = 0 sample. As seen in Figure S1, particles for the x = 0.25 and 0.5 samples also show a truncated octahedral shape with dave of ∼2 μm. Thus, the substitution of Co ions for Mn ions mainly influences the particle morphology for LCMO. The Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 particles prepared by the two-step solid-state reaction technique exhibit an octahedral shape with smooth {111} facets, not a truncated octahedral shape.17 The difference between the octahedral and truncated octahedral shapes originates from the proportion of the {001} facets to {111} facets. One simple method to quantitatively describe such a difference is given by the Wulffconstruction18 α = V V 3 001 111 (3) where α is the facet growth velocity ratio and V001 and V111 are the growth velocities of the {001} and {111} facets, respectively. When α = 1, the particle indicates only the {001} facets, that is, cubic, whereas when α = 3, the particle indicates only the {111} facets, that is, regular octahedron.18 As seen from the x = 1 particle surrounded by a red dotted line in Figure 1c, the surface area of one {001} facet is estimated to be 1.1 μm2, whereas that of one {111} facet is estimated to be 3.9 μm2. Thus, the ratio of the {001} facets to {111} facets is estimated to be ∼0.2, resulting in 2.25 < α < 2.5. 2.2. Electrochemistry. Figure 2 shows the charge and discharge curves of the LCMO/Li cells with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.25, (c) x = 0.5, (d) x = 0.75, and (e) x = 1. For the x = 0 sample, the cell voltage rapidly increases to ∼4.0 V, then maintains an almost constant voltage at around 4.2 V up to a charge capacity (Qcha) of ∼80 mA h·g−1, and finally indicates another voltage plateau at around 5.2 V. The voltage plateau above 5.0 V is also reported for the charge curves for Li[LixMn2−x]O4 with 0 ≤x ≤1/3.19,20 The Qcha and discharge capacity (Qdis) at the initial cycle are 126 and 119 mA h·g−1, respectively. For the x = 0.25 and 0.5 samples, the Qcha values below ∼4.0 V decrease compared with that for x = 0; and in turn, the Qcha values above ∼5.0 V increase with x. The Qcha and Qdis values at the initial cycle are not different between the Figure 1. SEM images on the 5 μm scale for the LiCoxMn2−xO4 samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x = 1. One of the particles in the x = 1 sample (surrounded by the red dotted line) shows a truncated octahedron with a facet growth velocity ratio (α) of 2.25 < α < 2.5. Figure 2. Charge and discharge curves of the LiCoxMn2−xO4/Li cells with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.25, (c) x = 0.5, (d) x = 0.75, and (e) x = 1. The cells were operated at a current of 0.6 mA (0.3 mA·cm−2) in the voltage range between 3.0 and 5.4 V at 25 °C. ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00948 ACS Omega 2017, 2, 5142−5149 5143 x = 0.25 and 0.5 samples; that is, the Qcha and Qdis values are 147 and 138 mA h·g−1, respectively, for x = 0.25, and the Qcha and Qdis values are 146 and 140 mA h·g−1, respectively, for x = 0.5. However, as clearly seen from the intersecting voltages between the charge and discharge curves, the Eave value for x = 0.5 is expected to be greater than that for x = 0.25. For the x = 0.75 sample, the Qcha value at around 4.0 V is decreased to ∼25 mA h·g−1; however, the whole Qcha (=134 mA h·g−1) and Qdis (=127 mA h·g−1) values at the initial cycle are slightly decreased compared with those for x = 0.25 and 0.5. For the x = 1 sample, the Qcha and Qdis values at the initial cycle are further decreased to 112 and 108 mA h·g−1, respectively, in exchange for the almost disappearance of the Qcha value at around 4.0 V. Such Qcha and Qdis values are similar to the reported values for x = 1.7−13 According to the previous XANES analyses8 and EPR measurements,14,15 the electrochemical reaction at around 4.0 V is attributed to the redox reaction of Mn3+ ↔Mn4+, whereas that at around 5.0 V is attributed to the redox reaction of Co3+ ↔Co4+. The small amount of Qdis at around 4.0 V in x = 1 indicates that the Mn3+ ions still exist in the sample, although its ideal chemical formula is described as Li[Co3+Mn4+]O4. Figure S2 shows the charge and discharge curves for the x = 1 sample prepared at 1000 and 1100 °C. As the maximum heating temperature increases, the Qdis value decreases; for example, Qdis = 72 mA h·g−1 for 1100 °C. This is because the amount of the Li2MnO3 impurity increases, as later shown in Figures 4c and 6c. Figure 3 shows the x-dependence of (a) Qdis at the initial cycle, (b) Eave of the initial discharge curve, and (c) W obtained by Qdis × Eave. Results of Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 with the P4332 space group5 are also shown for comparison. The xdependence of Qdis indicates a broad maximum at around x = 0.5, whereas Eave almost monotonically increases from 4.166 V at x = 0 to 4.996 V at x = 1. The observed Qdis is lower than the calculated Qtheo over the whole x range. Consequently, W gradually increases from 480 mW h·g−1 at x = 0, then reaches the maximum (=627 mW h·g−1) at x = 0.5, and finally decreases to 516 mW h·g−1 at x = 1. The maximum W value for x = 0.5 is slightly greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (=607 mW h·g−1), and as far as we are concerned, the x-dependence of W in LCMO has been clarified for the first time because previous studies on LCMO were focused on the Qdis values.7−16 2.3. Crystal Structure. In this section, we examined the crystal structures before and after the charge reaction to understand the electrochemical reaction scheme of LCMO. Figure 4 shows the results for the Rietveld analyses for the pristine (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x = 1 samples. The crystal structure for x = 0 is assigned as a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, in which Li+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ ions occupy tetrahedral 8a and octahedral 16d sites, respectively. Structural parameters, such as the cubic lattice parameter ac [=8.2225(1) Å] and oxygen positional parameter u [=0.264(1)], are consistent with the previous results for LiMn2O4 (Table 1).19−21 Before describing the result for x = 0.5, we wish to mention the result for x = 1. The majority of the x = 1 sample is in the Fd3̅m space group, as in the case for x = 0. However, as seen in the inset of Figure 4c, the diffraction lines indicated by * are clearly observed in the vicinity of the diffraction line around 2θ = 10° (the 111 diffraction line of the spinel structure). These diffraction lines originate from the Li2MnO3 phase with the monoclinic structure, whose weight fraction is determined to be Figure 3. Results of the electrochemical measurements for the LiCoxMn2−xO4 samples with 0 ≤x ≤1: (a) discharge capacity at the initial cycle (Qdis), (b) average voltage (Eave) of the initial discharge curve, and (c) energy density (W) obtained by Qdis × Eave. The solid line indicates the Qtheo for LCMO calculated by (148.23 −3.21x) mA h·g−1. The results for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 with the P4332 space group are taken from ref 5. Figure 4. Results of the Rietveld analyses for the pristine LiCoxMn2−xO4 samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x = 1. Enlarged XRD patterns are also shown in the insets to clarify the presence of the Li2MnO3 phase (indicated by *). The 220 diffraction in x = 1 indicates the presence of Co ions at the tetrahedral 8a site. ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00948 ACS Omega 2017, 2, 5142−5149 5144 6.23%. Coexistence of the Li2MnO3 phase is also reported in previous structural analyses on x = 1.9 Moreover, the intensity of the 220 diffraction line at around 2θ = 17° is slightly larger than that for x = 0 [compare Figure 4a,c], indicating that a small amount of metal (Co) ions exists in the tetrahedral 8a site. As a result, the crystal structure for the x = 1 sample is assigned as a mixture of the spinel phase with the Fd3̅m space group and the Li2MnO3 impurity with the C2/m space group. Because the amount of Co ions at the 8a site is determined to be 0.113(1), the actual formula for x = 1 can be represented as Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4. Note that the mixture of 93.77 wt % Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 and 6.23 wt % Li2MnO3 is consistent with the Li/Co/Mn (=1/1/1) composition of the starting material: mol % of Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 and Li2MnO3 are calculated to be 89.3 and 10.7, respectively, providing the composition of Li/Co/Mn = 1.01/0.99/1.00. The Li2MnO3 impurity is not observed in the x = 0.5 sample [see Figure 4b]. The crystal structure for x = 0.5 is thus assigned as the single-phase of the spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group. Figure S3 shows the results for the Rietveld analyses for the pristine (a) x = 0.25 and (b) x = 0.75 samples. The situation for x = 0.25 is similar to that for x = 0.5; the sample crystallized into a single-phase of the spinel structure. By contrast, the Li2MnO3 impurity was observed in the XRD pattern for the x = 0.75 sample [see diffraction lines indicated by * in Figure S3b]. The weight fraction of the Li2MnO3 phase in x = 0.75 is determined to be 1.67%, and the actual formula for x = 0.75 can be represented as Li0.970Co0.030[CoMn]O4. As seen from Figure S4, the amount of the Li2MnO3 phase in LCMO rapidly increases at x ≥0.75. We next examined the distributions of the Li2MnO3 phase in the x = 1 sample by Raman spectroscopy. Figure S5 shows the Raman spectra for the LCMO samples with 0 ≤x ≤1. According to a factor group analysis,22 five Raman active modes of A1g + Eg + 3F2g are predicted for the spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group. The Raman spectrum for x = 0 shows a major Raman band at around 623 cm−1 and three minor Raman bands at 572, 477, and 365 cm−1. The major Raman band is assigned as the A1g mode, which corresponds to a symmetric vibration between Mn3+/Mn4+ and O2−ions.16,23 The major Raman band at around 623 cm−1 splits into two or three Raman bands with x, probably due to the change in the proportion of Mn3+/Mn4+ ions.16 As seen in Figure 5a, the x = 1 sample indicates three major Raman bands at around 652, 575, and 538 cm−1 and three minor Raman bands at around 475, 382, and 179 cm−1. Although these Raman bands are still unassigned, the Raman spectrum for x = 1 significantly differs from that for the single-phase of Li2MnO3 [Figure 5b]. This enables the LiCoMnO4 sample to be distinguished into Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 and Li2MnO3 phases. As provided in Figure 5c, the Li2MnO3 phase segregates from the Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 phase, not coexisting in the Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 phase. Figure 6 shows the results of the Rietveld analyses for the fully charged LCMO samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x =1. Figure S6 shows the results of the fully charged LCMO samples with (a) x = 0.25 and (b) x = 0.75. Here “fully” means the lithium cells were charged up to 5.4 V before the XRD measurements. The y values were calculated to be y = 0.15 for x = 0, y ≈0 for x = 0.25, y ≈0 for x = 0.5, y = 0.08 for x = 0.75, and y = 0.228 for x = 1, by ignoring the capacities Table 1.

As seen from Figures 6 and S6, all LCMO samples maintain a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, as in the cases for the initial (pristine) state. Structural parameters, such as ac and u, are summarized in Table 2. 2.4. Δac and ΔV for LCMO. Figure 7a shows the ac values before and after the fully charged reaction as a function of x in LiCoxMn2−xO4. The ac value before the charge reaction (pristine sample) monotonically decreases from 8.2225(1) Å at x = 0 to 8.0589(1) Å at x = 1. This linear decrease in ac agrees with the change in the ionic radius (r) from Mn3+ ions with CN = 6 (rMn 3+ = 0.58 Å) to Co3+ ions (rCo 3+ = 0.55 Å) with CN = 6, where CN is the coordination number.24 The ac value after the fully charged reaction also indicates a linear decrease in ac with x, however, its slope (ac/x) is much smaller than that for the LCMO samples before the charge reaction. That is, the ac value slightly decreases from 8.0581(1) Å at x = 0 to 8.0083(1) Å at x = 1. Using these ac values for LCMO, the change in ac (Δac) and the change in the lattice volume (ΔV) are determined. As seen in Figure 7b, both Δac and ΔV values decrease with increasing x; for instance, Δac = −1.99% and ΔV = −5.88% for x = 0, Δac = −1.36% and ΔV = −4.01% for x = 0.5, and Δac = −0.63% and ΔV = −1.87% for x = 1. Here, the Δac and ΔV values for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 are calculated to be −1.98 and −5.83%, respectively, using the reported ac values before (=8.167 Å) and after (=8.005 Å) the fully charged reaction.4 Therefore, the Δac and ΔV values for x = 0.5 are smaller than those for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4, although the W value for x = 0.5 is greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. It should be noted that the Δac and ΔV values for x = 1 are significantly smaller compared with those for other positive electrode materials, such as LiCoO2 (ΔV ≈+2.5% at the halfcharged state)25 and LiFePO4 (ΔV ≈−6.9%).26 The ΔV value of −1.87% for x = 1 can be regarded as a “zero-strain” lithium insertion material because one of the zero-strain lithium insertion materials, Li[CrTi]O4, indicates a ΔV of +0.7%.27,28 Thus far, this statement has not been explicitly expressed, although Alcántara et al.10 reported the change in ac for LiyCoMnO4. Zero-strain lithium insertion materials such as Li[CrTi]O4 and Li[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4 (LTO)29−31 are used as negative electrode materials, whereas the x = 1 sample is used as a positive electrode material. XRD and Raman spectroscopy clarified that the zero-strain reaction scheme of LTO is achieved by a change in u on proceeding with the discharge reaction, that is, local structural changes in the LiO6 and TiO6 environments.30,31 To compare with such a zero-strain reaction scheme, u values during various charge states were determined by the Rietveld analyses for x = 1. As shown in Figure 8a, u for LiyCoMnO4 maintains a constant value (∼0.263) up to the fully charged state, suggesting that the zero-strain reaction scheme for x = 1 is different from that for LTO. Considering the ac value (∼8.00 Å) at the fully charged state, one can understand the zero-strain reaction scheme for x = 1. That is, the minimum ac value for face-centered cubic (FCC) consisting of only O2−ions is calculated to be ∼7.8 Å, using the relations = − a r 4 2 c O2 and rO 2−= 1.38 Å (CN = 4) [see Figure 8b]. Hence, the zero-strain character for x = 1 is achieved by a rigid framework structure of O2−with FCC packing. In other words, negative electrode materials with zero-strain are due to reversible changes in the local structures, whereas positive electrode materials with zerostrain are due to invariance in the local structures. Finally, we wish to describe the strategy for positive electrode materials with more high-energy density. Although the x = 0.5 sample indicates the maximum W value among the various spinel oxides, its W value is still lower than layered oxides; for instance, layered oxides comprising Li/Ni/Mn/O2,32 exhibit more than 300 mA h·g−1 of Qdis and ∼3.5 V of Eave, resulting in more than 1000 mW h·g−1 of W. The present findings confirm that the redox reaction of Co3+ ↔Co4+ is effective to increase Figure 5. Raman spectra for the (a) LiCoxMn2−xO4 sample with x = 1 and (b) Li2MnO3. (c) Two-dimensional Raman mapping for the x = 1 sample in the region of width 100 μm and height 25 μm. The regions of Li1−δCo1+δMnO4 and Li2MnO3 phases are shown by red and blue, respectively.

Thus, layered oxides comprising Li/Co/Mn/O would exhibit greater W values, although the combination of Co and Mn ions in the layered structure is reported to be thermodynamically unstable.33 Trials for preparing layered Li/Co/Mn/O oxides are underway in our laboratory. 3. CONCLUSIONS To pair harmoniously with the high W value negative electrode materials, explorations for positive electrode materials with high W values have been performed in a series of LCMO spinels with 0 ≤x ≤1. The maximum Qdis value for LCMO was exhibited at x = 0.5, whereas Eave increased monotonically with Table 2.

ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00948 ACS Omega 2017, 2, 5142−5149 5147 x. Therefore, the maximum W value (=627 mW h·g−1) was obtained at the x = 0.5 composition. The W value for x = 0.5 was slightly greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4, which has attracted much attention as a positive electrode material because of its high W value. XRD measurements using synchrotron radiation clarified another advantage for the x = 0.5 sample; that is, the ΔV value for x = 0.5 was about 2% smaller than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. Thus, the x = 0.5 sample is regarded as a next-generation positive electrode material with a high W value and a long cycle-life. Concerning the ΔV values, the x = 1 sample showed the minimum ΔV value (=−2%) among the various positive electrode materials and can be thought of as a zero-strain lithium insertion material, similar to LTO and Li[CrTi]O4. The zero-strain character for x = 1 is due to the invariance in the local structures, which is different from those for LTO and Li[CrTi]O4. 4. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 4.1. Synthesis and Characterization. Powder samples of LCMO with x = 0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 were prepared using a two-step solid-state reaction technique, as reported previously,4,5,19 to obtain highly crystallized LCMO samples. Regent grade LiOH·H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), Co3O4 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.), and MnO2 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) were mixed with a pestle and mortar and then pressed into a pellet of diameter 23 mm and thickness ∼5 mm. The pellet was first sintered at 900 °C for 12 h under flowing oxygen and then heated at 700 °C for 24 h, 600 °C for 24 h, and 500 °C for 48 h, successively, without cooling to room temperature between each temperature step. The heating and cooling rates were 200 and 60 °C·h−1, respectively. The effects of heating temperature were investigated only for x = 1; we set the first sintering temperature to 1000 °C or 1100 °C. A powder sample of Li2MnO3 was also synthesized. The reaction mixture of LiOH· H2O and MnO2 was heated at 900 °C for 12 h under flowing oxygen. The obtained LCMO samples with 0 ≤x ≤1 were characterized by powder XRD measurements equipped with Fe Kα radiation (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS, Inc.), SEM (S3600N, Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Ltd.), and Raman spectroscopy (NRS-3300, Jasco Co. Ltd.). XRD measurements were conducted in the 2θ range between 15 and 140° at a stepscan rate of 0.014°. Raman spectroscopy was performed using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, supplied by a diodepumped solid-state laser. Before the measurements, the sharp Raman shift of crystalline silicon was calibrated as 520 cm−1. The laser power and duration for taking one Raman spectrum were 1 mW and 720 s, respectively. For the x = 1 sample, a twodimensional mapping for the Raman spectra was recorded using the excitation wavelength of 532 nm, to obtain information about distributions of Li1−δCoδ[CoMn]O4 and Li2MnO3 phases (inVia Raman microscope, Renishaw plc.). Here, δ is the amount of Co ions at the tetrahedral 8a (Li) site. The area for the Raman mapping was 100 × 25 μm. The laser power and duration for taking one spot of the Raman spectrum were 0.5 mW and 20 s, respectively. 4.2. Electrochemical Measurements. Electrochemical properties for the LCMO samples were examined in a nonaqueous lithium cell. The mixed electrode consisted of 88 wt % LCMO, 6 wt % conducting carbon, and 6 wt % polyvinylidene binder, as reported previously.5,19 The surface area of the electrode was ∼2.00 cm2 (φ 16 mm). A stainless steel plate (φ 19 mm) was pressed onto the lithium metal and used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC/DMC = 3/7 by volume) solution (KISHIDA Chemical Co. Ltd.). After fabricating the lithium cells in an argon-filled glovebox, the cells were operated at a current of 0.6 mA (≈0.3 mA·cm−2) in the voltage range between 3.0 and 5.4 V. This applied current corresponds to ∼2 C rate. The temperature for the electrochemical measurements was 25 °C. 4.3. Synchrotron Radiation Study. To clarify changes in the crystal structures in the charged states, XRD measurements were also performed at the synchrotron radiation facility, Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center. All of the charged LCMO samples were prepared using electrochemical reactions and packed into borosilicate capillary tubes with a diameter of 0.3 mm (W. Müller Glas Technik) in the argon-filled glovebox. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range between 5 and 95° using the two-dimensional detector (PILATUS 100 K, DECTRIS Ltd.) of the BL5S2 beamline. The wavelength of Xray was determined to be 0.779547(3) Å from the XRD measurement of a silicon standard (NIST 640d). Rietveld analyses were carried out using the RIETAN-FP software,34 and the schematics of the crystal structures were drawn by the VESTA software.35 The weight fraction, that is, the mol fraction of the LCMO and Li2MnO3 phases were determined by the multiphase mode in the RIETAN-FP program. ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00948.

In order to mitigate above problems, various approaches have been attempted [2e4]. One of these approaches is to substitute Mn with transition metal elements into the bulk for the purpose to strengthen the crystal structure [5] and the other approach is modification by coating [6e8]. It has been addressed that JahneTeller distortions can be subdued by the substitution because of the decrease content of Mn3þ. There are many recent works on Ni doping modification and the obtained results showed that Ni doping could improve the electrochemical properties of LiMn2O4 [9e16]. Q. Wei showed that doping with Ni into the Mn sites can stabilize the structure and improve the cycling stability of LiMn2O4 [17]. H.M. Wu revealed that the Ni doped LiNixMn2xO4 could increase the discharge capacities and improve the long cycle-life markedly [18]. Chen found that Ni, Mo co-doped can reduce Mn dissolution and significantly improved electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 [19]. In spite of the finite improvement of cycle properties through doping the heterogeneous elements, LiMn2O4 still suffered from capacity attenuation owing to the disproportionation reaction of Mn dissolution stimulated by HF acid which is related to the electrolyte decomposition [20e23]. Therefore, surface coating modifications have been widely employed to prevent the interface contact so that inhibit the Mn dissolution reaction [24]. Many achieved studies showed that surface coating with various metal oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2 and ZnO on the surface of cathode materials can efficiently improve their electrochemical properties [25,26]. Y. Shang reported that TiO2 coating on the spinel surface can suppress the undesired SEI film and enhance the resistance of LiMn2O4 against hydrogen fluoride attack from the electrolytes [27]. Although there were plenty of reports aiming to improve the cycling stability of the LiMn2O4 materials, combination of doping and surface coating still remain in skimp and worth study. Previous reports have shown that the Ni2þ doping can stabilize the structure, reducing JahneTeller distortions greatly, and metal oxide coatings can be taken to prevent the cathode from electrode/ electrolyte interface undesired reaction, yielding an artificial protective layer. In the paper, we proposed the recombine doping Ni2þ into the bulk and surface coating modifications with Co3O4 and the * Corresponding author. E-mail address: xuyunlong@ecust.edu.cn (Y. Xu).

All rights reserved. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 693 (2017) 474e481 various contents of Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 were successfully synthesized via a thermal decomposition method. The effect of Co3O4 coating on LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials and their electrochemical properties were investigated and discussed systematically. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Synthesis of LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials were synthesized via a sol-gel method using citric acid (AR, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc) as the chelating agent. Firstly, 0.5245 g lithium hydroxide monohydrate (AR, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc) and 1.0507 g citric acid was added in deionized water at 50 C. Then 0.0933 g Nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate (AR, Aladdin Chemical Co. Ltd.) and 6.0353 g manganese (II) acetate tetrahydrate (AR, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc.), molar ratio of 0.03:1.97, were dissolved and the solution was in 80 C oil. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide (AR, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc). The gel was totally dried and put into furnace pre-annealed at 350 C for 4 h and then calcinated at 750 C for 12 h under air atmosphere. The pure LiMn2O4 was synthesized under the same condition. 2.2. Synthesis of Co3O4 coating LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials The Co3O4 coating LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials were synthesized by the following step: the mixture of as-prepared pristine LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 powders with cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate (AR, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc) was in ethanol in ratios of (1.0 wt%, 2 wt%, 4.0 wt% the mass ratio of Co3O4 which is 1:99 ratio of Co3O4:LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4). The mixture were ultrasonically agitated for 20 min and then mechanical stirred for 60 min subsequently, the mixture was dried at 80 C followed by annealed at 400 C for 3 h under air atmosphere and Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials were obtained after cooling to room temperature. The samples LiMn2O4 and LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 (1.0 wt%, 2.0 wt%, 4.0 wt%) are marked as pristine LMO, N-0C-LMO, N-1C-LMO, N-2C-LMO and N-4C-LMO respectively. 2.3. Materials characterization The crystallographic structure analysis was performed on powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX, 2550V, Japan) with Cu-Ka radiation (l 1⁄4 1.54056 Å) and the obtained data was analyzed by software as well. C4H6CoO4$4H2O as the coating precursor was examined by a thermal gravimetric analysis (SDT Q600, Switzerland) with 10 C min1 of heating. The powder morphological feature characterization was carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy that connected with SEM was applied to determine the elements content of the 2.0 wt% Co3O4coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample and the Li elements cannot detected owing to the extremely small size. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2010, JEOL) was carried out to observe the morphology feature of obtained samples. 2.4. Electrochemical tests The electrochemical tests of the cathode material were investigated in button cell (2032 type) using Li metal as the anode. The cathode material powder, acetylene black (used as conduct material) and the binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were homogeneous mixed in mass ratio of 80:10:10 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to fabricate the working electrode. The mixture was then cast on aluminum foil and totally dried at 120 C for 10 h under vacuum condition. The cathode loading is 1.7 mg/cm2 and the assemble procedure of button cells were conducted in the argonfilled glove box with the separator (porous polypropylene film, Celgard 2320). The EC (ethylene carbonate) and DMC (dimethyl carbonate) were used as solvent (at 1:1 vol ratio) to dissolve 1 M LiPF6 forming the electrolyte. The cells were placed to age for overnight to activation. Charge-discharge results were galvanostatically tested by the Land tester (CT2001A) between 3.0 and 4.4 V (vs. Li/Liþ) at 25 C and 55 C under the constant current density of 1C rate. The cyclic voltammetry (CV, 0.1 mV s1, 3.0e4.4 V) curves were obtained by the Electrochemical Workstation (CHI, 660B). The AC impedance spectra were proceeded at a frequency range of 105 Hze102 Hz and the voltage bias is 3.0 V. The obtained AC impedance spectra were matched by the ZSim Demo software. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure and morphology analyses The XRD characterized the crystal structure of various synthesized pristine LiMn2O4 and Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 and the patterns were shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peak corresponding 2q of Si is used as the internal standard and the displacement error is 0.10. It is observed from the patterns that no apparent changes of diffraction peak intense with the different coating amount of cobalt oxide layer on LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4. All the sample patterns exhibit the same typical spinel phase of LiMn2O4 with the standard card (350782) in the Fd-3m symmetry and no peaks due to impurities were detected. The Rietveld refinement has been provided and the site occupancy of cations can described as [Li] 8a [Mn1.97 Ni0.03]16dO4 and the 16 d location occupancy of cations is Mn 0.985, Co 0.000 Li 0.000, Ni 0.015 indicates that the Ni occupied in the16 d sites. The Rp is 7.14, Rwp 4.87, Rexp 5.51 respectively. This demonstrates that the Ni doping and cobalt oxide coating does not change the structures of LiMn2O4. The crystallite size of all the samples are all about 150 nm according to Scherrer formula D 1⁄4 kl/Bcosq. In Table 1, the lattice parameter changes of the various samples were observed through the diffraction patterns using MDI Jade5.0 software. As seen from Table 1, the lattice parameter of crystallites of pure LiMn2O4 is 8.2465 Å while the Ni doped (sample N-0C-LMO) is 8.2410 Å resulting of the ions radius effect. Because Ni2þ ion substitute Mn3þ ions located in 16d sites and the introduction of Ni2þ Fig. 1. XRD patterns of pristine LiMn2O4 and various Ni and Co3O4 coating samples. Q. Wang et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 693 (2017) 474e481 475 can decrease the Mn3þ content on the contrary increasing the Mn4þ to maintain the valence balance, the shorter radius of Mn4þ than Mn3þ which the RMn3þ 1⁄4 0.64 Å, RMn4þ 1⁄4 0.53 Å, and RNi2þ 1⁄4 0.69 Å, CN 1⁄4 6 as well [28e30], the lattice showed a shrinkage after the Ni doping. On the other hand, the ionic bond energy of Ni-O is higher than the Mn-O bond considering the decrease of Mn3þ which is closely related to the JahneTeller effect [31], the crystal structure stability was enhanced during the cycles [32]. It is observed that there is no obvious changes of the lattice parameters among the coating samples indicates that the Co3O4 would not turn into the cubic spinel structure. Thermogravimetric measurement was carried out to confirm the chemical composition of the coating material C4H6CoO4$4H2O and the obtained curve were shown in Fig. 2. A drastic weight loss can be observed from 76 C on account of the removal of water molecules in the sample and the value is 29.71%. The DTG curve calculation shows that another weight loss is appearing from 350 C for the reason that the ongoing chemical reaction of phase transformation and the weight loss is 38.34%. The reactions are as follows [33]: CoðCH3COOÞ2Þ$4H2O/ D CoðCH3COOÞ2 þ 4H2O[ (1) 3CoðCH3COOÞ2 þ 25 2 O2/ D Co3O4 þ 12CO2[ þ 9H2O[ (2) Hence, we selected 400 C as the efficient temperature for the coating. The octahedral morphologies and element distribution of the Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 materials were observed through the SEM and EDS characterization. The observed SEM images of bare LiMn2O4 in Fig. 3(a), LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 in Fig. 3(b) and 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples in Fig. 3(c) are presented. As shown from the SEM images that the samples consist by particles with the size range of 200e300 nm and the surface of pristine LiMn2O4 shows a sharp surface, while the coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples display much coarser and rougher surface, indicating that surface of LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 has been successfully coated by Co3O4. The EDS analyses in the selected 2 wt% Co3O4 coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample region were performed so as to investigate the element distribution and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Fig 4(a) are the integral element distribution and Fig. 4(b) and (c) represent the mapping results of each individual elements of Mn, Ni, Co and O respectively. It can be distinctly observed from Fig. 4(b) that the Ni elements are in a homogeneous distribution meaning that the Ni doped in the crystal uniformly. Likewise, to further investigate the Co3O4 coating layer on the surface of cathode materials, the pure LiMn2O4 and 2 wt% Co3O4 coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample were analyzed via HR-TEM in Fig. 5(a) and (b). As can be seen in Fig. 5(a), no coating layer was observed on the pristine LiMn2O4 surface. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 5(a) and (b) indicates that the spinel LiMn2O4 is highly crystalline, and the lattice spacing of 0.47 nm are identical with that of the LiMn2O4 (111) plane. It can be seen clearly that Co3O4 coating forms over the LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 particles and the thickness of Co3O4 layer is about 6 nm which indicates that Co3O4 layer is successfully coated on the surface of the sample in Fig. 5(b) [34]. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer was performed to obtain the specific surface area and pore diameter distribution information of the Co3O4 coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample. Fig. 6 shows the curves of N2 adsorption-desorption measured through the liquid nitrogen and the insert image is the obtained pore diameter distribution situation. As analysis result shown from Fig. 6 that the primary pore diameter is 3.74 nm meanwhile the obtained value of specific surface area is 1.93 m2 g1 and the volume of pores is 0.0071 cm3 g1 between 1.70 nm and 300.00 nm. The pore diameter and specific surface area were relatively lower versus to the other porous electrode materials [35,36]. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were belonged to the type II curve and a small hysteresis loop with a relative pressure (P/Po) between 0.1 and 0.9 can be seen from the curve implying that only few mesopores were existed in the structure of 2 wt% Co3O4 coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample [37]. The primary pore diameter is 3.67 nm and the specific surface area is 1.90 m2 g1 of the pristine LiMn2O4. the pore diameter and the specific surface area showed a tiny decrease after Co3O4 coating which may mainly due to the Co3O4 particle enter the LiMn2O4 pores partly, causing the slightly difference of the samples. The few pore structure was benefit for its compaction density meanwhile the lower specific surface area the less contact area between the Mn and electrolyte interface therefore dwindling the HF acid erosion, minimizing the tendency of Mn dissolution ultimately [38]. 3.2. Electrochemical characteristics The constant current charge-discharge test was performed to investigate the influence of Ni2þ and Co3O4 layer on the electrochemical characteristic of LiMn2O4 cathode material. Fig. 7 exhibits the first charge-discharge profiles of pristine and surface modified LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples at 0.5C between the potential of 3.0 V and 4.3 V (versus Li/Liþ) at 25 C. From the plots in Fig. 7, the apparent discharge voltage plateaus were clearly observed from the chargedischarge curves of all the samples. The two potential regions were around 4.1 V and 3.9 V corresponding to the Li ions extraction from the active materials (LiMn2O4 / Li0.5Mn2O4 þ 0.5Liþ þ 0.5e) and crystal phase transition (Li0.5Mn2O4 / 2l-MnO2 þ 0.5Liþ þ 0.5e) which are in accordance with the discharge characteristic of the spinel LiMn2O4 [39,40]. The first discharge capacity of the pristine LiMn2O4 is 118.1 mAhg1, while those of sample LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4, Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 (1.0 wt%, 2.0 wt%, 4.0 wt%) are 120.5, Table 1 Crystal parameters of various synthesized samples.

The discharge capacities of coated samples exhibit a slight higher than that of pristine one while the decrease of 4.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample may due to the nimiety of Co3O4 coating on Fig. 3.

Wang et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 693 (2017) 474e481 477 the active spinel LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4. The rate performances of all the samples were performed in the discharge current of 0.5C to the 10C top and finally recovered at 1 C again (five cycles at each rate) in Fig. 8. The samples revealed the synchronous capacities fading with the augment of discharge rate which can be explained by the electron transport and Liþ diffusion through the particles and the electrolyte interface which were the crucial process for the rate properties [41]. Significantly, the 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample delivered the preferable capacity in spite of any rates with superior rate stability than other samples may attributed to the reversible lithiation/delithiation under different rate as well as the effectively inhibited Mn dissolution from the inside LiMn2O4 electrode to the electrolyte, resulting in a lower Mn dissolution [42]. Because the good reversibility of Co3O4 coated sample but also the prevention of the direct contact between HF acid and the inner manganese from dissolving into the electrolyte, the 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 exhibited improved cycling stability [43]. The discharge capacities of 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 are 124.5 mAhg1 at 0.5C, 121.3 mAhg1 at 1C, 115.5 mAhg1 at 2C, 108.1 mAhg1 at 5C and 100 mAhg1 at 10C rates, respectively, which indicates that the 2.0 wt% Co3O4 coating is the most proper ratio to enhance the electrochemical properties of LiMn2O4. The long-term cycling performances of all synthesized samples were carried out at room temperature (25 C) at the chargedischarge current of 1C in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, the pristine LiMn2O4 only possesses the initial discharge capacity was 117.3 mAhg1 which decayed to 85.6 mAhg1 after 100 cycles remaining the 72.7% capacity approximately. Contrarily, the Co3O4 coated samples exhibited a certain improvement during the longFig. 5. TEM images of (a) pristine LiMn2O4 and (b) 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample. Fig. 6.

The improved electrochemical performance mainly derived from two facts: (i) the more stable crystal structure by reason of the forming of partly intense Ni-O bond and the decrease of Mn3þ content which is beneficial for dwindling the Jahn-Teller distortion [9,17], (ii) Co3O4 layer effectively inhibiting the Mn dissolution from the LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 electrode into the electrolyte, resulting in a lower charge-transfer resistance [44e46]. In addition, it can be observed from the figure that the coating amount of 2.0 wt% Co3O4 coated sample exhibit the best cycling property however the cycling performance was deteriorating with the Co3O4 coating amount increases from 2.0 wt% up to 4.0 wt%. This manifests that there is an optimal amount of the Co3O4 layer content and once exceed the amount, it is adverse for improving the electrochemical performance. Fig. 10 shows the cyclic performances of pristine LiMn2O4, LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 and 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples at the high temperature (55 C) and discharge current of 1C. As expected, all samples especially pure LiMn2O4, showed capacity decay during the charge-discharge cycling which is mainly caused by the aggravated Jahn-Teller effect at high temperature [16]. The Initial capacities of the pristine LiMn2O4, LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 and 2 wt % Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples are 118.5 mAhg1 118.7 mAhg1120.0 mAhg1 and the discharge capacity after 100th are 78.2 mAhg1 92.4 mAhg1 98.2 mAhg1 respectively. The capacity retention of all the samples is 66.3% 77.8% 81.8% respectively at a current density of 148 mA/g. It can be obviously seen that the specific capacity of pristine LiMn2O4 decreased more rapidly compared with other samples at elevated temperatures. The HF acid was generated more aggravate at high temperature because of the LiPF6 decomposition which is related to the inevitable puny H2O content. Relative references showed uniform coating layer can prevent Mn4þ ions from direct contact with the electrolyte and greatly decrease the capacity loss [47]. This result indicates the Ni doping and Co3O4 layer coating can significantly enhance stability the spinel structure and prevent the dissolution of Mn from the reaction with HF acid, contributing to the better electrochemical properties at high temperature. The cyclic voltammograms of the pristine LiMn2O4, LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 and 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 cells are carried out in the voltage between 3.0 V and 4.4 V at the scan rate of 0.1 mV1 after 100th discharge and the obtained curves were showed in Fig.11. The CV curves of all the samples have two obvious redox peaks accorded with the intrinsic characteristic of the LiMn2O4. It can be seen from the CV curves that all the samples displayed apparent redox peaks and identical shapes of the curve, indicating that both the doping and coating would not change the inner redox potentials during the insert-extract process. The peak potential is slightly broadened increased, suggesting that the Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample has good reversibility and specific capacity. High intensity of peak currents ascribed to the improvement of the reversibility and electrochemical performances [17]. However, two pairs of anodic and cathodic peaks of 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample are much sharper and stable than other samples, which imply the effective improvement and the stabilization of the LiMn2O4 structure from the Ni doping and Co3O4 layer coating. To further investigate the role of Ni doping and Co3O4 coating layer for LiMn2O4, the AC impedance spectroscopy was performed on the pristine LiMn2O4, LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 and 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples at a frequency range of 105 Hze102 Hz.

Wang et al. / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 693 (2017) 474e481 479 the insert equivalent circuit diagram are shown in Fig. 12. It can be identified that the impedance spectra were consisted of two parts, the semicircles part in the high-medium frequency and the linear part in low frequency. The semicircle represented the charge transfer resistance (Rct) which is related to dual-effect of the interface between electrode and electrolyte and the (Re) represented the electrolyte resistance meanwhile the linear part in low frequency region reflected the Warburg impedance (W) which is associated with the diffusion of Li ion in electrode [48]. The equivalent circuit parameters (Re, Rct and W) after the 50th cycle are also listed as shown in Table 2 for the samples severally. From the result of the 1st cycle, the Co3O4 coated LiMn2O4 exhibited slightly larger film resistance (Rf) than the bare LiMn2O4. This result can be attributed to the combination of the SEI film and Co3O4 coating layer formed on the surface of the Co3O4-coated electrode [49,42]. It was observed from Table 2 that a great reduction of Warburg impedance on LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 and 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 samples over pristine LiMn2O4 was for the reason of facilitates diffusion of Liþ to electrode materials and the Warburg impedance inversely related to the Liþ diffusion [45]. The 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 showed a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) value compared to pure LiMn2O4 from and there was an increase of (W) value of the pure LiMn2O4 more sharply than that of the 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 which changes from 55.8U to 166.4U with cycle in Fig. 12. The calculated resistances of 2 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 sample are the smallest in comparison with others, which indicates the Ni doping and Co3O4 coating can reduce the bulk resistance and the charge transfer resistance, improving their electrochemical kinetics and resulting in the enhanced high rate performance. Such results was well corroborated with the impedance growth rate and the impedance growth of pristine LiMn2O4 which was relatively faster than the dopedcoating samples, indicating that Ni dope and Co3O4 coating layer would stable the crystal structure of LiMn2O4 material and decrease the dissolution of Mn4þ which leads to more admirable electrochemical performance. It can be seen that the AC impendence results were anastomotic with the above electrochemical test results of all the samples. 4. Conclusions The Ni doping and Co3O4 coated spinel LiMn2O4 composites were successfully synthesized via a sol-gel combine with thermal decomposition method. can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of the LiMn2O4 materials. This highly crystalized and Co3O4 coated structure is beneficial to the compaction density and minimized the exposed area of the electrode to the electrolyte and thus decreased Mn2þ dissolution during the process. The 2.0 wt% Co3O4-coated LiNi0.03Mn1.97O4 exhibited the good cycle performance both at room temperature and high temperature. As a universal sol-gel assisted synthesis method, it may also find application in the preparation of other coating layer materials. This convenient and successful strategy proposed in this study demonstrates a promising application in enhancing the performance of lithium manganite for lithium ion batteries.

The phase evolution was studied as a function of the cobalt substitution and the modification on the intercalation and deintercalation of Li ions. Characterization methods include TG-DTA, XRD, SEM, Raman, FTIR, and SQUID. LiMn2−yCoyO4 samples crystallize with the cubic spinel-like structure (Fd3m S.G.). Raman scattering and FT-infrared spectroscopy indicate that the vibrational mode frequencies and relative intensities of the bands are sensitive to the covalency of the (Co, Mn)–O bonds. MEB micrographs show that the particle dimension of the LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders ranges in the sub-micron-sized domain with a narrow grain-size distribution. The overall electrochemical capacity of LiMn2−yCoyO4 oxides have been reduced due to the 3d6 metal substitution. However, a more stable charge–discharge cycling performances has been observed when the electrodes are charged up to 4.3 V as compared to the performance of the native oxide. For such a cut-off voltage, the charge capacity of the Li//LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 cell is ca. 101 mA h/g.

Keywords: Lithium batteries; Co substituted spinels; Lithium insertion; Local structure 1. Introduction Lithium-ion batteries using transition-metal oxides as positive electrodes are currently dominating the portable power sources industry for laptop computers and mobile telephones. The great success of Li-ion type cells has stimulated studies on high-performance for alternative positive electrodes such as LiMn2O4, but the electrochemical properties of spinel LiMn2O4 are highly dependent on the synthesis route, composition, and thermal history of the samples [1]. Its LiMn2−yMyO4 (M = Ni, Co, Al, Cr, Fe, etc.) derivatives exhibiting a high-operating voltage of ca. 4 V are grown by numerous synthesis methods with substitution on the transition-metal site [2,3]. However, LiMn2O4 powders synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction method shows that the capacity of the 4 V region decreases with increasing annealing temperature above 800 ◦C [4]. This was attributed to either the larger particle size or to ∗Corresponding author. Tel.: +33 144274561; fax: +33 144273882. E-mail address: Christian.Julien@insp.jussieu.fr (C.M. Julien). the deviation from stoichiometry at high synthesis temperatures. In recent years, several wet-chemical techniques including low-temperature preparation such as co-precipitation, sol–gel, and Pechini processes have been successfully developed [5–7]. There are several advantages in using a wet-chemical method to synthesize LiMn2O4 powders: (1) all experiment procedures can be carried out in air, (2) the use of aqueous solution results in an intimate mixture of cations at the molecular level, (3) the synthesis makes an easy control in the ratio of lithium to manganese at low temperatures, and (4) the use of organic-acid gel is particularly attractive for high specific area of obtained powders. The partial substitution of metal cations for the Mn forming the LiMn2−yMyO4 solid solutions (with M = monovalent or multivalent cation) is a strategy to improve significantly the electrochemical cycling of LiMn2O4 materials, but at the expense of a decrease in initial capacity within the useful voltage window, i.e. below 4.4 V. Such a successful result is due to the replacement of the Mn3+ Jahn-Teller (JT) ions, which provoke a tetragonal phase transition in the 3 V region [8,9]. Several other origins have been discussed for the reduction of capacity loss 0921-5107/$ – see front matter © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.mseb.2005.12.031 N.

Despitethedecreasingfirstdischargecapacityuponsubstitution, cobalt-doped spinels seem to be the most promising substituted materials investigated so far [9–21]. Several works on the structure and electrochemistry of LiMn2−yMyO4 oxides prepared by wet-chemistry have been previously reported for cobalt substitution [11–16]. Kawai et al. demonstrated the existence of the LiMn2O4–LiCo2O4 solid solution of general formula Li2Co1+zMn3−zO8 in the range −1 ≤z ≤+1 [10,11]. Two main effects appear with the presence of Co in LiMn2O4: (1) an enhancement of the exchange current density and (2) an easy charge-transfer reaction of the active material [9]. Single-phase oxides were prepared by lactate [11] and oxalate [13] precursor method, while the LiCo1/6Mn11/6O4 was formed using high-temperature solid-state reaction [14]. Workers have shown that cyclic voltammograms and charge–discharge profiles of the Cosubstituted compounds have indicated a structural stabilization associated with an improvement of capacity retention. Fig. 1 shows the phase diagram of the spinel solid solutions Li2Co1+zMn3−zO8 and Li2−2yCo1+3yMn3−yO8 (thick lines) in the system Li–Co–Mn–O. Oxygen contents are not specified [10]. In this contribution, we present the characterization and electrode behaviour of LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) prepared by wetchemistry via the citrate and amino-acetate precursor routes. We study the phase evolution as a function of the cobalt substitution and the modification on the intercalation and deintercalation of Li ions. Characterization methods include X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry analysis (TG-DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman scattering (RS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. The electrochemical charge–discharge profiles of Li//LiMn2−yCoyO4 (y = 0.2) cells are investigated when electrodes are cycled in the potential range of 2.5–4.3 V. Differences andsimilaritiesbetweenLiMn2O4 andCo-substitutedoxidesare discussed there from. 2. Experimental Undoped LiMn2O4 and LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) powders were prepared with the same technique, i.e. the carboxylic acid-assisted wet-chemistry, from metal acetates via inorganic polymerization reactions in solution according to the method reported by Julien et al. [22,23]. In this work, both citric and succinic acid were used to compare the final products. These dicarboxylic acids play the role of chelating agent during the synthesis. Stoichiometric amounts of acetate hydrates of Li, Mn, and Co (Fluka, purum p.a. grade) were dissolved in triple distilled water and mixed well with an aqueous solution of either citric or succinic acid (Fluka, MicroSelect grade). TG-DTA curves of the gel precursors were obtained using a thermogravimetric analyzer (model Netzsch STA 409) at the heating rate of 0.1 ◦C s−1 under oxygen flow. The powder XRD patterns have been obtained on a Philips X’Pert PRO MRD (PW3050) diffractometer equipped with a Cu anticathode (Cu K radiation λ = 1.54056 ̊A) at room temperature. The measurements have been recorded under Bragg-Brentano geometry at 2θ with step 0.05◦in the range of 10–80◦. The XRD data were analysed by the Rietveld profile refinements using the Fullprof program. The particle morphology of the Li(Mn, Co)2O4 powders was examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips XL30). The FTIR absorption spectra were recorded with a Fourier transform interferometer (model Bruker IFS113v) in the wavenumber range of 120–1200 cm−1 at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. Samples were ground to fine powders and dispersed into ICs pellet. RS spectra were collected with a Raman-laser spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon model U1000) equipped of holographic grating double-monochromator coupled with a spatial filter. Powders were pellized to form mirror-like surface illuminated with the 514.5 nm emission from an Ar-ion laser (model Spectra-Physics 2020). Each RS spectrum was the average of 10 scans collected at a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1. Magnetic measurements were performed in a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer. Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetic susceptibility data were obtained in a field at 1 T in the temperature range of 4 ≤T ≤300 K. Electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature following the experimental procedure previously described using Teflon laboratory-cell hardware and Mac-Pile system [22]. Quasi open-circuit voltage curves were recorded using current pulse of 0.14 mA/cm2 applied for 1 h followed by a relaxation period of 0.5–1.0 h, which allows to record the 66 N.

Results and discussion 3.1. Synthesis and thermal analysis Single-phase LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders were synthesized after further heating of the fluffy brownish black precursors to 400–700 ◦C in air for 48 h. Both citric and succinic acid acted as fuels due to the presence of carboxylic COOH groups in these complexion agents. They provided decomposition of the metal complexes at low temperature, and yielded the impurity-free LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders when heated above 400 ◦C.

The weak endothermic effect associated with a weight loss of about 10% for T < 250 ◦C are attributed to departure of residual water. After the departure of the remaining water molecule at 300 ◦C, a strong exothermic peak appears at ca. 300 ◦C for citrate (350 ◦C for succinate) that corresponds to the decomposition of citric acid and acetate ions xerogel. A weight loss of 65.4% occurs during this stage because of the oxidation–decomposition reaction. It appeared that citric acid acts as a fuel in the pyrolysis of the gel precursor, favouring Fig. 2. Thermal analysis of LiMn1.6Co0.4O4 samples synthesized by sol–gel method (a) from citrate route and (b) from succinate route. the decomposition of acetate ions. It was reported that chelating agent (carboxylic-based acid) provokes decomposition during the synthesis of oxide powders [22,23]. The gel precursor was burning because the decomposed acetate ions acted as an oxidizer. Three steps in weight loss at 200–350 ◦C observed for the succinate route are associated to a more complex decomposition of the remaining organic constituents. Even though the crystallization starts around 400 ◦C; thus well-crystallized and single LiMn2−yCoyO4 phases have been obtained at 600 ◦C. XRD studies after the last effect indicate that very intimately mixedlithium–cobalt–manganeseoxidesreactedtogether.Thus, the impurity-free LiMn2−yCoyO4 oxide has been formed with a spinel structure described in the following. The thermogravimetric results also showed that the exothermic temperature, Texo, attributed to the decomposition–oxidation reaction of the precursor mass increases with addition of cobalt content in LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders. 3.2. Structure and morphology The XRD patterns of LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) oxides synthesized by sol–gel method from citrate precursors are shown in Fig. 3. Similar results have been obtained using the precipitation method from succinate precursors (see Fig. 4). These data show that all of the compounds are single phase when obtained through a careful selection of precursors. As the substitution of Co3+ for Mn3+ ions occurs in the LiMn2O4 spinel structure, a solid solution of lithium cobaltate and lithium manganate is obtained for the LiMn2−yCoyO2 materials up to y = 1. Fig. 4 shows the portions of XRD patterns (in the 2θ range from 50 to 75◦) from LiMn2−yCoyO4 for 0 ≤y ≤1 illustrating the lattice parameter shift in the solid solution. As the cobalt content increases a broadening of the diffraction peaks is observed. The XRD patterns of the samples synthesized Fig. 3.

X-ray diffraction patterns from LiMn2−yCoyO4 for 0 ≤y ≤1 powders synthesized by the precipitation method from succinate precursors. Limited range (in the 2θ range from 50 to 75◦) is shown illustrating the interplanar shifts as the Co content increases the spinel framework. for this study were indexed in the cubic Fd3m space group. As compared with that of LiMn2O4, the lattice parameters of LiMn2−yCoyO4 decreased with increasing Co content. The (4 4 0) Bragg line and those in the interval 56 ≤2θ ≤72◦display a slight displacement due to the decrease of the lattice parameter. Previous studies have determined the crystal chemistry of LiMn2−yCoyO4 oxides. They crystallize in the normal spinel structure of general formula A[B]O4. In the spinel structure, lithium (A) ions are located at the tetrahedral 8a sites (Wyckoff notation) and manganese (B) ions are distributed at octahedral 16d sites, while oxygen anions are located at the 32e sites with the oxygen positional parameter, u = 0.265. Thus, the 3-D structure of LiMn2−yCoyO4 is formed by (Mn, Co)O6 octahedra and LiO4 octahedra. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy [24], XANES [11], EPR [25], magnetic susceptibility measurements [26], and Mn, Co-L-edge XAS and XES spectroscopy [27], it was found that the charge distribution corresponds to Li[Coy3+Mn4+Mn1−y3+]O4 where Co3+ substitutes for Mn3+ in the normal LiMn2O4 spinel. Replacing Mn3+ with Co3+ (the former is a Jahn-Teller ion while the later is not) minimizes the electrostatic repulsion between the cations occupying 16d octahedral sites of the spinel framework. Despite the great difference in size between Mn3+ (ionic radius 0.78 ̊A for a coordination number of 6) and Co3+ (0.68 ̊A) the favourable stabilizing effect of Co-substitution on the spinel structure accounts for electrochemical improvement upon extended cycles. However, our XRDstructureprofilerefinementssuggestthatCoreplacesMn3+ in the 16d octahedral site, since we do not observe the appearance of a strong (2 2 0) Bragg line (at ca. 2θ = 30◦), which is extremely sensitive to the occupancy of the 8a tetrahedral site of the spinel lattice. Fig. 5a and b shows the composition dependence of the lattice parameters of LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) powders synthesized by the sol–gel method from citrate and succinate preFig. 5. The lattice parameter of the cubic structure, Fd3m space group, as a function of Co substitution for LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) powders synthesized from (a) citrate and (b) succinate precursors. cursors, respectively. The cubic parameters calculated via a least-squares refinement method using 14 well-defined XRD lines are a = 8.061 (2) and a = 8.043 (0) ̊A for y(Co) = 1, respectively. For these materials the spinel structure is well preserved upon considerable cobalt substitution (y = 1). As shown in Fig. 5, the replacement of Mn by Co results in a decrease of the cubic parameter; the a-axis shrinks due to the smaller ionic radius of CoIII (74 pm) cations, concordant with Co3+ substitution for Mn3+ and consistent with the results of previous workers [10–23]. It is interesting to remark that the lattice parameter variations are very similar for the different dopants. For LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders, a microscopic strain in the unit cell due to mismatch of Co3+ for Mn3+ ions induces the broadening of Bragg peaks (Fig. 4). Note that the cubic parameter for LiMnCoO4 synthesized via succinate is slightly smaller than for citrate route. The variation in the cubic parameter follows an almost Vegard’s law. In general, several factors can contribute to the broadening of peaks in X-ray diffraction [28,29]. For example, the instrumental factors related to the resolution and the incident X-ray wavelength as well as the sample factors such as crystallite size and non-uniform microstrain can cause a line broadening. In the case of an instrumental broadening, the line width will vary smoothly with 2θ or d spacing. On the other hand, the line broadening originating from the sample characteristics will have a different relationship. By combining the Scherrer’s equation for crystallite size and the Bragg’s law for diffraction, crystallite size and microstrain components are estimated by using the fol68 N. Amdouni et al. / Materials Science and Engineering B 129 (2006) 64–75 lowing equation: B2 cos2 θ = 16⟨e2⟩sin2 θ + K2λ2 L2 , (1) where B is the full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) after correction of the instrumental broadening for finely powdered silicon powder, θ is the diffraction angle, ⟨e2⟩denotes local strains (defined as d/d being the interplanar spacing), L is the crystallite size, and K is a near-unity constant related to crystallite shape. In Fig. 6 plots for three different reflections for the LiMn2−yCoyO4 (y = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0) are presented. The slope, 16⟨e2⟩, and intercept K2λ2/L2, were used to estimate the distortion and size parameters. Apparently, the integral breadth of Bragg lines of the y = 1.0 spinel is slightly greater than those of y =0.2 and 0.6 samples, which suggests a smaller grain size and a higher microstrain content (see Table 1). Surface morphology and texture as well as particle sizes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 7 shows the typical SEM pictures from LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders synthesized by the wet-chemical method from citrate precursors. The powders observed by SEM were found to be submicronsized particles, i.e. the grain size average is about 200 nm for LiMnCoO4. The crystallite sizes tended to increase as the sintering time increased, and ranged in size from 100 to 500 nm, suggesting the formation of submicrometre-sized particles with a narrow grain size distribution. The mild conditions used in the Fig. 6. Plot of B2 cos2 θ vs. sin2 θ for Bragg lines (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), and (5 3 1) of LiMn2−yCoyO4 (y = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0) samples. synthesis of the LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinels explain the small crystallite size that ranges from 200 to 380 nm. These observations are in accordance with the determination made from XRD data (Table 1). 3.3. Vibrational properties The LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders annealed at 550 ◦C were also characterized by means of vibrational spectroscopy to determine Fig. 7. Scanning electron micrographs of LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders synthesized by the wet-chemical citrate route for (a) y = 0.0, (b) y = 0.4, (c) y = 0.6, and (d) y = 1.0.

Fig. 8 shows the room temperature RS spectrum of undoped LiMn2O4 and those of the synthesized LiMn2−yCoyO4 samples annealed at 700 ◦C for 48 h with y = 0.1 and 0.3. As reported before, the RS spectrum of LiMn2O4 is dominated by a strong and broad band at ca. 625 cm−1 with a shoulder at 580 cm−1. A band with a medium intensity appears at ca. 483 cm−1, while three weak bands are observed at ca. 426, 382, and 300 cm−1 [30–32]. RS spectra of LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders are similar to their LiMn2O4 counterpart with some additional features. The cubic spinel possesses the Oh7 spectroscopic symmetry. Analysis of the vibrational spectra of LiMn2O4 yields nine optic modes [33]. Five modes are Raman active (A1g + Eg + 3F2g) and four are infrared active (F1u). It is also convenient to analyze these spectra in terms of localized vibrations, considering the spinel structure built of MnO6 octahedra and LiO4 tetrahedra. For LiMn1.2Co0.8O4, the Raman band located at ca. 639 cm−1 can be viewed as the symmetric Mn–O stretching vibration of MnO6 groups. This band is assigned to the A1g symmetry in the Oh7 spectroscopic space group. Its broadening is related with Fig. 8. Raman scattering spectra of LiMn2−yCoyO4 (for y = 0.0, 0.2, and 0.8) oxide powders synthesized by the sol–gel method from citrate precursors fired at 700 ◦C in air for 48 h. Vertical lines visualize the position of the bands identified as intrinsic modes for the LiMn2O4 spinel. the cation–anion bond lengths and polyhedral distortion occurring in LiMn2−yCoyO4. The intensity of the shoulder located at 580 cm−1 is strongly enhanced upon cobalt substitution. Two components are observed at 588 and 560 cm−1. This may be due to the change of Mn3+ and Mn4+ proportion versus Co in the material. The RS peaks located at 369 and 475 cm−1 have the F2g symmetry. One can state that in the ideal cubic spinel LiMn2O4, the Mn3+ and Mn4+ cations are considered as crystallographically equivalent (16d sites) in agreement with XRD data. Then, occupationprobabilitiesof0.5mustbeaffectedforeachcationin 16d site. Hence, a loss of translation invariance certainly occurs in LiMn2−yCoyO4, due to local lattice distortion around the different Mn3+ and Mn4+ cations. As a result, a breakdown in the Raman selection rules is expected, which explains the observation of broad bands (disordering in the Mn/Co sublattice) and the fact that more modes than expected are observed in cubic LiMn1.2Co0.8O4. Fig. 9 shows the FTIR spectra of LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinel materials at various levels of Co substitution (0 ≤y ≤1). Upon Co substitution, the vibrational modes observed in the far-infrared region appear quite stable. The systematic change in frequency of the high-wavenumber IR bands as a function of Co doping is not surprising, while a blue shift is expected with the increase of Co content due to the shortening of M–O bonds (Fig. 10). The intensity of the stretching mode (F1u symmetry) located at 558 cm−1 increases significantly for y(Co) = 1, which compares with the shape of the IR feature at 510–570 cm−1 for LiMn2O4. These results show that the local environment of lithium ions surrounded by oxygen anions is not strongly affected and the Fig. 9.

Composition dependence of the frequency of IR modes observed in Fig. 9. Wavenumbers were determined from a fit using Gaussian shape of the bands. covalency of MnO6 units increased slightly with doping. For high level of Co substitution, the broadening of the infrared peaks can be interpreted as an increase in MnO6 distortion due to the incorporation of Co3+ ions in the MO6 octahedra. However, because the stability of the LiO4 stretch, we can conclude that Co3+ cations were not incorporated on the Li sites of the interlayer space. Two new IR bands noted ν3 and ν4 appear with increasing Co content. They are located at ca. 440 and 610 cm−1. These new modes are assigned to the bending and stretching of Co–O bonds, respectively. 3.4. Electronic properties Fig. 11 displays the Arrhenius plots of the σT of LiMn2−yCoyO4 compounds where σ is the electrical conducFig. 11. Plot of σT vs. reciprocal temperature for LiMn2O4 and Co-substituted LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinels synthesized from citrate precursors. tivity. These graphs show that over the compositional range 0.0 ≤y ≤0.6 the conductivity is thermally activated owing to the semiconductingcharacteroftheseoxides.Theelectricalconductivity varies from 10−8 to 10−2 S/cm in the temperature range from 220 to 450 K. Examination of the data (Fig. 11) indicates that (i) the electrical conductivity is sensitive to the introduction of Co3+(3d6) ions in the host lattice, (ii) a noticeable change in the activation energy is observed in the high-temperature region, (iii) the temperature dependence of σdc deviates markedly from the exponential law—a curvature appears in the Arrhenius plots, and (iv) the phase transition nearby ambient temperature disappears for Co-doped LiMn2O4. The room temperature electrical conductivity increases by one order of magnitude from 10−5 S/cm for LiMn2O4 to 10−4 S/cm for LiMn1.4Co0.6O4. According to the electronic considerations discussed by Goodenough et al. [34], the small-polaron semiconducting character of the Li[Mn3+Mn4+]O4 compound is due to weak Mn–Mn interactions, which prevents an itinerant-electron bandwidth, hence localized electronic configurations. Considering the model of small-polaron transport suggested by Austin and Mott [35], the d.c. conductivity should be given by: σh = AC(1 −C) T exp  −2αR −W kBT  , (2) where A is a constant, C is the concentration of one type of cation, R is the average interionic separation, α−1 is the radius of the localized wavefunction (usually ≈10 ̊A in transition metal oxides), W is the activation energy, T is the absolute temperature, and kB is the Boltzman constant. For the undoped LiMn2O4 spinel, the room temperature conductivity is ca. 10−5 S/cm and the activation energy is 0.161 eV. These values are typical of small-polaron conduction in a mixed-valent system. In fact, the LiMn2O4 material imposes equal quantity of Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions per formula unit, which allows for easy transfer of electrons via hopping. The Co substitution increases the average valency of the manganese ions from Mn3.50+ for cubic structure LiMn2O4 to Mn3.71+ for the LiMn1.4Co0.6O4 phase. Thus the electrical conductivity of lithium manganese oxides with the spinel structure depends strongly on the cationic valence state and their distribution among the crystallographic positions in the framework. Enhancement of the electrical conductivity originates from three factors: (1) the increase of carrier concentration due to the change in the average valency ZMn (Table 1), (2) the decrease of the M–O distances in the structure which reduces the average interionic separation, and (3) the decrease of the activation energy due to the slight modification of the electronic band structure upon Co substitution. In addition, we observed the disappearance of the phase transition, which occurs nearby room temperature in undoped LiMn2O4. This first-order phase transition has been attributed to a cooperative effect of the Jahn-Teller Mn3+ ions [36,37]. The distortion is suppressed by cobalt substitution due to an increase of the average Mn valency. A loss of translation invariance certainly occurs, due to local lattice distortions around the different Mn3+ and Mn4+ cations. N.

Solid lines visualize the linear plot of the Curie–Weiss law of the paramagnetic region. 3.5. Magnetic properties Fig. 12 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) samples. In the low-temperature region, a drastic change in magnetization is observed upon substitution of Co for Mn. In particular, the strong anomaly at T = 30 K disappears progressively with the introduction of Co3+ in the spinel lattice. This is a consequence of the disappearance of the Mn3+ ions in the [Mn2]O4 sublattice. For LiCoMnO4, Mn4+ are the only paramagnetic species if we assume that low-spin Co3+ ions are diamagnetic species as confirmed below. In the entire temperature range (5–300 K), the sample y = 1.0 follows a paramagnetic behavior.

The Curie constant and Weiss temperature for LiMn2−yCoyO4 compounds are reported in Table 2. The effective magnetic moment number of LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinels is obtained from the sum of the magnetic susceptibility of each magnetic ion, as follows: p2 eff = p2 Mn4+ + (1 −y)p2 Mn3+ + yp2 Co3+, (4) where, pMn4+, pMn3+, and pCo3+ are the spin-only paramagnetic moment numbers of Mn4+, Mn3+, and Co3+, respectively. Spinonly numbers are calculated in the case of quenched angular momentum using p = 2[S(S + 1)]1/2 where S is the spin quantum number. The theoretical values of the Curie constant (Table 2) were calculated using the spin-only values of μeff = 3.87μB (S = 3/2) and 4.90μB (S = 2) for magnetic moments of Mn4+ and Mn3+, respectively [38].

The quasi-open voltage curves were obtained by GITT method with current density 0.14 mA/cm2 (C/20 rate). The very large negative Weiss temperature θp = −260 K for LiMnO4 decreases to θp = −20 K for LiMnCoO4 indicating a weaker antiferromagnetic interactions. Hence, it appears that Mn4+ in a [Mn4+Co3+] environment is a stable configuration at low temperature. This observation suggests that the cobalt ions themselves must impart a larger electron spin density through the metal–oxygen–lithium bond in addition to the increasing presence of Mn4+. Fig. 13 shows the composition dependence of the Weiss temperature, θp, and the Curie constant, Cp, for LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinel. Data were obtained from the linear fits of the paramagnetic behavior in Fig. 12. Solid line in Fig. 12 represents the theoretical curve using Eqs. (4) and (5) using a low-spin Co3+ (S = 0). We observe a good agreement between theoretical and experimental values showing that, as expected, the Co3+ ions are in the low-spin configuration. 3.6. Electrochemical properties The electrochemical features of synthesized spinel LiMn2−y CoyO4 were examined using Li//LiMn2−yCoyO4 cells submitted to constant current cycling, i.e. under galvanostatic conditions at 22 ◦C. The results from the electrochemical Li//LiMn2O4 cell are presented in Fig. 14a. The cells were charged and discharged at current densities of 0.14 mA/cm2 or 16 mA/g, while the voltTable 3 Electrochemical properties of LiMn2−yCoyO4 phases synthesized by wetchemistry from citrate (c) and succinate (s) precursors Material Theoretical capacity (mA h/g) x Practical capacitya (mA h/g) Efficiency (%) LiMn2O4 125 0.85 110 83 LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 (c) 123 0.80 101 82 LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 (s) 123 0.80 98 80 The theoretical capacity is based on the mass of the fully oxidized composition at 4.3 V. a For the first discharge process. age is monitored between 3.0 and 4.4 V. In this potential domain, the charge–discharge curves of materials synthesized by wetchemistry correspond to the voltage profiles characteristic of the LiMn2O4 ceramic material associated with lithium occupancy of tetrahedral sites. From the variation of the cell potential for the complete cell (Fig. 14a), one can see the presence of two regions during the lithium insertion–extraction processes. The shape of the voltage curves indicates whether the delithiated Li1−xMn2O4 exists as a multiple-phase system. The first region (I) is characterized by an S-shaped voltage curve, whereas the second region (II) corresponds to a plateau portion. In region I, the charge voltage increases continuously in the voltage range of 3.80–4.05 V. In region II, the charge voltage is stable around 4.15 V. However, electrode materials prepared from the citrate route provide a higher capacity (101 mA h/g) than oxides synthesized by the co-precipitation technique (97 mA h/g). This slight difference is attributed to the powder morphology (Table 3). For the Li//LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 cell (Fig. 14b), the upper 4 V plateau provides over 98 mA h/g based on the active material utilisation with an excellent cyclability. It is obvious that the initial capacity is decreased with increasing the Co content. This is due to the decreasing amount of Mn3+ ions in the substituted spinel phase since during the intercalation–deintercalation of Li+ in LiMn2O4 only the amount of Mn3+ contributes to the charge capacity. Charge and discharge tests for both citrate and succinate LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 show the better performance of the former electrode in terms of capacity retention. A unique pseudo one-phase is observed during charge–discharge process when electrodes are cycled in the voltage range of 2.8–4.4 V (Fig. 14b). The electrochemical stability has been attributed to the suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion caused by Mn3+ ions and to the stronger metal–oxygen bonding in substituted LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinel phases. In compound like LiMn2−yCoyO4, Mn would have an average oxidation number of 3.59, corresponding to a Mn3+:Mn4+ ratio of 41:59, which would make ratios smaller than 1 more probable in the final discharge stage. In LiMn1.8Co0.2O4, the Mn oxidation number is 3.53, which is close to the theoretical value for undoped spinel. This suggests that the electrochemical stability of this compound is less than the former one. The inverse derivative (−∂Q/∂V) plots versus cell voltage for LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 are shown in Fig. 15. This type of graph is very informative because plateaus in voltage versus capacity give rise to peaks in (−∂Q/∂V); so derivative plots are useful for displayN.

The two regimes of intercalation in LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 are clearly depicted when derivative voltage (−∂Q/∂V) is plotted versus cell voltage. A broad bands centered at 4.05 V (capacity around x = 0.7) is indicative of the one-phase system, while the narrow band at 4.15 V (capacity around 0.4) is indicative of the two-phase system. For the Li//LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 cell, the upper 4 V plateau provides over 100 mA h/g based on the active material utilisation with an excellent cyclability. Fig. 16 shows the discharge capacity versus cycle number for Li//LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 cells (citrate and succinate) compared with the native LiMn2O4 oxide. The Co-substituted products have been found to be excellent in terms of practical material utilisation. Obviously, the Co incorporation improves the cyclability of the Li//LiMn2−yCoyO4 cells. The substituted LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinel phases are more stable than LiMn2O4. For y = 0.2, the capacity fading is less than 5% at the 35th cycle for the electrode material synthesized from citrate precursor. From the comparison between electrodes prepared from different precursors, we can conclude that the better crystallinity, the finer and Fig. 16.

Squares are experimental data measured during the discharge. Fits were made using Eq. (6). more homogeneous particles of LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 by the sol–gel method, compared with those by the coprecipitation method, are considered to lead to larger discharge capacities. The improvement of the cyclability observed for LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 seems to be related to the stronger M–O bonds in the [M2]O4 sublattice. This can be attributed to the higher ligand field stabilization energy of the Co3+(t6 2ge0 g) compared to the Mn3+(t3 2ge1 g) ions [39]. The determination of the chemical diffusion coefficients of lithiumionsinpositiveelectrodeswasdonebytheGITTmethod. This technique consists of a series of current steps separated by a relaxation period. For short times and small current pulses, the solution of the infinite diffusion problem, based on the early work of Weppner and Huggins [40], leads to a simple expression for the chemical diffusivity, D∗ Li, of lithium ions if the pulse duration, t, is smaller than the characteristic time τ = L2/D∗ Li: D∗ Li = 4 πt mVm MS 2Es Et 2 (5) where S is the surface area, and Et and Es are the voltage changes during the current pulse and after the current pulse, respectively. m, M, and Vm are the mass, molecular weight, and partial molar volume of the host oxide, respectively. The high insertion capability has been confirmed also by measuring the chemical diffusion coefficients of Li+ ions in LixMn1−yCoyO2 materials. Fig. 17 shows the evolution of the chemical diffusion coefficient D∗ Li of Li+ ions in LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 sample synthesized by the wet-chemical citrate route. D∗ Li are in the vicinity of 10−10–10−11 cm2/s during the discharge of the Li//LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 cell. If we consider that the diffusion of Li ions into the host matrix has two limiting factors, the ion hopping probability and the degree of site occupancy, then the chemical diffusion coefficient can be expressed as: D∗ Li = αW[(xm −x)2 + β(xm −x)], (6) where xm is the full site occupancy for Li ions, α is the factor related with the probability for ion hopping, and β represents 74 N. Amdouni et al. / Materials Science and Engineering B 129 (2006) 64–75 Fig. 18. Evolution of the chemical diffusion coefficient D∗ Li of Li+ ions in LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders synthesized by the wet-chemical citrate route. Squares and circles are experimental data measured at mid-discharge and end of charge, respectively. Fits were made using Eq. (7). an interaction factor [41]. Lines in Fig. 17 are the curves calculated from Eq. (6) giving parameters α = 1.1 × 10−11 cm2/s and β = 5.8 for LiMn1.8Co0.2O4. These features reflecting the relatively facile extraction process for Li ions in the LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 spinel structure synthesized by the wet-chemical technique are in good accordance with SEM and XRD data. It is necessary to obtain sub-micrometer particles of uniform morphology with narrow size distribution and homogeneity in order to achieve the reliability of the lithium batteries. Fig. 18 shows the evolution of the chemical diffusion coefficient D∗ Li of Li+ ions as a function of the Co content in LiMn2−yCoyO4 powders synthesized by the wet-chemical citrate route. Squares and circles are experimental data measured at mid-discharge and at the end of charge, respectively. Fits were made using a simple polynomial equation as follows: D∗ Li = D0 + αy + βy2, (7) where D0 is in the range of 3–5 × 10−11 cm2/s. Data shown in Fig. 18 exhibit an increase up to y = 0.4 and then decrease considerably in the range of 6–1 × 10−11 cm2/s. Based on the crystal structure of LiMn2−yCoyO4 spinel phases, the intercalation process is partly controlled by the number of Li+ ion occupancies in the host lattice (geometrical factor) but also by the number of redox species (Mn3+/Mn4+). The cobalt substitution also provides an increase of chemical diffusion coefficients of Li ions in the LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 lattice. 4. Conclusion In this work, we have studied the structural, physical, and electrochemical properties of Co-substituted LiMn2−yCoyO4 (0 ≤y ≤1) positive electrode materials synthesized by a sol–gel method from citrate and succinate precursors. X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman scattering, FTIR, and magnetic measurements have shown that single-phase impurity free can be made through careful selection of precursors. Vibrational spectroscopies have shown that, for moderate Co substitution, the local octahedral environment of Li ions in LiMn2−yCoyO4 is almost similar to that in LiMn2O4. The voltage profiles of the layered substituted oxides monitored against lithium electrode show that the overall capacity of positive electrodes was reduced due to the 3d6-metal substitution. However, more stable charge–discharge cycling performances have been observed when electrodes are charged up to 4.3 V as compared to the performances of the native oxides. The rechargeability of the Li//LiMn2−yCoyO4 cells appears better than LiMn2O4 because the lack of high concentration of Mn3+ ions in the low-voltage region. The improvement of the cyclability observed for LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 seems to be also related to the stronger M–O bonds in the [M2]O4 sublattice. This can be attributed to the higher ligand field stabilization energy of the Co3+(t6 2ge0 g) compared to the Mn3+(t3 2ge1 g) ions. For the Li//LiMn1.8Co0.2O4 cell, the upper 4 V plateau provides over 101 mA h/g based on the active material utilisation with an excellent cyclability.

Our examination revealed that these crystals contain a large number of stacking faults and exhibit significant cation mixing in the transition-metal layers; the cation mixing becomes significant with an increase in the Ni concentration. Charge−discharge measurements showed that the replacement of Mn with Ni lowers the potential of the charge plateau and leads to higher charge−discharge capacities. From a topological point of view with regard to the atomic arrangement in the crystals, it is concluded that substituting Mn in Li2MnO3 with Ni promotes the formation of smooth Li percolation paths, thus increasing the number of active Li ions and improving the charge−discharge capacity. I n recent years, so-called Li-rich compounds Li2MO3 [Li(Li1/3M2/3)O2; M: transition metal (TM)] have been investigated for use as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries because they show specific capacities (200 mA h g−1) higher than those of LiMO2. Among the various Li2MO3 compounds being explored, Li2MnO3 has been examined particularly intensively.1−3 On the other hand, about a decade ago, Lu et al. investigated the structures and battery properties of Li[NixLi1/3−2x/3Mn2/3−x/3]O2 materials, which are solid solutions of Li(Li1/3Mn2/3)O2 [Li2MnO3], and Li(Ni1/2Mn1/2)O2, (1−2x: 2x; see Supporting Information, Figure S-1) and found that they show better electrochemical performances than does Li(Li1/3Mn2/3)O2, especially at x = 1/3 to 5/12.4 In addition to this study, other efforts have also been made to improve the performance of such Li-rich materials.5 Recently, the combined use of X-ray and neutron diffraction analyses allowed us to determine the structural parameters of such complex crystals with precision. In addition, to analyze the structural defects, the FAULTS program created by Casas-Cabanas6 et al. is helpful because it simultaneously allows for Rietveld refinement and stacking fault analysis based on DIFFaX.7 In this study, we prepared five Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) (x = 0, 1/20, 1/10, 1/6, and 1/4) specimens and scrutinized their structures as well as with their structural defects complementarily using a general Rietveld program, Z-Rietveld8 (for the joint analysis), and the FAULTS program (for the stacking fault analysis). The results of quantitative analysis for these five specimens are listed in Table S-I. It was assumed that the metal atomic sites (Li and TM layers in the Li2MnO3 structure; see below for structural details) are all filled with atoms, that is, they do not have any vacancies. We prepared the starting materials so as to form Li2(NixMn1−x)O3 pseudobinary compounds; however, as can be seen from Table S-I and Figure S-1, the resultant materials were formed away from the Li2MnO3− Li2NiO3 pseudobinary line. Figure 1 shows the first cycle charge−discharge profiles of the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) (x = 0, 1/20, 1/10, and 1/4) specimens. As can be seen in Figure 1, their specific capacities are not sufficiently high; however, the dependence of the specific capacity on the Ni composition is almost similar to that reported by Beaulieu4,9 et al., which is that replacing Mn with Ni lowers the potential of the charge plateau and leads to higher charge−discharge capacities. Figure 2 shows the synchrotron diffraction patterns obtained for the four Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) (x = 0, 1/10, 1/6, and 1/4) materials. The diffraction patterns are almost similar, suggesting Received: March 14, 2016 Accepted: May 16, 2016 Published: May 19, 2016 Letter pubs.acs.org/JPCL © 2016 American Chemical Society 2063 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00587 J.

Li2MnO3 is known, as shown in Figure S-2, to have a monoclinic structure (space group C2/m) consisting of three kinds of ABC-stacked atomic layers as well as the compounds LiMO2 (space group R3̅m)10 (M: transition metal). However, 33% of the atoms in the TM layer of Li2MnO3 are of Li and not of Mn, in contrast to the case for the LiMnO2 structure. The Li atoms in the TM layer occupy the 2b sites of C2/m; on the other hand, the remaining 67% Mn atoms are located at the 4g sites. These two kinds of atoms form an ordered arrangement in the TM plane (see Figure S-2). The structures were analyzed by the Z-Rietveld code for neutron−synchrotron joint analysis, in order to determine the precise atomic positions and site occupancies of Li, Mn, and Ni first, without considering the stacking faults. The structure refinement results are presented in Table S-II and Figure S-3. Almost all the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the calculated ones generated using single sets of the profile parameters (U, V, and W for the synchrotron diffractions and σ and γ for the neutron diffractions).8 This strongly indicated that the peaks of the synthesized samples were from a single phase of the monoclinic Li2MnO3 structure, that is, the structure of Li[Li0.2Mn0.6Ni0.2]O2 reported by Jarvis11 et al., who used the electron diffraction technique to conclude that this material is composed of a solid solution of Li2MnO3 and LiMO2 domains with C2/m monoclinic symmetry. During the analyses, no atomic mixing between the metal and oxygen layers was assumed; however, all possible metal-atom occupation (mixing) configurations among the 2c, 4h (both in the Li layer), 2b, and 4g (both in the TM layer) sites were examined, because it is known that the Li and Mn atoms at the 2b and 4g sites show a partially disordered atomic arrangement in Li2MnO3 (i.e., cation mixing in the TM layer).2,3,12 These examinations revealed that the Li layers are composed exclusively of Li atoms, whereas the TM layers comprise the atoms of the three metals (Li, Ni, and Mn), which are largely mixed among the 2b and 4g sites. As seen in Table 1, the Mn atoms prefer the 4g site; on the other hand, the Li and Ni atoms tend to selectively occupy the 2b site. This suggests that the 4g site tends to favor the higher-valence cations than does the 2b site. This cation mixing in the TM layers was also confirmed by high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)−scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations (Figure S-4). Next, we elucidated the stacking faults in the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) specimens. In the diffraction profiles, fairly intense diffuse peaks related to the stacking faults can be observed, especially at the bottom of the 020, 110, and 1̅11 reflections (see Figure 2). This result is similar to that reported for the Li2MnO3 crystal.2,3,11−13 The Li2MnO3 crystal is composed of periodic ABC stacking of three different atomic layers, namely, the TM, O, and Li layers, along the c-axis direction, as shown below (also see Figure S-2): Here, this type of layer stacking can be regarded as a structure consisting of ABC stacking of slabs formed by four Figure 1. First charge−discharge curves of Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) (x = 0, 1/20, 1/10, and 1/4) between 2.0 and 4.8 V (vs Li/Li+) at a rate of 10 mA g−1 as measured at room temperature. Figure 2. Synchrotron diffraction patterns of Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) (x = 0, 1/10, 1/6, and 1/4). The arrows indicate the positions of the 020, 110, 1̅11, 021, and 111 superstructure reflections. The insets show magnified images of the low-angle parts; fairly intense diffuse peaks from the stacking faults can be seen, especially at the bottoms of the 020, 110, and 1̅11 superstructure reflections (the background profiles are represented by the broken lines). These superstructure reflections appear to consist of diffuse peaks and sharp Bragg peaks, suggesting that the four Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) compounds were composed of two kinds of domains with different crystallinities. During the subsequent two-phase FAULTS analysis performed while taking these two kinds of domains into account, the observed and calculated profiles were in very good agreement with each other, as can be seen in Figure S6.

Phys. Chem. Lett. 2016, 7, 2063−2067 2064 -O-TM-O-Liatomic layers. Stacking faults are generated in such layered materials by the glide translation of the atomic planes in the a−b plane. Furthermore, the topologically possible stacking faults can be described fully using three different stacking vectors, [0, 0, 1], [1/2, −1/6, 1] (both as cubic-type stacking), and [1/6, −1/6, 1] (as a hexagonal-type stacking), in the monoclinic (C2/m) cell (see Figures S-5-1 and S-5-2) and by their combinations (multiplications). During the FAULTS Rietveld refinement process, it was assumed that the stacking faults were allowed only between the interslabs indicated by the arrows and were never generated within the slabs in ill. 1. The probabilities of translation from one slab to the next by these stacking vectors can be represented by the three α parameters, α11, α12, and α13. The parameter α11 is the probability for the normal cubic-type stacking found in the perfect Li2MnO3 crystal, whereas α12 is that for another cubictype stacking fault related to the ordered atomic arrangement in the TM layers. When α11 = 1, α12 = 0, and α13 = 0, this crystal has no stacking faults. If the TM layer has a completely disordered (random) atomic arrangement, there is no difference between α11 and α12 (see Figure S-5-2). As can be seen in the diffraction patterns (Figure 2), the superstructure reflections consist of sharp and diffuse peaks (see the inset profiles with the backgrounds), which demonstrates that these materials comprise two kinds of domains with different crystallinities. This can be attributed to the existence of highly ordered domains that have perfectly ordered atomic arrangements and no stacking faults as well as disordered domains with the atomic mixing and stacking faults mentioned above, as has been reported for Li2MnO3,2,3,11−13 Figure 3 shows that the compositional dependencies of parameters α11, α12, and α13 for the imperfect domains, as well as the fraction of perfect (/imperfect) domains as obtained by the FAULTS analysis (the Rietveld analysis results are also shown in Figure S-6). As can be seen in Figure 3a, the α13 parameters, which indicated the formation of hexagonal stacking faults, were almost zero; on the other hand, the cubic stacking faults generated by [1/2, −1/6, 1] (α12) were 20%. These stacking faults in the imperfect domains tended to decrease as the Ni concentration was increased; on the other hand, the fraction of the imperfect domains increased with the increase in the Ni concentration. The volume ratio of the perfect and imperfect domains is shown in Figure 3b. Because the defects in the specimen were diluted by the perfect domains, when applying this average correction to Figure 3a, we could obtain the modified α parameters, as shown in Figure 3c. As seen in this figure, the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) compounds contain a significant number of stacking faults; however, the average fraction of the stacking faults remains almost unchanged, irrespective of the Ni concentration. Finally, we show the relationship between the electrochemical behavior and the structural features of the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) specimens. Pure Li2MnO3 does not show any property, because manganese is only at a +4 state in this material. It is simply expected that, as soon as Ni is introduced in the material, redox can occur and electrochemical properties are improved. However, in the case of the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) crystals, it is essential that the Li ions in the TM layers are used as effectively as those in the Li layers, in order to ensure superior electrochemical performance; in other words, the Li ions need to smoothly migrate within as well as across the layers during the charging−discharging processes (see section 1 in the Supporting Information). In these crystals, every metal atom in the Li and TM layers has 12 metal (Li or Mn/Ni) atoms as the second nearest neighbors (see Figures S-2 and S-7). When the Li ions jump into the positions of their 12 neighboring metal atoms, they have to pass through the potential barrier formed by the six obstructing atoms (two O ions and four Li/Mn ions) located around each jumping axis (see Figures 4 and S-8). In a perfect crystal, when a conducting Li ion moves continuously to the neighboring Li positions, it necessarily encounters the potential barrier formed by the contribution of one or two Mn/Ni ions, as seen in Figures 4 and S-8, within two jumping steps. Of the Li, Mn, Ni, and O obstructing atoms, the Mn atoms make it the most difficult for the migrating Li atoms to slip through the barriers; this is because they are tetravalent Figure 3.

Lett. 2016, 7, 2063−2067 2065 cations (Mn4+), forming a significantly large Coulomb potential so as to cut offthe paths.14 Then, when these Mn4+ ions are replaced by low-valence cations such as Li+ or Ni2+, it is expected that the conducting Li ions can move to the neighboring positions more easily. The significant number of stacking faults and cation mixing in Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) can cause an exchange of the Mn4+/Ni2+ and Li+ positions in the TM layer. Figures 4 and S-8 show several of an enormous number of metal-atom chains in the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) crystals. When the transition metals on the chain in Figure 4 are replaced by Li atoms, this chain acts as a Li-percolation path; when the obstructing high-valence Mn4+ cations around the chains in Figures 4 and S-8 are replaced by low-valence cations (Li+ or Ni2+), these chains become smoother Li percolation paths. In the synthesized Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) specimens, as the Ni content was increased, the number of lower-valence Ni ions increased instead of the number of the higher-valence Mn ions. Furthermore, the degree of atomic mixing became more significant (see Table 1). These phenomena resulted in an increase in the number of longer and smoother percolation paths. It is, therefore, deemed that the replacement of Mn with Ni results in active Li ions and increases the charge−discharge capacity (see Figure 1). In other words, the idea of Lee14 et al. of facilitating smooth Li percolation is topologically realized in the Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) compounds, and we believe that the interchanging of the atomic positions of Li and Mn/Ni is one of the major reasons for the compounds exhibiting performances better than that of Li2MnO3 (also see section 2 in the Supporting Information). ■EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Li2(NixMn1−x)O3(−δ) (x = 0, 1/20, 1/10, 1/6, and 1/4) were synthesized by a solid-state reaction of LiOH·H2O, NiCO3, and MnCO3 at a molar ratio of 2.1: x: 1 −x as precursors. These starting materials were thoroughly mixed by milling in acetone for 2 h and then dried at 100 °C. The precursors were pelletized at 5 MPa and calcined at 450 °C for 24 h. They were powdered and pressed again to form new pellets, which were then annealed at 900 °C for 12 h in the air. The heating and cooling rates were both 300 °C h−1. A mixture of the active material, acetylene black (Denki Kagaku Kogyo), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Kureha) with a weight ratio of 80:10:10 was spread onto an aluminum foil with 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum overnight to constitute a positive electrode. The electrode was pressed to a typical thickness of 30−35 μm. Metallic lithium foil (0.2 mm in thickness, > 99.9%, Honjo Metal) was used as counter and reference electrodes. These components were assembled together with the s polyolefin separator and soaked in the electrolyte solution in an Ar-filled glovebox, which were sealed in an aluminum-coated laminate-type cell. The electrolyte used in this study was 1 M LiPF6, which was dissolved in anhydrous ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) with a volumetric ratio of 3:7 (Kishida Chemical).The electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature on an automatic cycling and data recording system (HJ1001SD8, Hokuto Denko). Synchrotron diffraction experiments were performed using a large-diameter Debye−Scherrer camera with an imaging plate on the BL02B2 beamline at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI/SPring-8).15 The neutron powder diffraction data were obtained using a time-of-flight powder diffractometer (BL09 beamline, SPICA) at the Japanese Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC).16 Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (for metals) and iodometric redox titration (for oxygen) analyses were used to determine the compositions of the synthesized products (Table S-I). ■ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00587.

This paper concerns the role that structural defects play in reducing the magnitude of JT distortion. Structural defects were induced in micrometric and nanometric LiMn2O4 using 60Co gamma radiation. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and magic angle spinning spectroscopy (7Li MAS NMR) were used to detect and investigate the defects created by 60Co gamma irradiation in micrometric and nanometric LiMn2O4. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the effect on the JT distortion enthalpy. Spectroscopic and microstructural modifications of LiMn2O4 produced by the action of radiation are shown for the first time. The results revealed that partial and total edge dislocations are generated after the oxides are irradiated. In the formed dislocations, manganese and lithium ions modified their surroundings and coordination, while the atomic positions of oxygen atoms changed in the fcc structure. These modifications gave rise to a decrease in the magnitude of JT distortion in the micrometric oxides, while no distortion was detected in the nanometric oxides. Because of the defects in LiMn2O4 caused by 60Co gamma irradiation, a minor distortion in the cell parameter (c/a) should be expected when this material is used as a cathode in lithium-ion batteries. 1. Introduction The storage of large quantities of energy in a reversible, safe and inexpensive manner is a necessity for the technological and societal development of mankind. Among the frequently studied cathodic materials for lithium secondary batteries, LiMn2O4 appears to be a promising candidate because of its low cost, low toxicity and compatibility with the environment [1, 2]. However, the moderate stability and low theoretical energy density (592 Wh/Kg) of the LiMn2O4 with respect to other competitive cathode materials as LiCoO2 (1037 Wh/Kg) and LiFePO4 (612 Wh/Kg) are weaknesses that need to be overcome for its application. The theoretical energy density of LiMn2O4 is reached when the lithium composition (x) in the general formula LixMn2O4 is between 0 and 1 (4 V zone). Unlike LiCoO2 and LiFePO4, the structure of LiMn2O4 allows it to exceed x = 1 and reach a value of x = 2 (3 V zone), where the stored density energy would theoretically be 1042 Wh/kg. This places this material in an advantageous position compared with its competitors. Transitioning from x = 1 to x = 2 remains a great challenge that requires much research [2–5], due to the presence of Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion [2]. This effect is responsible for the irreversible structural transition from the cubic to the tetrahedral phase. The JT effect considerably affects the reversibility of the insertion/deinsertion processes and creates high cell polarization even at low cycling current [1]. In addition, the JT effect produces strain between particles during the anisotropic transport of Li+ inside the material [2, 3]. Attempts have been made to reduce the JT effect; however, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssi.2018.06.007 Received 29 November 2017; Received in revised form 4 June 2018; Accepted 5 June 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author.

T strategies involving doping with elements such as Mg2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni3+, Al3+, and Li+ only achieved a stabilized structure, thus enhancing the number of charge-discharge cycles or increasing the average working voltage up to ~5 V [6, 7]. In highly Ni-doped spinel (LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4), it is possible to overcome JT distortion and as a consequence improve the specific capacity to ~160 mA·h/g [8]. In this context, the best strategy to reversibly cycle over the 4 V and 3 V zones is to use nanoparticles of LiMn2O4 [1, 2, 9, 10]. In that respect M. Okubo et al. [1] demonstrated that very good results can be obtained by using nanoparticles with sizes < 15 nm, because of the interphase between the cubic and tetragonal structures, which makes lithium-ion transport difficult, does not take place. This results because the small size of the nanocrystals avoids the long-range cooperative interaction responsible for decreasing the driving forces that give rise to this transition [1]. In addition the work of Y.J. Park et al. [3] showed that low crystalline films of LiMn2O4 with defects such as micropores, microvoids and vacancies considerably improve the reversible insertion of Li+ in all the composition range (0 < x < 2) [3, 5]. Bearing in mind the relation between the JT effect and reversibility in the insertion/deinsertion process, it is unusual that only a few papers can be found in the literature arguing the influence of particle size or defects on the JT distortion of LiMn2O4. The majority of these works relate the morphology or microstructural characteristics of these materials with the enhancement of the reversibility of the cycling process. In this way, the possible influence that structural and microstructural defects could have over the magnitude of the JT distortion is often obviated. Experimentally, it is possible to create a variety of structural and microstructural defects in lithium and manganese oxides by employing 60Co gamma radiation, which would help us understand the influence of such defects on JT distortion [14, 15]. However, only a few works have examined the effect of gamma radiation on LiMn2O4 [16]. The greatest efforts from the theoretical and experimental points of view have been addressed on the MgAl2O4 spinel type structure. Nevertheless, we can infer what will happen to LiMn2O4 upon irradiation, as these two oxides are isostructural and the ionic radius of Mg2+ (0.58 Å) and Li+ (0.59 Å), as well as Al3+ (0.53 Å) and Mn4+(0.53 Å), are quite similar. Several theoretical articles support the idea that the main point defects caused by irradiation in MgAl2O4 could be related to the exchange of the positions of Mg2+ and Al3+(cation anti-site defect) [11, 12] and although this fact is difficult to detect, some indirect results have been reported [13, 14]. Experimentally, a great amount of microstructural transformations in this oxide, such as dislocation loop punching, creation of amorphous tracks with typical diameters of a few nm, and atomic disordering, have been observed [15]. Therefore, the aim of this work is to show that structural, microstructural modifications, such as ionic shifts and dislocations, respectively, directly influence the magnitude of the JT distortion in LiMn2O4, and that these aspects are very important to consider when a larger energy storage range is desired. In this work, we address defective LiMn2O4 obtained by 60Co gamma irradiation of its micrometric and nanometric particles. This work consists of two main sections. The first section describes the most important defects generated as a consequence of 60Co gamma irradiation of this oxide. The second part of the work discusses how defects can influence JT distortion with the corresponding reduction in the magnitude of the JT enthalpy and how this could be related to the cubic-tetragonal structural transition. 2. Experimental 2.1. Synthesis and irradiation The micrometric LiMn2O4 was synthesized from a citrate precursor of manganese III and Lithium with a molar relation Li: Mn: Citrate 1:2:3 as was reported in [16]. This citrate precursor was placed in a platinum crucible and decomposed at 750 °C, in air, during 30 min. A portion of the resulted micrometric oxide was separated and irradiated with 60Co gamma rays in an irradiator model ISO-GAMMA LLCO at an irradiation rate of 4.874 kGy/h by periods of 12 h until a cumulative dose of 630 kGy was reached. Nanometric oxide was obtained from the same citrate precursor for the micrometric sample described above, but its thermal decomposition was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C/min at 350 °C over 40 min in air flux [16]. The as-prepared nanoparticles were irradiated at 100, 630, and 1000 kGy at the same irradiation rate as used for micrometric oxide. 2.2. Characterization X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-prepared irradiated and non-irradiated oxides were obtained with a Shimadzu XRD700 XRD diffractometer by using a Cu target submitted to 30 mA electronic radiation at a voltage of 40 kV. Measurements were carried out in a 2Ɵ range of 17–70° at a scan speed of 0.025°/s and a counting time of 4 s. A standard crystalline Si (CAS #: 7440-21-3, No ICSD: 27-1402) sample was used for instrument calibration. Cell parameter refinement was done according to the Le Bail method [17] with the aid of the FullProf [18] program. The data used to perform structural analysis by the Rietveld method were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using a Ge (111) Johansson monochromator and an X-ray wavelength of 1.5406 Å at room temperature. Overall, 2208 experimental points were acquired over the 2θ range. 7Li-RMN (MAS) spectra were obtained using Bruker 400 MHz equipment. 7LiCl (116.57 MHz) was used as a reference material to calibrate the chemical shifts. Measurements were performed using a holder with a diameter of 4 mm at a temperature of 25 °C. Magic angle gathering over 500 scans in every register with a radiofrequency pulse of π/2, width of 2.4 μs and relaxation time of 1 s was employed. Different rotation frequencies (10 and 13 KHz) were used to determine the position of the isotropic peak. The oxides were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOLJEM-2010 microscope with a LaB6 filament operating at 200 kV. The point-to-point resolution was 0.21 nm for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The samples were supported on carbon copper grids, and digital images were acquired using a CCD camera and digital micrograph software from GATAN. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used for the quantitative determination of the influence of irradiation on the (ΔHJT) magnitude of the JT effect of these oxides at low temperature. DSC measurements were carried out using DSC Q10 V9.4 equipment. Cyclic heating and freezing processes were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere between 20 and –90 °C at a heating rate of ± 5 °C/min. Aluminum pans and aluminum oxide were used as holders and the reference material, respectively. The instrumental precision and accuracy for the enthalpy change were 2% and 7%, respectively, when employing Hg(l) as the reference material. UV–Vis measurements were performed on the micrometric and nanometric samples by using a Spectrophotometer UV–Vis Hitachi U 2010. The samples were dispersed in water using an ultrasound bath during 15 min. The experiments were done between 200 and 1000 nm with a scan speed of 3 nm/ s and a path length of 1 nm. R.A. Rodríguez et al. Solid State Ionics 324 (2018) 77–86 78 3. Results 3.1. Characterization of the effect of gamma 60Co radiation on micro and nano-LiMn2O4 3.1.1. Micrometric LiMn2O4 oxide The as-prepared micrometric oxide crystallized in a cubic spineltype structure with a space group Fd-3 m and cell parameter of a = 8.240 Å (see black line in Fig. 1). The sample exhibits good crystallinity, which is reflected both in the value obtained for the cell parameter and in the peak width. Nevertheless, a small amount of Mn3O4 impurity can be observed in the XRD pattern. After irradiation at 630 kGy, no significant modification in the XRD pattern is detected, as can be observed from the difference diffraction pattern of both oxides (see red line in Fig. 1). This means that defects formed as a consequence of irradiation are present in too small of a concentration to be detected in bulk samples by conventional XRD. The SEM study showed that the as-prepared micrometric oxide is characterized by a heterogeneous crystallite size (see Fig. 2a). Micrometric and sub-micrometric clusters, such as microspheres, were observed. The electron diffraction pattern of this material (Fig. 2b) was indexed in the [111] direction with an interlayer distance for this plane of 4.75 Å, which is quite close to that obtained by XRD (4.76 Å). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) shows the electron diffraction contribution at several selected areas (Fig. 2c) in the irradiated sample and staking of the atomic plane along the LiMn2O4 lattice after irradiation (Fig. 2d). Small changes in the planes orientation can be observed for the [220] and [111] directions (boxes a and b in Fig. 2c, respectively). For the irradiated sample, arrays of edge dislocations are observed in low-angle frontiers, as seen in Fig. 2c and d. In Fig. 2d, a large increase of the interlayer distance is observed in the [111] direction (box a in Fig. 2d) compared with a non-defective area (box b in Fig. 2d). This fact is a measure of the great plane distortion suffered by the cationic polyhedral sites around these defective areas, possibly caused by the displacement of ions after irradiation. The empty interstitial position 16c and the position 8a occupied by lithium ions in the spinel LiMn2O4 structure are located in the space between the (111) planes; thus, these two sites should be affected by the new location of the shifted ions. The 7Li NMR-MAS spectra of both materials, irradiated and nonirradiated, offer valuable information about the local surroundings of the 7Li nuclei (see Fig. 3). In the deconvoluted spectrum of the non-irradiated sample (Fig. 3a), a main band centered at 534 ppm is observed, which is attributed to Li+ ions in the 8a tetrahedral position [19]. One additional small band can be observed at 602 ppm overlapped with the sideband closer to the main signal (Fig. 3a). This small band can be attributed 1) the presence of Li+ ions in the empty 16c octahedral position (Li⁎ i) [20] or 2) lithium ions in their normal spinel sites, but near defects in the lattice [19]. The relative quantity of Li ions presents in one of these two possible positions (1%) was calculated by integrating the area under the peaks. After the irradiation, an increase in the area of the band centered at 602 ppm and an asymmetric decay of the 7Li NMR-MAS spectrum can be observed (Fig. 3b and c). These two observations are related to the 10–17% increase in the lithium population in the new chemical surroundings (see Fig. 3c). Shifted Li ions can settle in 16c positions to form the Li⁎ i defect. On the other hand, some of the 8a tetrahedral can be distorted as a result of shifted neighboring atoms. The small nuclear charge and electronic density of Li+ does not allow it to greatly interact with radiation; thus, the modification of the Li+ distribution in the material could be interpreted as a consequence of the interaction of the Li+ ions with heavier ions, such as Mn3+ and Mn4+. In addition the modification of the Li+ distribution can stem from their movement to the vacancy created by Mn ions (creating LiMn ́ ́ or LiMn ́ ́ ́ defects). The large atomic charge and electronic density of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions, makes manganese to be the main target of the radiation and consequently causes these ions to undergo atomic shifts that give rise to the formation of stable defects inside the crystal. Two possible phenomena can be considered to explain the experimental results obtained above by HRTEM and 7Li RMN-MAS. First, 60Co irradiation can provoke a shift in the Mn ions to the 16c position, creating Mn⁎⁎⁎ i or Mn⁎⁎⁎⁎ i defects and their couple V ́ ́ ́ Mn and V ́ ́ ́ ́ Mn, respectively. The Li+ tetrahedron located close to these defects are expected to suffer large distortions. The other possibility is the creation of cation anti-site defects (Mn⁎⁎ Li or Mn⁎⁎⁎ Li together Li ́ ́ Mn or Li ́ ́ ́ Mn, respectively). In these anti-site defects, manganese and lithium ions switch their structural positions giving rise to the formation of a dipolar system as occurs between Mg2+ and Al3+ in spinel MgAl2O4 [11, 12]. Finally, oxygen shifting and oxygen vacancies can be expected as a consequence of irradiation as also occurs in MgAl2O4 spinel and MgO oxide [21–23]. When this happens, V centers (two oxygen, one of them ionized, O2−-Oi ́) are formed and F or F+ centers (oxygen vacancies V⁎⁎ O or V⁎ O, respectively) appear to compensate the charge. These defects directly influence the geometry of the Li+ tetrahedron and contribute to the 602 ppm signal. An assignation of O defects creation is usually made by observing UV–Vis absorptions about 3.2 (V center) and 5.3 eV (F centers), see the figure of supplementary file. Using this technique, any transition has been observed in the micrometric material because the larger particle size in micrometric particles makes the concentration of defects be small and the overlapping of the defects bands with the huge band of interband transitions O(2p)-Mn(t2g) and O(2p)-Mn(eg) makes difficult to observe modifications in the spectrums. Nevertheless, these defects cannot be neglected. Proves of this will show out further studying the nanometric material. Whatever the new positions of the shifted Mn ions, a large distortion will take place as a consequence of interaction with their new surroundings. The structural defects in general can introduce a different mechanism of stress relaxation [24, 25], playing a special role during cycling of the cathodic material [26] but also have influence over the magnitude of the JT effect. In Fig. 4, the formation mechanism of the defects because of irradiation is shown, which influences the enthalpy related to the reversible JT distortion, which occurs in this material at approximately 10 °C. As seen in Fig. 4, for the non-irradiated sample, a peak corresponding to JT distortion is observed during cooling. The transition of the non-irradiated sample begins at 11.4 °C, and the corresponding phase transition enthalpy during cooling and heating was 4.49 J/g and 2.65 J/g, respectively (see Table 1). Fig. 1. XRD measurement of the micrometric LiMn2O4 oxides: Non-irradiate oxide (black line), irradiated oxide (red line), difference pattern (green line). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) R.A. Rodríguez et al. Solid State Ionics 324 (2018) 77–86 79 The irradiated sample also exhibits a peak corresponding to JT distortion that presents two distinct effects during the first cooling cycle (Fig. 4). The resulting overall enthalpy (see Table 1) is 24 % lower than the corresponding energy of the non-irradiated sample. Successive heating and cooling cycles of the irradiated oxide, as shown in Fig. 4, converge in a caloric profile similar to that observed for the non-irradiated sample, with the difference that this profile corresponds an enthalpy value 28% lower than that of the non-irradiated oxide. The caloric profile in the first cycle of the irradiated sample had a different magnitude (Fig. 4), whereby the lower value of the enthalpy associated with JT distortion is unequivocal evidence of the creation of local defect environments in the material. These new environments are related to the new surroundings of some of the Li+ ions, as was observed by the 7Li NMR-MAS technique, but this result can also arise from the new manganese octahedral positions responsible for the magnitude of the JT distortion. The model that we propose to explain the decrease in the magnitude of the JT distortion is discussed in the next section. 3.1.2. Nanometric LiMn2O4 oxide The variation in the lattice parameter (Δa) vs the irradiation dose (i.e., 100, 630 and 1000 kGy) is shown in Fig. 5a.The trend shows very interesting behavior, featuring an increase in the lattice parameter at low doses (≤100 KGy) and a decrease at higher doses(≥600 kGy). The increase in the lattice parameter with doses has been previously reported in lithium-manganese spinel oxides irradiated with 30 kGy gamma radiation [27] while its behavior at high doses has not been reported. This behavior is clearly observed in the XRD patterns of irradiated LiMn2O4·First, the diffraction maxima shift to lower angles with an irradiation dose of up to 100 kGy and then back to higher values with an increase in the irradiation dose from 100 to 1000 kGy (Fig. 5b). Changes in the cell parameter are not observed for the sample with micrometric-sized particles, which reflects the greater capacity of the nanomaterials to display the influence of defects inside the structure with respect to the bulk materials. The observed trend shows the existence of a threshold in the relation between the lattice parameter and dose because of the accumulation and relaxation of defects in the nanometric material. To establish the influence of stable defects on the structural parameters over a long period of time (2 years), Rietveld analysis was carried out on anon-irradiated sample and the same sample after 2 years of irradiation at 100 kGy (see Tables 2 and 3, respectively). The non-irradiated oxide presents a lattice parameter a = 8.205(1) Å, Table 2. After 2 years, the same sample irradiated at 100 kGy exhibited a lattice parameter a = 8.208(2) Å (Table 3), which gives a difference between these two values of 0.003 Å. Though the cell parameter was still greater than that of the non-irradiated sample, the magnitude Δa decreased by approximately 6.5 times with respect to a recently irradiated sample. Additionally, a slight distortion in the oxygen position can still be observed (Table 3). The decrease in Δa after 2 years of the irradiation shows that relaxation mechanisms allow the structure to partially return to its initial state. a b c d Fig. 2. SEM (a) and HRTEM (b) images of the non-irradiated micrometric LiMn2O4 oxide. HRTEM images (c and d) of the LiMn2O4 oxide irradiated at a dose of 630 kGy. R.A. Rodríguez et al. Solid State Ionics 324 (2018) 77–86 80 Because XRD is a bulk technique, only the average characteristics of a structure can be measured. This prevents the possibility of detecting the influence of minor defects, such as microstructural defects, that have rather large average structural impacts, furthering our understanding of the Δa vs. dose behavior and the decrease in Δa overtime. Fig. 6 shows the effect of irradiation on the microstructure of nanometric lithium‐manganese oxide for doses of 100 kGy and 630 kGy. As can be observed in Fig. 6a and b, the nanometric oxide irradiated below the threshold has the same morphological characteristics as the non-irradiated sample, while the nanometric oxide irradiated at 630 kGy (Fig. 6d) presents noticeable morphological and microstructural changes with respect to the non-irradiated oxide and the oxide irradiated at 100 kGy. Studying the microstructure of the irradiated nanometric materials shown in Fig. 6c and e, it can be observed that due to the irradiation, edge dislocation occurs inside the crystallite, similar to the micrometric oxide. In the material irradiated at a low dose, shown in Fig. 6c, it is possible to observe partial and total dislocations. These partial dislocations are produced by the movement of atoms in the fcc structure from their normal position to an intermediate position described by the vector b1 (Fig. 7). In this new position, a change in the symmetry takes place, which induces large structural strain. Thus, at the beginning of the irradiation process, atomic displacements related to the change in symmetry of the Mn ions in the material occur. The generated strain seems to be responsible for the increase in the cell parameter observed by XRD (Fig. 5b). With an increase in irradiation dose and therefore the number of formed defects, total dislocations and morphological modifications are produced. In a total dislocation, the plane of displaced atoms returns to its initial symmetry configuration through a route marked by the vector b2, and a total displacement (b3) is produced, as shown in Fig. 7. The annihilation of defects on the surface and the restoration of the initial symmetry of the Mn ions in the dislocation eliminate the initially created strain, which enables the cell parameter to recover its initial value, as shown in Fig. 5b. Similar to the micrometric LiMn2O4 sample, in the 7Li NMR-MAS experiment of the nanometric oxide, the signal corresponding to Li+ atoms in the 8a positions appears at ~534 ppm, without any significant modification by the different doses, as shown in Fig. 8.

Solid State Ionics 324 (2018) 77–86 81 two phenomena can be observed as a consequence of irradiation. The first is related to the different decays of the curve near 517 ppm depending on the dose, as shown in Fig. 8 (see the main signal on the left side of the figure). The second phenomenon is related to the deformation of the signal between 560 and 590 ppm in the spectrum (and in the respective side bands) for doses of 630 kGy and 1000 kGy (see side band), as shown in Fig. 8c and d. This is in agreement with the trend observed by XRD of a cell parameter decrease with dose. The concentration of defects in the nanoparticles and the change in morphology due to relaxation of the defects become significant at a dose of 100 kGy. The way in which these deformations occur is characteristic of anisotropic shielding because of the non-isotropic magnetic distribution around the Li+ ions [28]. In normal spinel LiMn2O4, each Li+ ion is surrounded by a symmetric environment of equivalent positions of O2−, Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions. When the number of shifted Mn ions that form dislocations is high enough in comparison to the size of the nanocrystal, the loss of symmetry around Li+ is different for each orientation with respect to the external magnetic field. UV–Vis measurements (Supplementary file) as well as NMR measurements (Fig. 8), shows large variations between the samples irradiated in 630 kGy with respect to the non-irradiated and irradiated at 100 kGy samples, respectively. In this case, it was observed a dramatic rising of a band centered in 5 eV. This band reveals the formation of F centers into the structure due to the oxygen ions shifting. The DSC study of nanometric LiMn2O4o in the temperature range of −30 to 30 °C reveals a different behavior than that observed in the micrometric samples. In this material, JT distortion is not observed for the non-irradiated sample or for the samples irradiated at different doses (Fig. 9). The fact that JT distortion is absent in the non-irradiated nanometric sample can be related to the fact that the crystalline structure of the nanometric material presents structural parameters, such as the MneO bonding distance, that exhibit different behaviors with respect to those of the micrometric material. Details will be provided in the next section. Once the nature of these defects is known, we can propose a model to explain their influence on the JT distortion enthalpy as well as the corresponding benefit to the electrochemical properties, as has been reported for this material [2, 26]. 3.2. Action of defects on the JT distortion Before explaining the effect of defects on the JT distortion, let us depict the situation in which the MnO6 octahedrons are involved around the main defects (partial and total edge dislocations) in these irradiated samples. At an edge dislocation, as shown in Fig. 6c, the additional inserted Mn plane generates large repulsions with the neighboring Mn3+, Mn4+ and O2– ions forming part of the structure, as shown in Fig. 10. In addition, as shown above, along the dislocation area, the interlayer space grows dramatically. Loss of crystalline orientation and the increased interlayer generate a region that spreads throughout the dislocation, where the cooperative arrangement of JT distortions fades away and consequently the transition vanishes. At a partial dislocation, the change in symmetry from octahedral to tetrahedral around the Mn3+ ions induces the breakage of the MneO bond in the c direction, and consequently, the cooperative effect of the JT distortions is mitigated. As previously noted, a higher degree of crystallinity should allow the cooperative sum of the local deformation produced by the Mn3+ octahedrons to overcome the stability of the cubic symmetry [29]. The loss of directionality and increase in the MneO distance around dislocations or oxygen defects are the facts of major importance that attempt against JT distortion. Their implications in the micrometric and nanometric oxides are discussed in the following paragraphs. As shown in Section 3.1.1, the irradiated micrometric oxide presents total edge dislocations running through the [111] direction, and small changes in the plane orientation can be observed in the [111] and [220] directions. Furthermore, a large increase in the interlayer distance can be observed around the dislocation area. Changes in the plane orientation as well as dislocations limit the region in which cooperative distortion take place. a b Fig. 5. a) Dependence of the cell parameter in nanometric oxides on the radiation dose. b) Shifts of the (400) XRD maxima at different doses.

Solid State Ionics 324 (2018) 77–86 83 The effect of the metal-ligand bond distance was rigorously discussed by I.B·Bersuker et al. [30]. In an octahedral system, the JT energy depends quadratically on the metal-ligand bond strength in the direction of the distortion (c), as shown in Fig. 10. The decrease in the JT energy in the micrometric oxide can be explained by the increase in the MneO bond length along the dislocation. Additionally, the distortion of the manganese octahedrons along the dislocation contributes to spreading the distortion away from the c direction. To explain the absence of JT distortion in the non-irradiated and irradiated nanometric oxides, valuable insights can be obtained from the calculations of the average lithium-oxygen (dLieO) and manganeseoxygen (dMneO) bond distances and the average angle formed between oxygen-manganese and the MnO6 octahedral axis (O-Mn-Axe). Table 4 displays these parameters for the non-irradiated nanometric oxide as well as for previously reported bulk crystalline structures of cubic LiMn2O4 (Fd-3 m) and orthorhombic LiMn2O4 (Fddd). Despite the lower value of the cell parameter in the nanometric oxide (a = 8.205(1) Å) with respect to that usually found (a = 8.245 Å) in a well-crystallized bulk oxide, such as cubic-LiMn2O4 (# ICSD 155665), in the nanometric oxide, dMn-O is larger than that in the crystalline cubic structure, as shown in Table 4. As can be observed in the nanometric materials, dMn-O suffers a large expansion at the expense of decreasing the LieO bond distance. In Table 4, a slight difference exists in the O-Mn-Axe angles of these two oxides. This angle is important to measure the average distortion of the MnO6 octahedrons in the sample for comparison with the ideal structure. dMn-O in the nanometric material is also greater or comparable to the equilibrium bond distances reported for the orthorhombic LiMn2O4 phase [31–33] (# ICSD 155 665). Additionally, despite an increase in some of the O-Mn-Axe angles after the cubic to orthorhombic distortion, most of these values remain comparable to that of the nanometric oxide. The fact that dMn-O in the nanometric material is larger or comparable to that in the orthorhombic material allows to conclude that in nanometric materials, the forces responsible for driving the JT distortion are already compensated. This gives rise to a lack of energy able to drive the distortion. Furthermore, the small size of the nanocrystal prevents long-range JT cooperative effects and consequently the possibility to carry out the full structural transformation. Stable defects in the samples irradiated for 2 years give rise to an octahedral array that is more expanded and slightly more distorted, providing similar images as the non-irradiated nanomaterial. Table 5 displays the values obtained for the average lithium-oxygen (dLieO) bond distance, the manganese-oxygen bond distance in the z direction (dzMneO) and the angle formed between oxygen-manganese and the z axis (O-Mn-z) of the MnO6 octahedron. The same parameters are also shown for the bulk tetragonal phase (I41/amd) of Li2Mn2O4. The Li2Mn2O4 structure is the phase into which LiMn2O4 transforms after it is electrochemically lithiated. In Table 5, it can be observed that the irradiated nanomaterial has a dzMn-O value (Table 5) even greater than that obtained for the nonirradiated nanometric oxide (Table4). Consequently, the LieO bond distance is shorter. Additionally, the O-Mn-z angle exhibits a slightly greater value, which indicates that the MnO6 octahedrons are slightly more distorted in this direction. When cubic bulk LiMn2O4 transforms into tetragonal Li2Mn2O4 oxide in lithium-ion batteries, elongation of the MneO bond distance along the z direction occurs. As shown in the nanometric material, when dMn-O of both the cubic and the corresponding distorted phase at low temperature (LiMn2O4, Fddd) are similar, the energy driving the distortion vanishes. On the other hand, it was shown that in the irradiated micrometric oxide, an increase in the interlayer distance contributes to reducing the JT distortion energy. All, the similarity between the dMn-O of the irradiated nanometric LiMn2O4 and tetragonal Li2Mn2O4 as well as the presence of oxygen defects and partial and total dislocations in the irradiated nanometric LiMn2O4, support the idea that in this case, JT distortion will barely occur when the defective irradiated material is used in lithium-ion batteries over the 4 to 3 V region. Finally, the previous results allow us to conclude that dislocations and any defects that induce an increase in the Mn-O distance and the distortion of the MnO6 octahedron, for instance, oxygen shifting or cavities, can positively influence the mitigation of the JT distortion, thus improving the performance of the material in a battery. Because the JT effect presents a monotonic growth relationship with the corresponding lattice distortion (c/a) (ΔHJT ~ [c/a-1]) [29], as long as ΔHJT, is diminished the c/a ratio will follow the same tendency [29]. That fact appears to be very advantageous, as it decreases heterogeneous expansion and contraction of the crystalline structure during battery cycling. It has been shown that mechanical stress can lead to the brittle fracture of the material [3, 34]. This happen because physically one single particle is asymmetrically constrained by its neighbor particles generating strain contours, extended defects and microcracks [34]. Avoiding the large asymmetrical changes previously observed, it is possible to expand the capacity of the material and to increase the useful life of the battery. In fact, the previously shown relationship between ΔHJT and the c/a Fig. 8. 7Li NMR-MAS of the nanometric oxide: a) non-irradiated oxide and b,c,d) oxide irradiated at 100, 630 and 1000 kGy, respectively.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) R.A. Rodríguez et al. Solid State Ionics 324 (2018) 77–86 84 ratio as well as the capability of defects to decrease the value of ΔHJT, helps us understand why defects play an important role in the reversibility of defective materials when used in a battery [1, 26, 29, 35]. Defects represent a possible path towards dynamic strength relaxation in materials used in batteries, as is usually reported [24, 26]. However, because of their influence on ΔHJT, they allow the magnitude of the JT structural distortion to be smaller. 4. Conclusions 60Co gamma irradiation of LiMn2O4 generates partial and total edge dislocations. Due to the presence of these dislocations, the manganese and lithium ions modify their surroundings and coordination. Furthermore, oxygen shifting can be inferred. These aspects have the greatest influence on nanometric material, from which a large increase in the cell parameter was observed together with the apparition of the F center band, respectively. The modification of the Mn surroundings to form dislocations gives rise to the local deformation of its polyhedron. The combined action of the increased MneO bond distance in the nanoparticles and the dislocation plane together with the loss of directionality of this bond along the c axis and the formation of oxygen vacancies reduce the phase distortion enthalpy to less than that of a material with perfect polyhedra. This was clearly observed by comparing the DSC measurements of irradiated and non-irradiated micrometric samples. Because defects lower the ΔHJT of LiMn2O4, a minor distortion of the cell parameter (c/a) should be expected when this material is used as a cathode in lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, reduced stress between particles should occur; hence, this material should provide better battery performance. This fact has been supported by many papers examining the role that nanoparticles and other defective materials play when passing from the 4 V to the 3 V zone in a reversible manner.

Synthesis of layered LiMnO2 as an electrode for rechargeable lithium batteries A. Robert Armstrong & Peter G. Bruce School of Chemistry, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9ST, UK RECHARGEABLE lithium batteries can store more than twice as much energy per unit weight and volume as other rechargeable batteries1•2• They contain lithium ions in an electrolyte, which shuttle back and forth between, and are intercalated by, the electrode materials. The first commercially successful rechargeable lithium battery\ introduced by the Sony Corporation in 1990, consists of a carbon-based negative electrode, layered LiCo02 as the positive electrode, and a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte. The high cost and toxicity of cobalt compounds, however, has prompted a search for alternative materials that intercalate lithium ions. One such is LiMn20 4, which has been much studied as a positive electrode material4-7; the cost of manganese is less than 1 % of that of cobalt, and it is less toxic. Here we report the synthesis and electrochemical performance of a new material, layered LiMn02, which is structurally analogous to LiCo02• The charge capacity of LiMn02 (,"270 mA h g-1) compares well with that of both LiCo02 and LiMn20 4, and preliminary results indicate good stability over repeated charge-discharge cycles. Many attempts have been made to prepare layered LiMnO2 mainly involving the use of aqueous solutions810• The resulting products, though interesting, have stoichiometries which differ from LiMnO2, contain water or protons, are of poor crystallinity or do not maintain their structure during cycling. In contrast we have succeeded in preparing layered, anhydrous and stoichiometric LiMnO2 which is analogous to LiCoO2 and may be cycled in a rechargeable battery; it is obtained by ion exchange from NaMnO2• The sodium compound was synthesized by solid-state reaction between stoichiometric quantities of Na2CO3 and manganese (m) oxide at 700-730 °C for 18-72 hours under flowing argon11• LiMnO2 was obtained by refluxing NaMnO2 with an excess of LiCI or LiBr in n-hexanol at 145-150 °C for 6-8 hours. After cooling to room temperature the product was filtered under suction and washed, first with n-hexanol and then with ethanol, and dried 12• Phase purity was established by powder X-ray diffraction. The layered structure of LiMnO2 was confirmed by powder neutron diffraction carried out on the POLARIS diffractometer at the ISIS pulsed source (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) (Fig. la).

A common structure obtained when attempts are made to prepare compounds with the LiMnO2 composition is that of tetragonally distorted spine! Li2Mn2O4 (ref. 4).

The Li~ and Mn3+ ion occupancies were free to refine on both sites, the only constraint being that the total occupancy of each site was set to equal one. The total lithium and manganese contents were respectively 1.02(7) and 0.98(7), consistent with the LiMnO2 stoichiometry. Atomic absorption analysis was carried out (Unicam PU9400X) and provided further confirmation of the stoichiometry. The maximum occupancies of Li on the Mn sites (2a) and Mn on the Li (2d) sites were respectively 0.10(3) and 0.09( 4), demonstrating that the lithium and manganese ions reside predominantly on their own sites. Due to the strong Jahn-Teller nature of high-spin Mn3+(3d4), the local site symmetry around the Mn 3+ ions is distorted somewhat from a regular octahedron and the crystal structure is not rhombohedral but monoclinic (space group C2/m ). The crystallographic data are given in Table 1. Interest in layered LiMnO2 as a positive electrode in rechargeable lithium batteries stems from the fact that Li+ ions and electrons may be removed and reinserted into this compound, that is, it is an intercalation host for lithium. The electrochemical performance of LiMnO2 was investigated with a three-electrode cell composed of lithium metal counter and reference electrodes, the working electrode being fabricated by compressing powdered LiMnO2 (80%), carbon black (13.3%) and PTFE (6.7%) on to a metal grid. The electrolyte consisted of a 1 M solution of LiCIO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate. The salt was rigorously dried by heating under vacuum at 150 °C and the solvent was distilled as described elsewhere 14• The cell was subjected to charging at a current density of 10 μAcm· 2• The resulting voltage curve is shown in Fig. 2. These data confirm that up to 0.95 lithiums per formula unit may be extracted from LiMnO2 on initial charging, corresponding to a capacity of 270 mA h g1• Preliminary measurements at the much higher current density of 0.5 mAcm· 2 suggest that a capacity approaching 200 mA h g-1 may be obtained up to a cut-off potential of 4.3 V. The earliest lithium batteries, introduced in the 1980s, used lithium metal as the negative electrode. Despite some problems with flammability, there is still interest in using such cells for electric-vehicle applications because of their high gravimetric energy density. For such cells cathodes with a potential of 3 V are sufficient.

A practical capacity of ~ 150 mA h g-1 is obtainable from the cathode used in the present generation of commercially available rechargeable lithium batteries, that is, LiCoO2• A slightly smaller practical capacity may be obtained at 3 and 4 volts from LiMn2O4• The capacities of 200 and 270 mA h g· 1 obtained on intially charging LiMnO2 and already mentioned above, demonstrate that this compound is both scientifically interesting and potentially attractive as a cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries. However a full analysis of the utility of this cathode in comparisson with others will require extensive measurements of the capacity variation on cycling at different current densities and over different voltage ranges. Some preliminary cycling data are presented below. X-ray diffraction data reveal that for (1 x) ""0.5 in Li1_,MnO2 the structure is rhombohedral. On removal of lithium from LiMnO2, the Jahn-Teller active MnH ion is oxidized to Mn4+ with the resulting loss of the monoclinic distortion. The layered compound also exhibits a voltage transition at a composition of ~Li05MnO2• This is the same composition (LiMn2O4) at which lithium manganese oxide with the spine! structure transforms from a 3 V to 4 V cathode, suggesting that the voltage transition is not related specifically to the spine! structure. However, a full discussion of these more detailed aspects must await the availability of further structural data. Some preliminary cycling data are presented in Fig. 3. The cell was cycled at a constant current density of 0.5 mAcm-2 between the potential limits 3.4 and 4.3 V. Previous studies using cyclic voltammetry indicated that the electrolyte was stable in contact with this electrode up to at least 4.4 V. X-ray diffraction carried out on the layered material at different stages of cycling indicate that the layered structure, is retained during lithium removal and reinsertion. Although the capacity declines on eyeing, it must be stressed that the voltage range has not been opitimized and includes both voltage plateaux. In the case of the LiMn2O4 spine!, cycling over both plateaux results in a greater capacity fade than if confined to just one plateau. It should also be recalled that the early spine! materials showed very poor cyclability, and only later optimization yielded satisfactory results. D 8. Rossouw, M. H., Liles, D. C. & Thackeray, M. M.

The ideal spine1 structure, A[Bz]Od can be described as a cubic close-packed array of oxide ions in which only one-half of the octahedral and one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites are occupied. There are eight molecules per unit cell and oxygens are located at the 32e position of space group Fd3m. The B cations occupy octahedral sites at * To whom correspondence should be addressed. 16d, the empty octahedral sites are at 16~. The 64 tetrahedral interstices are at the three nonequivalent positions 8a, 8b, and 48f; the A cations occupy site 8a. Each 8a tetrahedron shares common faces with four neighboring empty 16~ octahedra which allows a possible diffusion pathway for the A cations, 8a ---, 16~ + 8a + 16~ * etc., through the structure. In contrast, the 8b tetrahedra share faces with the 16d octahedra occupied by the B cations, which renders them energetically unfavorable for cation occupation. The 48f tetrahedra share faces with both 16d and empty 16~ octahedra. A cation distribution of A[B2]04 and B[A,B]04 is classified as a normal and inverse spinel, respectively. Mixed (or intermediate) spinels have a cation arrange0022-4596186 $3.00 Copyright 0 1986 by Academic Press, Inc.

It has been established by X-ray (1) and neutron diffraction (10) studies that the [&]04 sublattice of the A[B2]04 spine1 structure remains intact upon lithium insertion/extraction and provides a three-dimensional (3D) framework and an interstitial space of edge-shared octahedra connected in three dimensions for Li+ ion diffusion as shown in Fig. 1. Previous studies indicate that on lithium insertion into spine1 the lithium ions in Li,A[&]O4 occupy the octahedral 16~ vacant sites up to x = 1 and the tetrahedral A @a) cations are cooperatively displaced to octahedral 16~ sites producing partially ordered rock salt-like phases, e.g., {LiFe}[Fez]Od where the curly bracket stands for the 16~ octahedral sites. Additional lithium ions inserted (1 5 x I 2) must therefore occupy the empty 8a and/or 48f sites (I, 7, 20). Because the Li+ ions in these tetrahedral sites scatter X rays WeaW, the fully lithiated phases Li2A[B2]04 also show a rock salt-like diffraction powder pattern. As mentioned earlier, the interconnected 16~ and 8a (or 48f) sites form a continuous 3D pathway for Li+ ion transport. Thus cations other than Li+ FIG. 1. Half a unit cell of the spine1 structure (after Ref. (7)) showing the position of: (O) 8a and (0) 16d cations; (0) some of the 32e oxygens; 8b, (0) 48f, and (*) 16c interstitial sites in one quarter (two octants) of the unit cell. in these sites will hinder more strongly the diffusion of inserted Li+ ions due to coulombic considerations. We have studied the effect of cation distribution on the extent of lithium insertion in a series of iron spinels and found that the lithium content decreases in the order inverse > “mixed” > normal spinels (13). It appears that only in the inverse spinels, where a reducible cation (Fe3+[Fe2+, Fe3+]04) is present in the 8u tetrahedral site, can more than one Li+ ion be inserted per formula unit (e.g., Li2Fe304 vs LiMn304). Furthermore, in these spinels Li+ ions in excess of x > 1 can be removed by chemical or electrochemical delithiation (LiFe304 and LiMn304 cannot be delithiated) (13). In contrast, the normal lithium spinels with Li+ ions in the 8u sites, Li[&]04 with B = Ti, V, Mn undergo lithium insertion reversibly to form Li2[B2]04 phases (2-20). In this paper we report lithium insertion reaction studies of three lithium spinels with different lithium content in the A site: Fe[Li0.5Fei.5]Os (inverse, 0% Li+ in 8~); Zno.sLio.s[Lio.SMn1.504 (mixed, 50% Li in 8~); Li[Feo.~Mni.s]O~ (normal, 100% Li in 8u). We have chosen these compounds to study the effect of Li+ occupancy of the tetrahedral A(8u) sites on the lithium insertion reaction of spine1 phases, particularly with respect to reversibility. Experimental Fe[L&Fei.~]O~ (or LiFesOs) was prepared according to Wickham (14). Fine powders of Fe203 and Li2CO3 (5 : 1 in mole ratio) mixed with Li2S04 and Na2S04 in a platinum crucible were calcined at 800°C for 1 hr in air, followed by washing away the salts with water. Lio.sZno.s[Lio.sMnl.s04 (or Li2ZnMn30s) and Li[Fe0.~Mnl.5]OJ (or Li2FeMn30s) were prepared after the method of Blasse by solid state reaction of stoichiometric mixtures of ZnO or Fe203, 242 CHEN, GREENBLATT, AND WASZCZAK LizCOj, and MnCOs, respectively (25, 16). Chemical treatment of the spine1 phases with n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) in dry hexane was carried out at room temperature with magnetic stirring for several days in a Hefilled glovebox. The electrochemical lithiation was carried out in a small test cell (17) with Li metal as the anode, a mixture of one of the lithium host spinels and graphite (20 wt%) in the form of a compacted pellet as the cathode and 1 M HC104 in propylene carbonate (PC) as the electrolyte. Current densities of 10 to 30 PA/cm2 were employed and the open circuit voltages (V) were recorded intermittently after equilibrium was reached as indicated by a constant potential. Delithiation of the lithiated compounds was performed with 2,3-dichloro-4,5dicyanobenzoquinone in CH$N (DDQ/ CH$N. The lithium content of the lithiated and delithiated compounds was determined by acid-base back-titration and/ or plasma emission spectroscopy. All the host spinels and reaction products were identified by powder X-ray diffraction methods using Ni-filtered copper radiation, with Si powder as internal standard. Samples were protected from air in a specially designed holder which was assembled in the drybox. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured using the Faraday method as described previously (Z8). 57Fe Mossbauer experiments were carried out in transmission geometry using a Pd(S7Co) source. For two-probe measurement of qualitative electrical conductivities finely ground sample powders were pressed into thin pellets in a Teflon cylinder by two stainlesssteel plungers which also served as the two leads. Results and Discussion LiFesOs. On lithium insertion the redbrown color of a-LiFeSO* changed to black in a few hours and a gradual loss of magnetic interaction of the powder with the magnetic stirrer was observed. The maximum lithium content of the fully lithiated product is Lir+,FesOs, x = 4 (or x = 2 in Li0.5+xFe2.504). This is additional evidence that it is possible to insert two lithium ions into spinels when a reducible cation is present in the 8a tetrahedral site, as previously demonstrated in the inverse spine1 ferrites Fe3+[Fe2+ Fe3]04 (I ) and Fe3+ [Ni2+, Pe3+]04 (13i. It appears that electron transfer from the inserted lithium atoms is facilitated when both the Li and the reducible metal ions (displaced from 8a to 16~) are in crystallographically equivalent positions (16~). Subsequent charge transfer (SC > 1) which involves reduction of 16d transition metal ions may occur via 8a 16d, d p 7r interactions if the additional Li atoms go into the empty 8a sites, or via 48f-16d interactions if the x > 1 Li atoms occupy 48f sites, or both of these may be operative; neutron diffraction powder profile analysis might resolve these ambiguities. Powder X-ray diffraction data of the host lithium spinels and their lithiated analogs are summarized in Table I. The X-ray diffraction pattern of ordered cy-Fe:+[Li Fei+]08 was indexed based on space group P433 (No. 212) or P4,3 (No. 213) while that of LiSFesOs was indexed on the basis of space group Fd3m (No. 227). The unit cell parameters were determined by leastsquares refinement of the observed X-ray diffraction peaks. Insertion of lithium into LiFeJOg results in a small expansion of the cubic cell dimension from 8.320 to 8.394 A, which corresponds to -2.6% increase in the unit cell volume. The X-ray intensity data (Table I) show that LiSFeS08 has a structure similar to an Fe0 rock salt type (19). This indicates that in LiSFeSOs as in lithiated Fe304 (I ) and other lithiated spine1 ferrites (13) a displacement of the A(8a) cations to the neighboring 16~ octahedral site occurs.

In general the cubic spinel-to-rock salt transition is accompanied by a decrease of the ratio of the 220/440 and an increase in the ratio of 400/422 diffraction intensities (Z2JZ440, Z.&Z422) as a result of the diffusion of strong-scattering cations from tetrahedral @a) to octahedral (16~) sites as discussed previously (I). For LisFesOg, Z220 and Zdz2 are zero, which strongly suggest that only the weakly scattering Li+ ions occupy the tetrahedral sites. 2 are in good agreement with results of chemical lithiation. The plot of open-circuit voltage vs x for the Li/LiFesOs cell is similar to that of the Li/Fe304 cell.

The plateau in the region of 0.4 I x I 0.9 for Li/Li0.5Fe2.504 may be due to the disordering of lithium and iron ions in the 16d site. The long equilibration time required to obtain stable opencircuit voltages in the cell after the current is discontinued is evidence that the diffusion rate of Li+ ions in this spine1 is slow as in other spine1 fenites. Qualitative, two-probe electrical resistivity measurements at room temperature of LiS(Fe$+Fe3+)0s yield a value p 10 &cm, which is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the resistivity of the host, (YLiFe:+Os (p > lo7 R-cm) as expected for the mixed valent Fe3+P+ lithiated compound where electron hopping (or band conduction) might be responsible for the high conductivity observed. The temperature variation of the magnetic susceptibility of LiSFeSOs shown in Fig. 3 cannot be fit to a Curie-Weiss law in any range of the temperature measured (4.2-300 K). At low temperature (T < 20 K) the susceptibility saturates and exhibits a time dependence characteristic of a spin glass state (20). This behavior indicates that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are present in a lattice of randomly distributed magnetic ions, and that the exchange energies are large. 6.00 I 1 1 loo 200 300 T (K) FIG. 3.

The room-temperature 57Fe Mossbauer spectrum of the magnetically ordered a-Li FeJOs is shown in Fig. 4. The observed spectrum of the host spine1 is in good agreement with previously published results (21). The single broad resonance of the lithiated phase indicates that the magnetic ordering of the host is destroyed upon lithium insertion. The asymmetry and lineshape of the band suggest that iron in two different oxidation states (Fe2+, Fe3+) is present. However, the spectrum is not resolved sufficiently for a meaningful fit of the Mossbauer parameters. At low temperature (T < 20 K), the broad resonance of LisFesOs splits into a complex multiline hyper-fine pattern indicative of magnetic ordering. The shape and quality of the spectrum are typical of a disordered distribution of magnetic interactions in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility data. Li2FeMn30~ and Li2ZnMn3Og. Roomtemperature lithium insertion of black Li2ZnMn3Os and LizFeMnJOs by n-BuLi LITHIUM INSERTION COMPOUNDS 245 yield L&ZnMnsOs (x = 1 in Lii+xZno.s Mn1,504) and Li4FeMn30s (x = 1 in Lil+, ~eo.~Mnl.Od, respectively. No clear color change could be seen in the former sample, but a change to a red-brown color upon lithium insertion is observed in the latter. Delithiation of the fully lithiated compound Li4FeMn30s with excess DDQ/ CH3CN restores the original color and the cubic spine1 phase of the host, Liz FeMnjOs . Thus lithium insertion is reversible in (Li[Feo.5Mnl.~]0~) normal lithium spine1 and is similar to the previously reported behavior of Li[Mnz]Od (2), Li[Ti2]04 (8), and Li[V2]04 (11). In contrast, very little lithium can be removed from the fully lithiated “mixed” lithium spine1 Li4ZnMn30s (Table II); rather a mixture of phases, indicative of decomposition, were observed in samples delithiated by DDQ/ CH3CN. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the host spinels, LiZZnMn30S and Li2FeMn30s, was indexed based on Fd3m (Table I) while those of their lithiated analogs fit the tetragonal space group F4Jddm (alternate setting for Z4Jamd space group No. 141). The absence of 220 reflection in all these phases except in Li2ZnMn30s suggests that there are no strong X-ray scattering cations (Fe3+ or Z$+) in the 8a tetrahedral sites (i.e., probably {Liz},6,.[Feo,5 Mm.h& and (Li~.~Zno.s}~~~[Lio.5Mn~.51~~~ 04 result upon lithiation). The X-ray diffraction data for Li4ZnMn30s and LidFeMn3Os (Table I) show the tetragonal distortion present due to the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect of octahedrally coordinated Mn3+(d4) compounds (22). The axial ratios (c/a) are 1.135 and 1.117 for L&ZnMn30s and L&FeMn30s, respectively. This is direct evidence that the charge compensating electrons that accompany Li+ insertion are transferred to the Mn4+ ions and thereby increase the concentration of the Mn3+(d4) ions beyond the critical concentration (usually -one Mn3+ ion per spine1 formula) necessary for the onset of the Jahn-Teller distortion. It has been shown that there is no clear-cut relationship between the concentration of the Mn3+ ions TABLE 11 SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF LITHIUM/EXTRACTION IN SELECTED LITHIUM SPINEL PHASES Compound .rh Reversibdlty Ref. a-F.++[Lii ~Fe;;lOl (a-LiFesO*) Lie sZno.s[Lio sMn:;104 (LizZnMrq08) Lit olFe~:Mt$\Mn$04 (Li?FeMn,Os) Lit t$Ti3+Ti4+104 Lit.~[Mn3iMn“+104 8.320(2) 1.8 f 0.2 8.220(2) 1.0 -t 0.2 8.256(2) I.0 -c 0.2 8.410 I.0 2 0.2 8.242 1.0 2 0.2 LI = 8.394(2) (I = x.

In the present compounds the importance of other cations in the 16d site effecting Jahn-Teller distortion is demonstrated again: Li3Zn[LiMr$Mn4+] 0s is more distorted than Li4[Fe3+Mnif]08. The room-temperature j7Fe Mossbauer spectrum of Li2FeMn30s and its lithiated analog in Fig. 5 show conclusively that the oxidation state of iron is 3+ in both the host and lithiated phases. The symmetrical doublet in each spectrum (Fig. 5) is characteristic of high-spin Fe3+ ions (isomer shift -0.3 mm/set and quadrupole splitting = 1 .O mm/ set). These results demonstrate that the Mn4+ ions are more readily reduced than Fe3+ or Mn3+ upon lithium insertionlreduction in spinels. The magnetic susceptibility of L&Fe Mn30s and Li4FeMn30s measured 4.2300 K shown in Fig. 6 cannot be fit to a Curie-Weiss law with meaningful magnetic parameters in any range of the measured temperatures.

Temperature variation of the magnetic susceptibility of (a) Li2FeMnJ08 and (b) Li4FeMn908. FeMn30s compound is characteristic of a spin glass state (20). There is no evidence of this state in the lithiated phase down to 4.2 K even though the data indicate a disordered distribution of strong magnetic interactions. The plot of open-circuit voltage (V) vs lithium composition (x) for the Li/Li [Fe0.~Mnl.~]04 cell is shown in Fig. 7. The shape of this plot is very similar to that observed for the Li/Li[Mn2]04 cell (2). This is not unexpected since both host spinels are 100% normal (i.e., only Li+ ions in tetrahedral 8a sites) and both of their lithiated compounds exhibit a Jahn-Teller tetragonal distortion (c/a > 1). The plateau in the V vs x plot represents a cubicltetragonal twoLITHIUM INSERTION COMPOUNDS 247 phase region in the compositional range 0.06 < x < 0.7. Since the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation is first-order, this two-phase region separates the cubic (0 5 xc s 0.06) and the tetragonal (X 2 0.7) single phases. As indicated by Goodenough et al. (7), this type of two-phase region in electrochemical cells can provide high energy density instead of reducing the power performance of the electrode materials. This is because the Jahn-Teller distortion occurring in the course of lithium insertion represents a diffusionless phase transition with a strain-free phase boundary; hence, the motion of phase boundary may be faster than the diffusion of the Li+ ions in the 3D interconnected interstitial space. Room-temperature qualitative two-probe electrical resistivity measurements of Liz FeMn3Os and Li4FeMn308 show that the resistivity of the host (p lo3 o-cm) dramatically increases upon lithiation (p > lo7 &cm for Li4FeMn30s). Similar measurements of the resistivity of Li2ZnMn30s and Li4ZnMn30s showed a marked decrease in the resistivity of the lithiated phase. These results support the assignment of the oxidation states of the ions as Li4Fe3+Mn:+Os and L&Zn(Mn:+Mn4+)Os as discussed before, and indicate that mobile d electrons in the mixed valent Li2Fe3+(Mni+Mn3+)Os host and L&Zn(Mni+Mn4+)08 lithiated compounds are responsible for the low resistivities. Conclusions From the results of lithium insertion/extraction in the three title lithium spinels summarized in Table II (along with data for Li[Ti2]04 and Li[Mnz]04) the following conclusions may be made: 1. The higher lithium uptake upon lithium insertion reactions of the inverse spine1 Fe3+[Li0.sFe::]04 (a-LiFesOg) relative to the other two lithium spinels studied here is further evidence that lithium insertion into spinels is facilitated by the presence of readily reducible cations in the 8a tetrahedral sites as previously demonstrated in other inverse spine1 ferrites, Fe304 (I) and Fe[NiFe]Od (13). This is probably due to the ease of electron transfer from the inserted Li atoms to the reducible transition metal ions when both are in crystallographically equivalent positions at 16~. If the additional (x > 1) Li atoms enter the 48fsites which share faces with the 16d octahedra, an easy path of charge transfer for the reduction of transition metal ions at that site may be accounted for. 2. There is direct evidence of electron transfer from the inserted lithium to reducible transition metal cations in the spine1 by the onset of the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect in the manganese spinels due to increase of the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio as previously observed in related spinels (2). 3. Mdssbauer data confirm that in Li [Fe~:Mn~:Mn4+]04, (Li2FeMn30s) Mn4+, rather than Fe3+ or Mn3+ ions are reduced upon lithium insertion. 4. Li2FeMn308 may be a good cathode material for secondary lithium batteries since (a) the lithium insertion process is reversible and (b) the Li/Li2FeMn308 cell exhibits a composition-independent open-circuit voltage of -3.0 V against metallic lithium over the range 0.06 I x % 0.7. 5. Only 100% normal lithium spinels such as L&FeMn308, LiTi204, LiV204, and LiMnz04 display complete reversibility in room-temperature tions. lithium insertion reacAcknowledgments We are grateful to R.

Piszora ∗ Laboratory of Magnetochemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University, Grunwaldzka 6, PL-60780 Pozna ́n, Poland Received 15 October 2004; received in revised form 15 February 2005; accepted 16 February 2005 Available online 3 June 2005 Abstract Structural characterization of the new low temperature polymorph of the lithium-deficient lithium–manganese spinel, synthesized and quenched from 1073 K has been obtained by Rietveld structure refinements of X-ray powder diffraction data recorded using synchrotron radiation. A slight lithium ions deficiency causes formation of the tetragonal phase provided that the samples obtained at high temperature are rapidly quenched in the solid CO2. The new phase has a tetragonally distorted spinel structure at 140 K with a space group F41/ddm, unit cells of a = 8.33180(6) ̊A and c = 8.08617(7) ̊A. On heating, at 280 K, the tetragonal phase transforms to cubic spinel structure (Fd3m) and it remains cubic up to 1163 K. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction The demands for the lighter, smaller and more powerful secondary battery increase with the population of electronic devices such as cellular phone, notebook computer and video camera. Nowadays the lithium secondary battery is one of the most promising for the portable electronic devices. LiMn2O4 spinel oxide is a good candidate material for a cathode of lithium secondary battery due to its economical and nontoxicity advantages. At room temperature the crystal structure of LiMn2O4 belongs to the Fd3m space group of a cubic system. The distribution of cations in LiMn2O4 is represented by the following ionic formula: Li+8a[Mn3+Mn4+]16dO2−4, where 8a and 16d refer to the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the cubic spinel structure. Many fast synthesis methods, such as microwave technique [1], pulsed laser deposition [2,3] and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis [4,5], are applied recently in order to obtain LiMn2O4 with the good electrochemical Li charge–discharge ∗Tel.: +48 61 8291262; fax: +48 61 8658008.

Nevertheless, the short time thermal annealing is followed often by the fast cooling of the samples and leads to the preservation of the average Mn valence and the high temperature Mn cations distribution. The research of the lithium–manganese spinel at high temperature has been hitherto undertaken, but with contradictory results (Table 1). Several authors have observed the formation of tetragonal spinel phases at 1053 < T < 1188 K [9–16], whereas no evidence for their existence up to 1253 K has been found by other authors [17–20]. The tetragonally distorted lithium-manganese spinel oxide has been observed, but only for samples partially decomposed to the lithiumdeficient Li1−xMn2+xO4, and to the lithium-rich phase, e.g. Li2MnO3. The thermal stability of LiMn2O4 had been studied in-situ by Thackeray et al. [9] using X-ray diffractometer equipped with a high temperature attachment. They have found that in the temperature region of 1113–1273 K the lithium-rich Li2MnO3 phase coexists with the tetragonal lithium deficient lithium–manganese spinel (c/a = 1.02 at 1073 K). At the temperature above 1233 K LiMnO2 is created, whereas 0925-8388/$ – see front matter © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jallcom.2005.02.059 P.

The high temperature spinel structure samples have been defined as the Li[Mn2]O4–Mn[Mn2]O4 solid-solution members with defects in the oxygen sublattice. Strobel et al. [11] have performed neutron diffraction investigation of Li1.05Mn2O4−δ samples quenched from 1073 and 1198 K. From the Rietveld refinement, they have concluded that sample quenched from 1198 K consists of Li2MnO3 (9 wt%) and of the tetragonal Li0.89(3)Mn2O3.84(8) (91 wt%) with deficiency in the cationic tetrahedral, as well as in the anionic sublattices of the spinel structure. A sample quenched from 1073 K consists of the cubic LiMn2O4 (97.1 wt%) and Li2MnO3 (2.9 wt%). The obtained experimental errors suggest that for the tetragonally distorted structure the oxygen sites could be almost fully occupied, however, authors have not discussed the possibility of migration of manganese ions to tetrahedral sites. In spite of the fact that slow cooling process usually guarantees the cubic structure of LiMn2O4 [22], the tetragonal distortion has been reported also for ‘furnace-cooled’ samples [15]. The tetragonal phase with c/a ratio lower than one has been reported earlier for samples quenched from a high temperature. Yang et al. [12] have indexed the X-ray patterns of the tetragonally distorted spinel phase with c/a < 1, but only as one of the alternative, and with a dose of uncertainty because of the multiphase system. The existence of this ‘flattened’ lithium–manganese spinel structure has been confirmed, using Rietveld refinement, for the members of the LixMn(II) 1−x−zFe(III) z [Fe(III) n(3−x)−zMn(III,IV) (1−n)(3−x)+x+z−1]O4 series [16]. The DSC results have revealed that the phase transition in the lithium-deficient Li1−yMn2O4−δ samples appears at higher temperature (∼308 K) [20], then in the earlier reported stoichiometric LiMn2O4 (∼285 K) [23].

The nature of the phase transition depends on the stoichiometry of a sample. Results presented in this paper are related to the sample with composition that gives rise to a mixture of the new ‘flattened’ tetragonal phase and of the orthorhombic phase. For composition with lower deficit of lithium only the orthorhombic phase was observed, whereas for higher lithium deficit one can observe the pure ‘flattened’ tetragonal phase, and for the highest lithium deficit the ‘elongated’ tetragonal phase appears [16]. 2. Experimental procedure The Li0.98Mn2.02O4 sample was obtained by the solidstate reaction of Li2CO3 (99.0% Merck) with the manganese oxide precursor, -Mn2O3. The precursor was prepared by precipitation of Mn-hydroxide from Mn2+ nitrate solution (Mn(NO3)2.6H2O, 99.0% Merck) with sodium hydroxide (98.8% POCH). Washed and dried at room temperature, it was dehydrated for 2 h at 523 K, and then successively at 673, 773 and 873 K for 4 h in air. Crystalline single-phase precursor displays the bixbyite (Ia3) structure. The spinel sample was obtained from Li2CO3 (Merck) and -Mn2O3 powders, by reaction of the components in air at 973 K and, after grinding, at 1073 K for 4 h. Finally, the sample was quenched rapidly in the solid CO2. The conventional laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data (Fe K radiation) at room temperature confirmed the formation of crystalline phase displaying cubic structure (space group Fd3m) and some traces of the phase with the tetragonal spinel structure (space group F41/ddm). Investigations on the temperature phase transitions were carried out at the synchrotron beam-line I711 at MAX-Lab with an image foil Huber 670 Guiner camera [24] with a Cryostream Cooler (Oxford Cryosystem) and with furnace P.

Sample mounted in 0.3 mm capillary tubes (Hilgenberg) underwent the heating and cooling procedures in the temperature range from 110 to 1173 K. The wavelength, λ = 1.08632 ̊A, was determined by calibration using NIST silicon standard. The data analysis was performed with the GSAS software [25]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Measurements at high temperature Results for the cubic spinel phase obtained from structure refinements are summarized in Table 2. The unit-cell paFig. 1.

Open circles: ionic radii of Mn3+ from interpolation. rameter resulting from Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns, reveals the linear dependence of temperature in the region from room temperature to ∼1073 K (Fig. 1a). At the higher temperature the lattice constant a increases rapidly with the temperature also in the linear fashion. Tendency to the increase of lattice constant at temperature about 1073 K is in good agreement with that reported before for its rising with calcination temperature of the LiMn2O4 sample [17,26]. Assuming linear dependence of temperature the turning point for the examined sample can be established at 1045 K. Because of the high crystal field stabilization of Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions on octahedral sites, the most probable cation on the tetrahedral site is Mn2+. High temperature delivers the sufficient reduction condition to stabilize the Mn2+ ions. The comparison of ionic radii shows that only the presence of Mn2+ cations on tetrahedral sites can lead to the expansion of the unit-cell volume (Fig. 2). Fig. 3. Observed, calculated and difference profiles resulting from the Rietveld analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data collected on Li0.98Mn2.02O4 sample at 140 K. The ticks show the 2 positions for the Bragg peaks of the orthorhombic phase (upper row), tetragonal phase (middle row) and the h-BN phase added for temperature calibration (lower row). 38 P. Piszora / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 401 (2005) 34–40 Fractional manganese occupancy on the tetrahedral sites, obtained from Rietveld refinement, increases rapidly above 1045 K (Fig. 1b). Both unit-cell parameter and fractional manganese occupancy of tetrahedral sites lead to the conclusion, that above 1045 K manganese ions migrate to the tetrahedral positions and reduce their oxidation state to +2. This effect corresponds well to the theoretical predictions reported earlier [28] and to the lattice constant dependence on the LiMn2O4 synthesis temperature [17,26]. In spite of the fact that the presumed chemical composition suggests fractional occupancy of 0.02 Mn on tetrahedral 8a sites, the Rietveld refinement shows the higher manganese content on this position. The higher Mn content is comprehensible, because the sample was synthesized at 1073 K, at the temperature by about 28 K higher then the established limit. These results reveal that to control the 8a site ocFig. 4.

The open question remains where the Li ions pushed out from the 8a sites by Mn ions are located. There are two possibilities, both suggested by experiment and theoretical predictions [17,28]: 1) Li ions locate in the lithium-rich additional phase such as Li2MnO3, 2) Li ions locate on the 16c spinel site. The planned neutron diffraction measurements should solve the problem. 3.2. New low temperature phase transition Synchrotron X-ray diffraction pattern of the lithium deficient sample collected at 140 K shows the tetragonally distorted spinel structure, but what should be stressed, this new phase is not equivalent to the low temperature polymorph of LiMn2O4 and, in the examined sample, coexists with the well defined orthorhombic structure (space group Fddd) (Figs. 3 and 4). To reduce the time cost of calculations, the orthorhombic phase was indexed using ‘small’ unit cell (e.g. a = 8.25846(16) ̊A, b = 8.29055(19) ̊A, c = 8.20103(14) ̊A for 230 K). Nevertheless, very weak superstructure reflections were observed for this minor phase, which could prove that the real structure was similar to that reported earlier for stoichiometric LiMn2O4 [29]. TheresultsofRietveldrefinementforthepattern,collected at 140 K, are shown in Fig. 3 and the resulting structural parameters are shown in Table 3. One can see that the tetragonal structure can be satisfactorily described with the space group F41/ddm. Atomic coordinates for cation positions are: Li, Fig. 5.

An anisotropic dependence of the unit-cell parameters on temperature, for the tetragonal phase differs from that observed for orthorhombic phase.Thecparameterofthetetragonalphaseincreasesfaster than a and b parameters. On the other hand, in the orthorhombic phase the most sensitive on the temperature changes is the b parameter [30]. The lowering of symmetry, both in the orthorhombic phase and in the tetragonal phase, is caused by the cooperative Jahn–Teller effect, but with the different orientation and distribution of Mn3+ ions.

Piszora / Journal of Alloys and Compounds 401 (2005) 34–40 phase transition occurs in very wide temperature range, from ∼240 to ∼320 K (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, the variation of the c/a ratio precedes the structure transformation and can be observed in the temperature region of 110–300 K (Fig. 7). 4. Summary Results of the synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that lithium deficient sample, heated up to 1173 K, maintains cubic structure, but it transforms to the tetragonal phase, when cooled down below room temperature. Therefore, the quenching procedure, which was very often used to examine the high temperature structures in ambient conditions, does not preserve the high temperature structure, but only retains the high temperature valence of manganese. It is most interesting that the deficit of only 0.02 Li in formula Li1−xMn2+xO4 (or 0.7% of total cations) can involve the phase transition and it is absolutely surprising that further lithium deficit ∼0.10 Li lead to completely different phase transition. An explication of sensitivity of the Li1−xMn2+xO4 system to chemical composition has been given recently [16], moreover, certain additional theoretical calculations are in progress. The current paper deals with only one sample of the whole LixMn2+xO4 series. More generalization will be possible after more detailed investigations of the whole series of lithium-deficient samples. Presented results encourage to a revision of the phase diagram of the Li–Mn–O system, and as the author believes, they accelerate the exploitation of the lithium–manganese spinel.

By refining the X-ray diffraction patterns with Rietveld profile analysis, the lattice parameters, interatomic distances and cation ̊ ̊ distribution were determined. The Fe-for-Mn substitution increases the spinel unit-cell constant from 8.21A to 8.34A for the Fe/(Fe1Mn) mole ratio of 0 and 1, respectively. A distinct departure from Vegard’s law appears for Fe/(Fe1Mn)$0.6. The additional ‘superstructure’ reflections on the X-ray patterns confirm an ordering of lithium ions in octahedral sites, bringing about the lowering of Fd3m symmetry to 1 the P4 32/P4 32 space group. Li ions are distributed over both octahedral and tetrahedral cationic positions of spinel lattice, although 1 3 1 the end-members of the solid solution series, LiMn O and Li Fe O , contain Li coordinated tetrahedrally and octahedrally, 2 4 0.5 2.5 4 respectively. 1 31 The ordering of Li ions in the 4b Wyckoff’s positions of a cubic primitive unit cell (P4 32/P4 32), observed for the increasing Fe 1 3 content, has been confirmed for that system with infrared spectroscopy. The number of infrared active vibrations increases significantly 1 with the lowering of crystal symmetry caused by the 1:3 ordering of Li in octahedral sites. 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Spinels Renaissance: The past, present, and future of those ubiquitous minerals and materials Bond-length fluctuation in the orthorhombic 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure of LiMn2O4 spinel†k Nobuo Ishizawa1,*, Kenji Tateishi2, Shuji Oishi3 and Shunji Kishimoto4 1Advanced Ceramics Research Center, Nagoya Institute of Technology, 10-6-29 Asahigaoka, Tajimi, 507-0071, Japan 2Gifu Prefectural Ceramics Research Institute, 3-11 Hoshigadai, Tajimi, Gifu 507-0811, Japan 3Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 380-8553, Japan 4Institute of Materials Structure Science, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, 1-1 Oho, Tsukuba 305-0801, Japan Abstract Single-crystal synchrotron X‐ray diffraction experiments are conducted on spinel-type LiMn2O4 at 230 and 320 K to investigate the effect of charge disproportionation of Mn ions on phase transition near room temperature. The orthorhombic 3ac × 3ac × 1ac superstructure of the low-temperature form, where “ac” is the ideal cubic cell edge, has a network of Mn4+ ions at the vertices of a slightly distorted truncated square tessellation comprising one square and two octagonal prisms; the square prism and one type of octagonal prism house Mn3+ ions with Jahn-Teller (JT) elongated Mn–O bonds almost parallel to the c and b axes, respectively, whereas the other octagonal prism houses Mn ions with JT-induced bond-length fluctuation for the Mn–O bonds lying almost parallel to the a axis. The Mn ions in the latter octagonal prism are assumed to exchange their oxidation states dynamically between 3+ and 4+ in a time ratio of ~3:1, forming a polaron centered at a Mn4O4 heterocubane cluster with orbital and spin orders. The high-temperature cubic form contains an inherent positional disordering of oxygen ions. The effect of the molecular polarons on the phase transition mechanism is discussed on the basis of a spin blockade in the form of truncated square tessellation. Keywords: Lithium manganese oxide, LiMn2O4, low-temperature form, bond-length fluctuation, molecular polaron, spin blockade, phase transition, Mn4O4 heterocubane Introduction Lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) undergoes a first-order structural phase transition near room temperature (Yamada and Tanaka 1995). The high-temperature form is an AB2O4 spineltype with a normal cationic configuration, where A, B, and O are also designated as the tetrahedral and octahedral cation sites and oxygen ion site, having cubic Fd3m symmetry with a unit-cell dimension ac ≈ 8.3 Å. The low-temperature form crystallizes in orthorhombic Fddd symmetry, having unit-cell dimensions along a and b approximately triple that of the high-temperature prototype. This 3ac × 3ac × 1ac (hereafter abbreviated as 3 × 3 × 1) superstructure was first identified by a neutron powder diffrac­ tion and electron microscopy study (Rodríguez-Carvajal et al. 1998), and confirmed later by single-crystal synchrotron X‐ray diffraction (Tateishi et al. 2004b). This phase transition accompanies a charge disproportion­ ation of Mn atoms occupying the octahedral B sites of the AB2O4 spinel. Since the mean oxidation state of Mn in LiMn2O4 is +3.5, the simplest scheme would be a disproportionation into Mn3+ and Mn4+ in equal fractions. However, the spinel-type structure, where the B-site ions are located at the nodes of a corner-linked tetrahedral network, does not allow alternative charge-ordering topologies, such as –Mn3+–Mn4+– Mn3+–Mn4+–, which have been more extensively studied for Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions at the B sites in magnetite with an inverse spinel-type structure, iv(Fe3+)vi[Fe3+ 1/2Fe2+ 1/2]2O4 (Verwey and de Boer 1936; Verwey and Haayman 1941; Sasaki 1997; Senn et al. 2012). The structural complexity of the low-temperature LiMn2O4 thus arises from frustrated charge disproportionation on the tetrahedral B-site network, which has not been fully solved to date. This paper reports the novel occurrence of a bond-length fluctuation in selected Mn–O bonds within the 3 × 3 × 1 super­ structure of LiMn2O4, which can be interpreted as evidence of a dynamical charge exchange between 3+ and 4+ among the cor­ responding Mn ions. Although this phenomenon is considered an inherent characteristic of the low-temperature phase of LiMn2O4, the previous structure determination (Tateishi et al. 2004b) failed owing to a subtle alteration of the diffraction intensities, as ex­ pected from a complicated structure comprising 504 atoms at 18 crystallographically independent sites in a unit cell of ~5000 Å3 in size. By utilizing a smaller crystal (~0.03 mm in size) with high-flux synchrotron X‐rays to reduce the extinction problem, and a data collection strategy at significantly higher resolution (d > 0.49 Å) at a lower temperature (230 K) than used in the previous experiment (~0.05 mm, d > 0.63 Å, and 297 K), the present study is able to analyze unusual vibrational behavior at two oxygen ion sites via the split atom model. Experimental detection of bond-length fluctuation in the Mn–O bonds indicates that an exchange in oxidation states of Mn between 3+ and 4+ occurs, because the Mn3+ in a high-spin American Mineralogist, Volume 99, pages 1528–1536, 2014 0003-004X/14/0809–1528$05.00/DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2138/am.2014.4840 1528 * E-mail: ishizawa@nitech.ac.jp †kOpen access: Article available to all readers online.

The wavelength of the X‐rays emitted from the vertical wiggler was calibrated using a silicon single crystal to be 0.75064 Å at 230 K and 0.75059 Å at the other temperatures, including 320 K. The crystallography program packages Xtal (Hall et al. 2002) and Jana2006 (Petricek et al. 2006) were used for data processing and structure refinement, respectively. An extinction correction was applied according to Becker and Cop­ pens formalism (Becker and Coppens 1974). The anomalous scattering factors and the X‐ray absorption coefficients at the experimental wavelength were taken from the Sasaki tables (Sasaki 1989, 1990). The values of the BVSs were calculated according to Brown and Altermatt (1985) with their parameter values. The com­ puter programs Diamond (Brandenburg and Putz 2005) and Vesta (Momma and Izumi 2011) were used for visualization of crystal structures and volumetric data. Figure 1. Phase transition temperatures and changes in cell dimensions with temperature: (a) phase transition temperatures (open circles) of the present crystal superimposed on changes of the volume fraction of the high-temperature cubic phase with temperature (gray curve), given in Figure 4 of the paper by Rousse et al. (1999b), and (b) changes in cell dimensions during cooling (open circles on gray curves) obtained in the present study, in comparison with dotted data given in Figure 9 of the paper by Rousse et al. (1999b) during heating. The estimated uncertainties are approximately equal to the size of circles. state electronic configuration (t3 2ge1 g) is stabilized in an elongated tetragonal dipyramid as a result of the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion, in contrast with Mn4+ (t3 2ge0 g), which is stabilized in a relatively regular coordination octahedron (Moore and Janes 2004). The oxidation state can be estimated from the bond valence sum (BVS), which is a function of bond-length and number of bonds in the coordination sphere, using two empirical parameters (Brown 2002). If charge disproportionation occurs dynamically, then experimental detection of bond-length fluctuation and its separation into each component are thus essential in discussing the oxidation states of Mn, and, accordingly, the phase transi­ tion mechanism of the compound, which is mentioned in the Discussion section. In addition, the Mn–O bond-length fluctuation appears to have a close relationship with the transport property of Li in the high-temperature form, which can be more broadly extended to “cubically stabilized Lix(Mn,M)2O4–d (M = Mg, Co, etc.),” a well-known candidate compound for a cathode material used in the Li ion battery (Park et al. 2010). The present study con­ firmed the structure model for the 1 × 1 × 1 high-temperature form first proposed by Takahashi et al. (2003), in which the oxygen ions are distributed statically at the Wyckoff 96g site of the space group Fd3m, in contrast with the widely used model that assumes the oxygen ions lie at the 32e site. In addition, it is pointed out that even the 96g model has a drawback in fully explaining the disordered distribution of Mn–O distances: an alternative model assuming the anharmonic vibration of oxygen ions, is also proposed. Experimental procedures Reagent-grade Li2CO3 and MnCO3 were weighed and combined together to form a nominal 7 mol% LiMn2O4 mixture. Approximately 31.7 g of the mixture was placed in a platinum crucible and heated to 1373 K at a rate of 45 K/h in an air atmosphere. The peak temperature was maintained for 10 h, and then reduced to 723 K at 5 K/h with subsequent furnace-cooling by turning off the power. The flux was rinsed out with warm water. The crystals were black and octahedrally shaped, with a maximum size of approximately 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm3. The stoichiometric composition for the crystal is assumed as detailed in the Results section. Preliminary single-crystal diffraction experiments were conducted using a three-circle imaging-plate diffractometer (Rigaku Rapid) with MoKa X‐rays. The phase transition temperature was determined by examining the appearance of superstructure reflections in oscillation photographs about the three principal axes of the high-temperature cubic form. During the cooling procedure, the [100] oscillation photograph at 295 K did not show any superstructure reflections, whereas they are clearly recorded in the next photograph taken at 293 K. The transition temperature of the sample during cooling was thus determined to be 294(1) K. Since it took approximately 10 min to decrease the temperature from 295 to 293 K, the mean cooling rate during transition was 0.2 K min–1. The time required to take an oscil­ lation photograph at a constant temperature was approximately 40 min. In a similar way, the transition temperature during heating was determined to be 310(1) K. The synchrotron experiment was carried out at beamline 14A at the Photon Factory of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, using a horizontal-type four-circle diffractometer (Satow and Iitaka 1989; Vaalsta and Hester 1997). The sample was first warmed, using a nitrogen gas stream, to 320 K, at which point the data collection was carried out over three days. The sample was then cooled at a rate of 2 K min–1 to 230 K, at which point another data collection was carried over four days. Cell dimensions were calculated at these temperatures from 24 reflections at 2q ≈ 86°. The cooling procedure from 320 to 230 K was interrupted several times to calculate cell dimensions at intermediate temperatures of 300, 280, and 250 K, using 12 reflections at 2q ≈ 56° and 2q ≈ 66°. Intensity data were collected for the hemisphere of reciprocal space in the range 1° < 2q < 100° at 230 K, and the full sphere in the range 1° < 2q < 130° at 320 K. An F lattice centering was assumed for both data collections according to the previous study (Tateishi et al. 2004b).

(1999b). A small difference in bo/3 just below the transition point could be ascribed to the experimental method; the single-crystal sample of 0.03 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm3 used in the present study remained a mono-domain (no twinning) during cooling across the transition, and the profile decomposition analysis employed in the powder diffraction method was not required in the present study. Low-temperature form at 230 K Crystal data for LiMn2O4 at 230 K and a summary of the refinements are given in Table 2. Final atomic positions and atomic displacement parameters are given in Table 3. The ori­ gin of the space group Fddd was chosen at an inversion center (origin choice 2). The structural refinement, assuming an ordered (non-split) atom model (Tateishi et al. 2004b), converged with R/wR = 0.0284/0.0433, using 134 refinable parameters for 3313 reflections, which have an observed diffraction intensity larger than three times the estimated standard uncertainty [I > 3s(I)]. The occupation parameters of the nine O sites were also examined simultaneously, but no significant deviation from unity was detected; they were 0.989(8), 0.977(8), 0.986(8), Results Phase-transition temperatures and cell dimensions The transition temperatures of 294(1) and 310(1) K, deter­ mined from the appearance and disappearance of superstructure reflections during cooling and heating, respectively, are plotted in Figure 1a. These values were very close to the onset and endpoint of the changes in volume fraction of the highand lowtemperature forms observed by the neutron powder diffraction (Rousse et al. 1999b). Cell dimensions (ao, bo, and co for the or­ thorhombic low-form, and ac for the cubic high-form) at various temperatures during cooling are given in Table 1, and plotted in Figure 2.

Hereafter, the Mn coordination sphere including O4a and/or O9a is denoted as “a-type” and the sphere including O9b and/or O4b is denoted as “b-type”. The Mn–O bond lengths and the BVSs are summarized in Table 5. As discussed later, the lengths are listed only for the a-type and b-type, and not for the combination. The distribution of Mn–O bond lengths is illustrated in Figure 3. The crystallographic infor­ mation file (CIF) of the 230 K data set is available as a deposit1. High-temperature form at 320 K Assuming the ideal spinel-type atomic arrangement for the stoichiometric LiMn2O4, i.e., Li at 8a (1/8, 1/8, 1/8), Mn at 16d (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), and O at 32e (x, x, x), where x = 0.2634 in Fd3m, the harmonic refinement converged with R/wR = 0.0245/0.0401 for 208 reflections with I >3s(I) using eight parameters. If the nonstoichiometry of oxygen ions was taken into consideration, then the refinement converged with R/wR = 0.0254/0.0399 for 208 reflections with I >3s(I) using nine parameters. The occu­ 1.001(8), 0.981(8), 0.988(8), 1.003(8), 0.996(8), and 1.001(9) for O1 through O9, respectively. However, the anisotropic atomic displacement parameter (ADP) ellipsoids of O9 and O4 were extraordinarily elongated toward a, as shown in Figure 2a. The ratios of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues (U3/U1) of the O9 and O4 ellipsoids are 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, which is in contrast to the other more moderate values, which ranged between 1.35 and 2.65; these are given in Table 4. A comparison between the ADP ellipsoids shows that the maximum eigenval­ ues U3 for O9 and O4 remain almost unchanged by cooling the crystal from 297 to 230 K, whereas all the other eigenvalues are reduced by approximately half. The difference Fourier synthesis eliminating O9 or O4 for phasing resulted in an asymmetric electron density distribution along a direction almost parallel to the a axis, suggesting a possible positional disorder owing to the bond-length fluctuation of Mn2–O9 and Mn2–O4. Assuming the split atom model as shown in Figure 2b, and employing O9a/O9b instead of O9, and O4a/O4b instead of O4, further refinements converged with lower R/wR values (0.0279/0.0430) using a lower number of refinable parameters (132). In the course of refinement, the same isotropic ADP was assumed for the O9a–O9b split pair, as well as for the O4a–O4b pair, and the sums of the split site populations were assumed to be unity for both pairs. The populations of O9a and O4a converged 1 Deposit item AM-14-804, CIF. Deposit items are stored on the MSA web site and available via the American Mineralogist Table of Contents.

These results suggested that the harmonic 96g and/or the anharmonic 32e models are more appropriate for describing the high-temperature form than the conventional harmonic 32e model. The d value in LiMn2O4–d estimated from the population refinement of the oxygen deficiency became –0.06(4) for both the harmonic 96g and anharmonic 32e models, in contrast with 0.12(8) for the harmonic 32e model. It should be noted that the d value in the former two models was much closer to null than that in the latter, as discussed later. The stoichiometric composition (i.e., d = 0) was thus assumed for the present crystal. The 96g model gives 1.974(2) Å for the Li–O bond length, and two different bond lengths of 2.070(3) and 1.913(1) Å for Mn–O, in agreement with Takahashi et al. (2003). The frequency ratio of the longer and shorter Mn–O bonds is 1:2, which is imposed by the symmetry of the structure model. The longer and shorter Mn–O bond lengths at 320 K are also compared to the distribution of Mn–O bond lengths in the low-temperature form at 230 K in Figure 3. Crystal data and selected structural parameters of the har­ monic 96g model of the high-temperature form are given in Table 2. Full information about the harmonic 96g and the anharmonic 32e models using the thirdand fourth-order expansions, respec­ tively, are given consecutively as a deposit1. Discussion Oxidation state of manganese The oxidation states of Mn1 and Mn3 are essentially +3 as seen from the BVSs in Table 5. This agrees well with what would be expected from the existence of typical pseudo-tetragonal JT pation parameter of the oxygen ion site converged at 0.970(19), which corresponds to d = 0.12(8) in the expression LiMn2O4–d. Relatively large positive and negative residual electrons of ±1.2 e Å–3 were found at positions 0.3–0.4 Å apart from the O site, which could be ascribed to either positional disorder or the anharmonic vibrational nature of the oxygen ion. Further refine­ ment was carried out, assuming the oxygen ion with harmonic vibration lay at the Wyckoff 96g site with 1/3 site occupancy, and converged with R/wR = 0.0117/0.0159 using 11 parameters. Other models assuming anharmonic vibration of the oxygen ion at the 32e site were also examined. Refinements using the third-order Gram-Charlier series expansion for the oxygen ion converged with R/wR = 0.0134/0.0188 using 11 parameters, and those using up to the fourth-order terms converged with R/ wR = 0.0117/0.0157 using 15 parameters. The R factors of the harmonic 96g and the anharmonic 32e models were significantly lower than those of the harmonic 32e model. In addition, there were negligibly few residual electrons near the O sites in the former two models and distribution of electrons did not form Table 5.—Continued Atom pairs O4a and O9a O4b and O9b Li1–O1 1.9726(14) Li1–O1i 1.9726(14) Li1–O1vii 1.9726(14) Li1–O1ix 1.9726(14) Mean 1.973 1.973 BVS 1.02(1) 1.02(1) Li2–O2ii 1.994(3) Li2–O2 x 1.994(3) Li2–O3iii 1.976(3) Li2–O3viii 1.976(3) Mean 1.985 1.985 BVS 0.98(1) 0.98(1) Li3–O4iii 1.980(6) 2.022(11) Li3–O4 x 1.980(6) 2.022(11) Li3–O7 2.027(3) Li3–O7v 2.027(3) Mean 2.004 2.025 BVS 0.94(1) 0.88(1) Li4–O5i 1.957(5) Li4–O6 x 1.957(5) Li4–O8viii 1.932(5) Li4–O9viii 1.914(5) 2.011(6) Mean 1.940 1.964 BVS 1.11(1) 1.04(1) Notes: Distances related to the split atom sites (a, b) for O4 and O9 are given in separate columns where duplication is suppressed.

The JT-elongated bonds lie almost parallel to c for Mn1 and to b for Mn3. On the other hand, Mn4 and Mn5 are essentially +4, as seen from the BVSs in Table 5. This is also consistent with the shape of the coordination octahedra, having almost equidistant Mn–O bonds with a mean of ~1.91 Å (Table 5 and Fig. 3). The split atom sites, O4a and O4b, are also involved in the Mn4–O bonds, which vary between 1.883(4) and 1.942(7) Å, depending on the split atom positions, though they do not elongate to a large degree like the Mn3+ JT bond of ~2.2 Å because the split occurs almost tangentially to the Mn4 coordination sphere. The differ­ ence in the mean Mn4–O bond distance between the aand b-type Mn4 octahedra is as marginal as ~0.01 Å, suggesting an invariable nature of the oxidation state for Mn4 against the O site splits. All these data support the fact that Mn cations at the Mn1 and Mn3 sites are primarily 3+, and those at Mn4 and Mn5 sites are primarily 4+, which is in agreement with the results by Rodríguez-Carvajal et al. (1998) and Tateishi et al. (2004b). Contrary to the tangential case for Mn4, the oxidation state of Mn2 is significantly affected by the O site splits because the split occurs nearly radially for the Mn2 coordination. If the oxy­ gen ions occupy the O9a and O4a sites to form the a-type Mn2 octahedron, then the shape of the Mn2O6 octahedron is deformed like Mn13+or Mn33+-bearing octahedra, except that the two JTelongated Mn2–O9a and Mn2–O4a bonds of ~2.2 Å lie almost parallel to a (Fig. 2b and Table 5). The BVS of +3.25 also favors the oxidation state of 3+ for Mn2. On the other hand, if the oxy­ gen ions occupy the O9b and O4b sites to form the b-type Mn2 octahedron, four of the six Mn2–O bonds are altered so that they become very similar in length to each other, having a mean of ~1.95 Å (Table 5). Therefore, the oxidation state of Mn2 in the b-type Mn2 octahedron is assumed to be 4+. The calculated BVS of +3.58 for the b-type Mn2 octahedron is slightly lower than the assumed value (4+). This could be ascribed to the geometrical constraint in the second coordination sphere of Mn2, as shown in Figure 2b. The O4 atom pairs surrounding the Mn24O94 heterocubane are capped by Li3 at the top and bottom ends along a. A shortening of Mn2-O4b, therefore, induces an elongation of Li3–O4b to 2.02 Å, resulting in the longest mean Li–O (2.03 Å) and the smallest BVS (+0.88) for Li3. This length is considerably longer and the BVS is considerably smaller than those of the other Li ions (1.94–1.99 Å and +0.98–1.11), as given in Table 5. This could be the reasons why Mn24+–O4b (1.97 Å) cannot contract to the same level as Mn24+–O9b (1.95 Å), and, accordingly, the calculated BVS for Mn24+ (+3.58) does not reach the expected value of +4. The ideal disproportionation scheme for Mn2 can be summa­ rized as follows: when its octahedron is of the a-type, the oxidation state of Mn2 is 3+, and when its octahedron is of the b-type, the oxidation state of Mn2 is 4+. This scheme explains the virtually identical population ratios of O9a/O9b and O4a/O4b obtained by the structural refinements, because the two oxygen ions are displaced from O4b and O9b to O4a and O9a, respectively, by the JT elongation at the same time that the oxidation state of the central Mn2 turns into 3+, and the reverse takes place when Mn2 turns into 4+. The refined populations of the O9 and O4 split pairs thus directly indicate the probabilities of the two oxidation states of Mn2, i.e., a 3+ oxidation state for Mn2 is 62% and that of 4+ is 38%, leading to an oxidation state for Mn2 of +3.38, as an average over time and space. This ideal charge disproportionation scheme can be examined in light of the charge neutrality principle of the crystal. The number of Mn sites in the 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure containing 72 LiMn2O4 chemical units in a unit cell is 16 for Mn1 and 32 for each of Mn2, Mn3, Mn4, and Mn5. The assumed oxidation states of 3+ for all Mn1 and Mn3 sites, and 4+ for all Mn4 and Mn5 sites result in the oxidation state of +3.25 for Mn2. This value corresponds to a state in which the Mn24O94 heterocubane structure consists of three Mn23+ and one Mn24+, i.e., a 3:1 ratio. The percentage of Mn23+ (75%) is slightly larger than the experimentally obtained value of 62%, although the estimated standard uncertainty of 2–5% may partially account for the difference. Molecular polaron with bond-length fluctuation The split of the O9 and O4 atom sites owing to JT distortion along a, and the disproportionation scheme for Mn2 into 75% Mn3+ and 25% Mn4+ could be modeled into the formation of a molecular polaron with bond-length fluctuation, as illustrated in Figure 4. The four Mn2 ions in the Mn24O94 heterocubane structure with a ground state of t3 2ge1 g (Mn3+ with a high-spin electronic configura­ tion) have an orbital order such that the half-occupied d(3x2 – r2) orbital is directed nearly parallel to a, with one hole shared among them, enabling bond-length fluctuation along it.

This is essentially a “truncated square tessellation,” among the eight semiregular ones (Grunbaum and Shephard 1987). The square prism of the tessellation houses an array of Mn13+ parallel to c with JT elongation almost parallel to c. The one octagonal prism houses Mn33+ about the twofold screw axis parallel to c, whereas the other octagonal prism houses the Mn24O4 heterocubane centered at the Wyckoff 8b sites of Fddd, having point symmetry of 222. The former Mn33+-bearing octagonal prism is elongated along b owing to the JT distortion almost parallel to this direction, whereas the latter Mn2-bearing octagonal prism is elongated along a to a lesser extent, owing to JT-induced bond-length fluctuation almost parallel to this direction. If all the Mn2 is 3+ similar to Mn33+, then the degrees of JT distortions along a and b should become the same. The 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure would then exhibit the truncated square tessellation in its ideally tetragonal form, which contradicts the metrically orthorhombic nature of the low-temperature form. Conversely, the orthorhombicity of the 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure can be ascribed to the attenuated JT-elongation along a compared with b, owing to a dynamic exchange of the oxidation state of Mn2 between 3+ and 4+, associated with the bond-length fluctuation. Role of polarons in the orthorhombic–cubic phase transition of LiMn2O4 In the 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure of LiMn2O4, the molecular polaron is centered only at the Mn24O94 heterocubane. The Mn24O94 heterocubane, the following two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the d(3x2 – r2) orbital of the four Mn2 ions in the heterocubane are ordered in the spin state, and (2) the Mn24O94 heterocubane is isolated from its surroundings by the spin blockade (Maignan et al. 2004; Weinmann et al. 1995), which limits the hole hopping strictly to within the heterocubane structure. As shown in Figure 5, Mn4O4 heterocubanes form a cornershared network in the spinel structure. In the 3 × 3 × 1 superstruc­ ture of LiMn2O4, there are four types of heterocubanes: Mn24O94, Mn32Mn42O32O62, Mn32Mn52O72O82, and Mn1Mn2Mn4 Mn5O1O2O4O5. The Mn24O94 heterocubane is corner-linked to the four Mn1Mn2Mn4Mn5O1O2O4O5 heterocubanes via Mn2. Therefore, Mn13+, Mn44+, and Mn54+ should be in the opposite spin state to Mn2 to establish the spin blockade for at least the nearest Mn–Mn neighbors. Since Mn33+ is not included in any of the four heterocubanes corner-linked to Mn24O94, it still retains freedom in its spin state. A precise and accurate neutron diffraction study would be necessary for further discussion of the spin states of Mn in the 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure. The Mn–O bond-length fluctuation is expected to occur in Mnbearing perovskite-type oxides by the superexchange interaction (Goodenough et al. 2003), where oxygen forms an ~180° bridge between two adjacent Mn ions. To the best of the authors’ knowl­ edge, this study has shown the first experimental evidence of the occurrence of bond-length fluctuations in Mn-bearing spinel-type oxides with an ~90° bridge, although Yamada et al. (1979) first suspected that the Fe4O4 heterocubane in magnetite behaves as a molecular polaron.

(1998) reported that the Mn–O bond lengths were 2.23 and 1.92 Å at 300 K in the high-form of LiMn2O4 and the ratio of the lengths remained almost constant over the highand low-forms in the temperature range 200–370 K. These Mn–O bond lengths agree well with those in the low form at 230 K in the present study. However, the longer Mn–O bond length [2.070(3) Å at 320 K] of the 96g model for the high-form is attenuated from the fully elongated Mn3+–O bond (~2.2 Å) in the low form (Fig. 3), as well as the longer Mn–O bond length (2.23 Å at 300 K) in the high form reported by Yamaguchi et al. (1998). This attenuation appears to arise from the symmetry constraint of the 96g model of Fd3m, which imposes the 4:8 ratio upon the number of longer and shorter Mn–O bonds per two Mn octahedra in LiMn2O4, though the ratio should be approximately 2:10, as Yamaguchi et al. (1998) assumed in their EXAFS study using the three-shell model. On the other hand, the anharmonic 32e model is advantageous in describing a dynamical variation of the Mn–O bond length, as shown in Figure 7, although the variation can only be visualized by the probability density function of oxygen atoms calculated from the inverse Fourier transform of their anharmonic ADPs. A common feature about the oxygen ion disorder in the highand low forms (Fig. 7) is that the oxygen ions are distributed with three main extrusions grasping the circumsphere of the LiO4 tetrahedron along the directions to stay further from adjacent manganese ions. This similarity about the oxygen ion disordering across the two forms is consistent with the transition mechanism of LiMn2O4, as stated in the previous section. The nearly stoichiometric composition of the present crystal agrees with the studies by Rousse et al. (1999a, 1999b), in which d was determined to be 0.028(26) by the redox titration. The oxygen deficiency of almost null obtained from the harmonic 96g and anharmonic 32e models is consistent with the stoichio­ metric composition. In contrast to this, the oxygen deficiency (d) tends to be evaluated excessively in the harmonic 32e model, as mentioned in the Results section. Oxygen ions are statically and/ or dynamically displaced from the ideal 32e site in an irregular shape, as shown Figure 7. Therefore, it is possible that the popu­ lation analysis based on the conventional harmonic 32e model polarons are confined in one type of the octagonal prism in the truncated square tessellation of Mn4+ ions with spin states opposite to that of Mn2. Note that the Mn33+ ions in the other octagonal prism do not form the heterocubane cluster by themselves, but are aligned like a spiral staircase about the twofold screw axis in the prism (Fig. 6). Since the high-temperature form of LiMn2O4 has an cubic unit cell of the spinel-type, manganese atoms are expected to have spin and orbital freedoms. The spin blockade achieved by the formation of the truncated square tessellation is broken in the high-temperature form, allowing a free migra­ tion of polarons. The cubic–orthorhombic phase transition of LiMn2O4 near room temperature can thus be regarded as an order–disorder transition of the molecular polarons centered at the Mn4O4 heterocubanes. This picture appears to have close re­ lationships with the polaron melting and ordering in the first-order phase transition of the perovskite-type manganite, Pr1–xCaxMnO3 (0.32 ≤ x ≤ 0.5), reported by Jooss et al. (2007). High-temperature form The present study revealed a positional disordering of the oxygen ions in the high-temperature form. The disorder can be modeled into the harmonically vibrating split-atom model (the 96g model) or the anharmonically vibrating 32e model, as men­ tioned in the Results section. These two models have benefits and drawbacks, although the 96g model is practically useful for studies using the powder diffraction technique, in which the anharmonic refinement is often inapproachable. A drawback of the 96g model is the attenuated length of the longer Mn–O bond, as shown in Figure 3. From the EXAFS study Mn13+ Mn2 Mn33+ Mn44+ Mn54+ 5/8 3/8 1/8 7/8 5/8 1/8 7/8 3/8 a b ao Figure 6.

In this respect, it is necessary to reexamine the relationship between the transition temperatures and oxygen vacancies (d) reported by Kanno et al. (2001), Tachibana et al. (2003), and Yonemura et al. (2004), because the d values in these studies were determied by the Rietveld refinement based on the harmonic 32e model. Implications The high-temperature form of LiMn2O4 is a central component of the cubically stabilized series of Lix(Mn,M)2O4–d (M = Mg, Co, etc., 0 ≤ x ≤ 2), which is known as a Li-ion conductor (Park et al. 2010). The Li ion migration is widely believed to occur along the zigzagging pathway connecting the Wyckoff 8a and 16c sites of Fd3m; the former is the tetrahedral A site and the latter is the vacant octahedral site in the normal AB2O4 spinel (Tateishi et al. 2004a). Therefore, the static and dynamic distortions of the trian­ gular oxygen ion bottleneck at the interface of the AO4 tetrahedron and the adjacent O6 octahedron are of great importance in Li ion migration. The bond-length fluctuation of the Mn4O4 heterocubane and its migration as a polaron in the high-temperature phase of LiMn2O4 would be advantageous in opening the bottleneck of the O triangle, because the fluctuation directly affects the positions of oxygen ions forming the bottleneck, as shown in Figure 2b. In practical applications, however, attention should be paid to the distribution in time and space of the oxidation states of Mn, because it may vary depending on x and d, and probably tends to cluster easily, which seriously affects the performance of the Li conduction. As an example, the present study shows that the poor transport property in the 3 × 3 × 1 superstructure of LiMn2O4, as inferred by Tateishi et al. (2004a), can be ascribed to the formation of the truncated square tessellation of Mn4+, which immobilizes polarons via the spin blockade.

Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis of the low temperature form of LiMn2O4 Junji Akimoto*, Yasuhiko Takahashi, Norihito Kijima, Yoshito Gotoh National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8565, Japan Received 09 November 2003; received in revised form 30 January 2004; accepted 30 January 2004 Abstract Crystal structure of the low temperature form of LiMn2O4 has been successfully determined by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data at 130 K. It belongs to the orthorhombic system, space group Fddd with a = 24.750(3) A ̊ , b = 24.801(2) A ̊ , c = 8.1903(9) A ̊ , and V = 5027.4(9) A ̊ 3. The structure, including anisotropic displacement parameters for each atom, was refined to the conventional values R1 = 5.58%, wR2 = 7.16%, and S = 1.180 for 8082 independent reflections. The oxygen sublattice deformation toward the [1 1 0] direction in the low temperature form is clearly observed at 130 K. The structural phase transition around 280 and 320 K was precisely examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements using the single-crystal samples.

Introduction In the past few years, the lithium transition metal oxides such as LiCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiMn2O4 have been extensively studied as cathode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, since these can be reversibly deintercalated and reintercalated by lithium ions at high potential. Recently, special attention has been paid to the spinel-type lithium manganates due to its economical and environmental advantages [1]. LiMn2O4 presents a first order structural transition around room temperature [2]. Above the transition temperature, it has the cubic spinel structure with Fd3 ̄m space group. The crystal structure of the low temperature form has been recently investigated with the orthorhombic symmetry and Fddd space group by using the neutron powder diffraction method [3]. However, the mechanism of structural transition has not been clarified yet. Recently, we have succeeded in the synthesis of LiMn2O4 single crystals by a flux method [4,5], and revealed the precise crystal and electronic structures of the cubic LiMn2O4 [4,6]. In this paper, we demonstrate the precise crystal structure determination of low temperature form of LiMn2O4 by single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. 2. Experimental and results 2.1. Crystal characterization Single crystals of the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 were grown by a flux method, as reported recently [4–7]. Black, octahedral single crystals of about 0.20  0.20  0.20 mm3 in the maximum size were obtained. Chemical analysis using selected single crystals, carried out by SEM–EDX (JEOL JSM-5400) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, confirmed the stoichiometric chemical composition; the result was consistent with that of the structure refinement. The density of LiMn2O4, measured using a few single-crystal specimens and Clerici’s heavy fluid, is 4.29 F 0.01 g/cm3 at 300 K; this value is consistent with the calculated value (4.286 g/cm3). This fact allows one to conclude that the present LiMn2O4 0167-2738/$ see front matter D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ssi.2004.01.051 * Corresponding author.

The phase transition was confirmed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (SEIKO DSC6200). Fig. 1 shows the DSC curves of the present LiMn2O4 single-crystal samples (9.51 mg). The transitions were observed around 280 and 320 K; the result is well consistent with those reported using powder samples [3,8,9]. The crystal symmetry and structural data were examined by the precession camera and an automated fourcircle X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku AFC-7S), respectively. Temperature dependence of the lattice parameters for LiMn2O4 single crystals between 100 and 330 K was precisely investigated on the four-circle diffractometer using a nitrogen gas flow cryostat. The structural phase transition around 300 K has been also confirmed by the temperature dependence of integrated peak intensity for the superlattice (2/3 10/3 0) reflection observed in the low temperature orthorhombic form (Fig. 2). 2.2. Structure analysis A small octahedral crystal of LiMn2O4, 0.15  0.15 0.15 mm in size, was used for the intensity data collection. The intensity data were collected by the 2h  x scan mode with a scan rate of 2 j/min at 130, 200, and 330 K on the four-circle diffractometer (operating conditions: 50 kV, 30 mA) using graphite-monochromatized MoKa radiation (k = 0.71073 A ̊ ). Absorption corrections were performed using the XTAL3.4 program [10]. As previously reported by us [4,5], the crystal was in the orthorhombic symmetry at low temperatures with the 3a  3a  a superstructure, and splitting of main Bragg Fig. 1.

Akimoto et al. / Solid State Ionics 172 (2004) 491–494 492 reflections was clearly observed because of the formation of mainly three twin components inside the crystal. However, by slow cooling rate of 0.05 K/min, we have successfully measured the intensity data of mainly single domain specimen with the orthorhombic symmetry in the present study. In the structure analysis of low temperature form that followed, the reported space group of Fddd, confirmed by successful refinement, was adopted. The refinement was initiated using the reported coordination model [3]. Further oxygen population refinements were applied for all oxygen sites. However, such a deficient model did not improve the R values. This is consistent with the density measurement result. Finally, the structure was refined to R1 = 5.58% and wR2 = 7.16%, and S = 1.180 for 8082 reflections using the SHELX-97 program [11]. A summary of the crystallographic and experimental data is given in Table 1. The final atomic coordinates and displacement parameters are given in Tables 2 and 3. 3. Structure description and discussion The crystal structure of LiMn2O4 at 330 K was refined at first using the normal spinel atomic coordinates (Fd3 ̄m space group; Li at the 8a site, Mn at the 16d site, and O at the 32e site), and the obtained structural parameters (a = 8.2455(7) A ̊ , x(O) = 0.26341(14), final R1 = 2.49% using 206 reflections) are in good agreement with the previous reports [3,4,6]. On the other hand, the structure of the low temperature form at 130 K successfully converged to sufficiently good R values, including anisotropic displacement parameters for each atom. The refined structural parameters and bond distances were in good agreement with the original reports by neutron powder data [3] but Table 3 Anisotropic displacement parameters (A ̊ 2) for LiMn2O4 at 130 K Atom U11 U22 U33 U23 U13 U12 Li1 0.006(6) 0.010(5) 0.021(10) 0 0 0 Li2 0.004(4) 0.007(3) 0.011(7) 0  0.001(5) 0 Li3 0.011(5) 0.015(5) 0.010(7)  0.003(5) 0 0 Li4 0.016(4) 0.008(2) 0.007(3) 0.005(3) 0.005(4)  0.001(2) Mn1 0.0058(3) 0.00463(19) 0.0050(3)  0.0005(3)  0.0003(3) 0.0000(2) Mn2 0.00566(16) 0.00565(14) 0.0047(2)  0.00013(19)  0.00049(19)  0.00100(14) Mn3 0.00379(14) 0.00665(13) 0.0048(2)  0.00023(17) 0.00046(18) 0.00003(13) Mn4 0.00455(17) 0.00485(11) 0.0042(3)  0.0001(2) 0.00119(17)  0.00006(13) Mn5 0.00359(15) 0.00437(13) 0.0039(2) 0.00002(16) 0.0000(2) 0.00028(12) O1 0.0051(8) 0.0060(6) 0.0086(10)  0.0027(10)  0.0012(9)  0.0007(6) O2 0.0085(9) 0.0054(6) 0.0048(11) 0.0015(8)  0.0026(10) 0.0021(6) O3 0.0055(9) 0.0141(9) 0.0068(11) 0.0037(11)  0.0007(10) 0.0003(8) O4 0.0153(11) 0.0045(7) 0.0067(13) 0.0005(8)  0.0047(11) 0.0022(7) O5 0.0063(8) 0.0074(7) 0.0079(12)  0.0034(9) 0.0021(10)  0.0001(6) O6 0.0059(8) 0.0066(7) 0.0074(12)  0.0018(9)  0.0006(10) 0.0003(7) O7 0.0044(9) 0.0113(8) 0.0064(12)  0.0011(9)  0.0003(10)  0.0002(7) O8 0.0076(9) 0.0062(7) 0.0029(9) 0.0000(8)  0.0002(9)  0.0018(6) O9 0.0256(14) 0.0062(7) 0.0087(12) 0.0004(10)  0.0001(17) 0.0011(9) Table 4 Selected bond distances (A ̊ ) and bond valence sums (BVS) for LiMn2O4 at 130 K Li1 -O1 1.977(3) Mn2 -O9 1.904(3) -O1I 1.977(3) -O9ix 1.914(3) -O1ii 1.977(3) -O2 1.927(3) -O1iii 1.977(3) -O1i 1.963(4) mean 1.977 -O4i 2.075(4) BVS + 1.00 -O9i 2.115(4) mean 1.983 Li2 -O3iv 1.980(6) BVS + 3.36 -O3v 1.980(6) -O2vi 1.989(6) Mn3 -O3 1.906(4) -O2vii 1.989(6) -O6x 1.939(3) mean 1.985 -O7ii 1.944(4) BVS + 0.98 -O7 1.955(3) -O8 2.151(2) Li3 -O4v 1.989(7) -O3viii 2.172(3) -O4vii 1.989(7) mean 2.011 -O7 2.017(7) BVS + 3.16 -O7viii 2.017(7) mean 2.003 Mn4 -O3iv 1.869(3) BVS + 0.94 -O5i 1.882(3) -O4 1.900(4) Li4 -O9iv 1.922(9) -O6iii 1.924(4) -O8iv 1.924(10) -O6 1.934(2) -O5i 1.950(8) -O1 1.958(3) -O6vii 1.974(10) mean 1.911 mean 1.943 BVS + 3.93 BVS + 1.10 Mn5 -O8ii 1.882(4) Mn1 -O4 1.930(2) -O1 1.901(3) -O4v 1.930(2) -O5i 1.902(3) -O2i 1.969(3) -O8 1.902(2) -O2vi 1.969(3) -O2i 1.936(4) -O5vi 2.157(4) -O7 1.968(2) -O5i 2.157(4) mean 1.915 mean 2.019 BVS + 3.88 BVS + 3.08 Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: (i)  x + 1/4,  y + 1/4, z; (ii)  x + 1/4, y,  z + 1/4; (iii) x,  y + 1/4,  z + 1/4; (iv) x + 1/4,  y + 1/2, z  1/4; (v)  x + 1/2,  y + 1/2,  z + 1; (vi) x + 1/4, y + 1/4,  z + 1; (vii)  x + 1/2, y + 1/4, z  1/4; (viii) x,  y + 3/4,  z + 3/4; (ix) x,  y + 1/4,  z + 5/4; (x) x  1/4, y + 1/4,  z + 1/2. J. Akimoto et al. / Solid State Ionics 172 (2004) 491–494 493 with higher accuracy (Tables 2–4). The valence states for five Mn atoms were estimated by the bond valence [12]. As shown in Fig. 3, the oxygen sublattice deformation toward the [1 1 0] direction in the low temperature form is clearly visible in comparison with the orderly arrangement in the cubic spinel structure. This fact may lead us to an order–disorder scenario of the oxygen sublattice for the structural phase transition of LiMn2O4, as previously indicated by the EXAFS study [13]. References [1] M.M.

262 Zeitschrift fur anorganische und allgemeine Chemie. Band 368. 1969 Zur Kristallstruktur von LiMnOz *) Von G. DITTRICH und R. HOPPE Mit 1 Abbildung Inhaltsiibersicht Aus Pulverdaten wird die Kristallstruktur von LiMnO, abgeleitet. Danach liegt die Raumgruppe C:,--Pm2m vor mit Li in l(a), y = 1/2; Li in l(d), y = 3/4; Mn in l(a), y = 0; Mn in l(d), y = 1/4; 0 in l(b, y = 0,04; 0 in l(b), y = 0,4F; 0 in l(c), y = 0,21; 0 in l(c), y = 0,79. MADELUNG-hteile der Gitterenergie werden hierfiir und fur verschiedene andere Strukturmodelle berechnet und eingehend diskutiert. Summary The crystal structure of LiMnO, has been elucidated by powder work. The space group is C.&--Pm2m with Li in l(a), y = 1/2; Li in l(d) y = 3/4, Mn in l(a), y = 0; Mn in l(d), y == 1/4; 0 in l(b), y = 0.04; 0 in l(b), y = 0.46; 0 in l(c), y = 0.21; 0 in l(c), y = 0.79. MADELUNG Parts of Lattice Energy are calculated and discussed in detail for the served" structure and other related models. Unter den ternaren Oxiden der Alkalimetalle mit den ersten Ubergangselementen Sc-Cu nimmt LiMnO, eine interessante Zwischenstellung ein : Die Verbindungen der dem Mangan vorangehenden Elemente, LiVO, l) und LiCrO,l), gehoren zum a-NaFeOz-Typ2), einer hexagonalen Ordnungsvariante der NaC1-Strukturfamilie. Der ol-LiFeOZ-Typ3), in dem die meisten Verbindungen vom Typ LiM1''02 kristallisieren, ist dagegen eine tetra gonale Ordnungsvariante der gleichen Strukturfamilie. Nun ist bekannt, daI3 LiMnO, = Li,,,Mn,,,O weder kubisch im NaC1-Typ selbst, wie die Mischkristalle Li,Mn,-,O (0 < x < 0,35), noch hexagonal bzw. tetragonal (wie die genannten Ordnungsvarianten des NaC1-Typs) kri*) Vorbericht: Z. anorg. allg.

Nach Pulveraufnahmen liegt vielmehr eine orthorhombische Elementarzelle vor. Uber die Anordnung der Teilchen in der Zelle ist nichts bekaant. Vermutet wurde, daI3 die auffallige Abweichung auf den JAHNTELLER-Effekt zuruckgeht, der auch die Struktur von z.B. und y-MnOOH ') maI3geblich bestimmt. Es erschien reizvoll, von dieser Konzeption und den bekannten Gitterkonstanten ausgehend, ein Strukturmodell fiir LiMnO, zu entwerfen, das dem Verlauf der beobachteten Intensitaten der Pulverreflexe entspricht. I. Darstellung und Eigenschaften der Proben Innige Gemenge von Li,O und Mn,O, (Li: Mn = 1: 1) wurden in einem fest verschlossenen Silberbombchen, aus dem zuvor die Luft durch 0,-freies Argon verdrlngt worden war, unter Argon (75OoC, 3 Tage) erhitzt. Man schreckte die Bombchen anschlieBend an der Luft ab. Auch aus Li,O, und MnO bildete sich LiMnO, glatt4). Man erhielt braunschwarze, nicht hygroskopische Proben, die in Wasser schwerloslich sind. Eine hydrolytische Zersetzung tritt praktisch nicht ein. An der Luft findet bei Raumtemperatur keine, beim fZbergieBen mit konzentrierter Salzslure (unter C1,-Entwicklung) schnelle Zersetzung statt. 11.

Die Ausgleichsrechnung fiihrte zu den Gitterkonstanten a = 2,80,, b = 5,75,, c = 4,58, d. Den weiteren Betrachtungen werden die aus Gurivm-Aufnahmen erhaltenen Gitterkonstanten zugrunde gelegt.

LiMnO, (Mol-Vol. : 22,25 em3) bildet sich also aus den Komponenten Li,O und Mn203 (Summe der halben Mol-Vol.: 23,20 em3) unter Kontraktion Bei gleichem Molvolumen wurde man nun fur eine im NaC1-Typ kubisch, nit statistischer Verteilung von Li+und Mn3+-kristallisierende Form von L,MnO, eine Gitterkonstante a, = 4,19, A erwarten. Nun ist ( 4,1 yo ) . ac . 1/2j2 = 2,96, A (beobachtet: a = 2,804 a, . 1/ 2 1= 5,93, A b = 5,75, d aC = 4,19, A c = 4,57, A). Diese numerischen Zusammenhange weisen deutlich darauf hin, da13 die Realstruktur von LiMnO, eine orthorhombische Variante des NaC1-Typs ist. 111.

Uber MADELun-G-Faktor und MAPLE-Werte von LiMnOz Es ist bekannt, wie schwierig Berechnungen der Gitterenergie selbst einfacher Verbindungen sind, betrachtet man Kreisprozesse, bei denen die Verbindungen aus ihren Elementen ent~tehen~~).

Das Herausriicken der 02--Teilchen aus den Ideallagen von Modell I1 erhoht MAPLE erheblich. Alle einfachen NaC1-Varianten (Modelle V a, V b) mit statistischer Verteilung von Li+ und Mn3+ liegen erheblich niedriger im MAPLE-Wert. Stabile Formen dieser Art sind bei LiMnO, wohl kaum zu erwarten. Auch die partiell geordneten NaC1-Varianten, Modell VI a, VI b, sind deutlich ungunstiger als Modell IV. Die Varianten im a-LiFe0,-Typ sind erwartungsgemal3 deutlich gunstiger als die einfachen NaC1-Modelle mit statistischer Verteilung. Am giinstigsten ist hier Modell VIId, das im MAPLE-Wert praktisch dem Modell IV entspricht. Dieser hohe MAPLE-Wert ist aber erkauft worden durch ein deutlich zu kleines Molvolumen, das seinerseits Modell VII d ausschlieBt. Bei den Modellen VIII a und VIII b wurde das gleiche Molvolumen wie bei Modell I V vorausgesetzt , aber , jdealisierte" Langen der Gitterkonstanten angenommen. Beide MAPLE-Werte liegen deutlich unter dem von Modell IV. Die tatsachlich beobachtete metrische VeFzerrung der Gitterkonstanten bei LiMnO, bringt also eine Erhohung des MAPLE-Wertes. Interessant ist, daB auch bei Modell VIII das Herausrucken der O-Teilchen aus den Ideallagen MAPLE erhoht. SchlieBlich sei betont, da13 Modell IV von allen Modellen auch bezuglich der Einzelsummen MAPLE(Li+) + MAPLE(Mn3+) bzw. MAPLE(O;-) + XAPLE 0 : ~ ) jeweils am gunstigsten ist, wenn man Modell VII d wegen seines anomal kleinen Nolvolumens ausschliel3t.

It represents a key for a better understanding of the complex structural evolutions pointed out in the materials like Li(Li,Ni,Mn,Co)O2 when they are used as positive electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries. Li2MnO3 samples were prepared either via coprecipitation or via a two step solid state reaction followed by different annealing treatments. Using X-ray and electron diffraction in combination with diffraction data simulations, we show that in function of the synthesis conditions, Li2MnO3 is obtained with various degrees of disorder, along the c monoclinic direction, in the stacking of the ordered Li1/3Mn2/3 sheets within the cfc oxygen packing. We show that this disorder decreases when the synthesis temperature increases but the synthesis of a material free of stacking faults is not possible with these synthesis routes. Finally, the similarities between the evolutions pointed out in Li2MnO3 due to the synthesis conditions and those previously observed in the materials like Li(Li,Ni,Mn,Co)O2 related to the evolution of the cations distribution in the slabs are underlined. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The main material used as positive electrode in lithium-ion batteries remains the LiCoO2 layered oxide. But, despite good electrochemical performances [1], the limited availability of cobalt makes this material expensive and limits thus its use to small cells. LiNiO2 derivatives, such as LiNi1 −x −yCoxAlyO2, were found to be a good alternative for large scale applications as they deliver high energy and power densities [2]. For transport applications, such as for hybrid and electric vehicles, safety remains the main concern for most of the materials: indeed they can be highly unstable in the very delithiated state (overcharged state of the battery) with possible loss of oxygen and heat generation through reaction of this oxygen with the liquid organic electrolyte [3]. More recently, the layered transition metal oxides Li1 + x(Ni1/2 −yMn1/2 −yCo2y)1 −xO2 have attracted much attention due to their large capacity and good cyclability, with a much higher thermal stability in the desintercalated state (increase of the decomposition temperature from 70 °C to 100 °C vs. LiNi1 −x −yCoxAlyO2) [4–9]. These systems contain of Ni2+, Ni3+, Mn4+ and Co3+ ions, the Mn4+ ions being at the origin of their largely improved chemical and thermal stability. From a structural point of view, these Mn4+-rich compounds appear complex. They can still be described as O3-type structures, but with lithium ions sitting both in the slab and in the interslab space and with the formation a cation ordering in the transition metal layers. This cation ordering in the slabs (superstructures in the (a, b) planes) is very similar to that reported for Li2MnO3, nevertheless the existence of diffusion in the X-ray and electron diffraction patterns [10] makes difficult to explain what is going on in the third dimension (along the c-axis). Li2MnO3 being viewed as a model compound for this system, because of its structural similarities, we decided to revisit its chemistry and structural properties. The chemical formula Li2MnO3 can be written as Li[Li1/3Mn2/3]O2 and can thus be described as LiMO2 layered compounds; it is an O3type structure where interslab octahedral sites are only occupied by lithium ions whereas slab octahedral sites are occupied by lithium and manganese ions in proportion (1:2). Due to the differences in ionic radii between Li+ and Mn4+ (0.74 and 0.54 Å respectively [12]), these ions are ordered in the slabs to minimize the strains. The stacking along c of these ordered cationic planes is responsible for the reduction of the symmetry from the trigonal symmetry of the O3-type structure (R-3m) to the monoclinic one of Li2MnO3 (C2/m) This structure has been determined by Strobel et al. [11] using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The unit cell parameters are amon=4.937(1) Å, bmon.= 8.532(1) Å, cmon.=5.030(2) Å and β=109.46(3)°. Lithium ions occupy the 2b (0, 1/2, 0), 2c (0, 0, 1⁄2) and 4 h (0, 0.66, 1⁄2) sites, the manganese ions, the 4 g (0, 0.167, 0) site, and the oxygen ions, the 4i (0.219, 0, 0.227) and 8j (0.254, 0.321, 0.223) sites. However, due to difficulties in modeling the experimental X-ray diffraction pattern profile and because of uncertainty in the interpretation of electron diffraction patterns, discrepancies still exist in the literature about the stacking sequence of the ordered Solid State Ionics 180 (2010) 1652–1659 ⁎ Corresponding author.

Here, we report on the influence of the synthesis on the structure of Li2MnO3, not with the aim to compare two synthesis methods but to prepare different Li2MnO3 samples showing various degrees of defects. The characterization of these defects should help to get a clearer view of the changes occurring in materials like Li(Li,Ni,Mn,Co)O2 depending on the composition. For that purpose, we will also compare the results obtained in the present study with some already published by some of us concerning the Li1 + x(Ni1/2 −yMn1/2 −yCo2y)1 −xO2 materials [9]. Note also that a detailed HRTEM and electron diffraction study of one of the Li2MnO3 sample presented here is reported elsewhere [20]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Synthesis Li2MnO3 samples were prepared by two synthesis routes: one based on a coprecipitation method, and the other on a two step solid state method, to get Li2MnO3 samples with different structural properties. The coprecipitation route consisted of dripping slowly an aqueous solution of Mn(NO3)2 (Fluka 98%) into a stirred solution of LiOH (Alfa Aesar 98%), whose volume was adjusted to ensure a stoichiometric ratio (Li/Mn=2). The as obtained precipitate was dried at 80 °C in a rotavapor, ground and then heated in air at 650 °C during 12h to ensure the decomposition of the nitrates and the formation of the lithiated layered oxides. Two samples were finally obtained after a second annealing in air, either at 650 °C or at 850 °C for 24h. The two step solid state synthesis was performed according to [21]. The first step consists in the addition of 5 g of KMnO4 (Prolabo 99%) in 400 ml of distilled water with 5 ml of ethanol. The mixture is maintained in a stainless steel autoclave at 100 °C during 24h under stirring. This step leads to the formation of a nanosized MnO(OH) powder. The prepared highly divided material was washed with distilled water and then acetone, and dried at 80 °C during about 60h. MnO(OH) was then ground with an excess of LiOH (molar ratio Li/ Mn=2.1) to ensure the stoichiometry in spite of lithium vaporisation during the annealing treatment. Finally, the powder was washed again with distilled water and then with acetone to remove the excess of lithium source that wouldn't have reacted, and then dried at 80 °C. Two samples were finally obtained after an annealing in air, either at 800 °C or at 900 °C for 4h. 2.2. Chemical, redox and thermogravimetric analyses The Li/Mn ratio was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), (Varian 720-ES) after the complete dissolution of the powder into an acidic solution. The uncertainty of the measurement is about 0.03 Li per atomic formula. The average oxidation state of manganese in the various materials was determined by iodometric back titration: the sample was dissolved at 60 °C overnight in an aqueous solution of HCl and KI, and then the resulting solution was titrated with Na2S2O3. Note that the whole process including sample dissolution was performed at least twice. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a STD Q600 Texas Instrument apparatus. Measurements were carried out from room temperature to 900 °C at a constant heating rate of 5 °C/ min, under a flow of oxygen and with about 40 mg of Li2MnO3 powder. Alumina sample holder was also used as reference sample. 2.3. X-ray diffraction characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the four samples were collected at room temperature using the Cu Kα radiation on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer in the θ–θ Bragg–Brentano geometry. The patterns were recorded in the 2θ range 10–120°, making 2θ stepscan intervals of 0.02° with a constant counting time of 45s. The patterns were analyzed by the Rietveld method as implemented in the program Fullprof [22]. Powder X-ray diffraction simulations were performed with the DIFFAX software, developed by Treacy and Newsam [23], in order to quantify the amount of stacking faults in these materials. 2.4. Electron diffraction investigation Electron diffraction patterns were collected with a JEOL 2000FX microscope equipped with a double tilt specimen holder. It was used at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The grids observed were prepared by dropping them in a suspension of ground material dispersed in ethanol. Selected Area Electron Diffraction patterns were simulated along the [110] monoclinic zone axis using the DIFFAX software in order to illustrate the influence in the electron diffraction pattern of faults in the slabs stacking. Our presentstudy highlights theprevious observation we made on the Li1 +x(Ni1/2−yMn1/2−yCo2y)1 −xO2 materials. All information about the synthesis and the characterisation of these materials can be found in reference [9]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Thermogravimetric analyses As shown in Fig. 1, a TGA analysis of a LiOH and γ-MnOOH mixture (such as Li/Mn atomic ratio=2.3) was performed in order to follow the formation of Li2MnO3. Desorption of adsorbed water on γ-MnOOH is at the origin of the first weight loss (~7%wt.) observed until ~80 °C, the first step of this thermal analysis reveals thus that the true nominal LiOH/γ-MnOOH molar ratio is closer to 2.49 than to 2.3. The loss of mass occurring above 80 °C (~14%wt.) is in good agreement with the formation of Li2MnO3 from a mixture of LiOH and γ-MnOOH. The plateau observed above 550 °C shows that Li2MnO3 is stable until ~800 °C. The further loss of weight above 800 °C is associated at least to oxygen loss as it will be described in detail elsewhere [24]. This thermogravimetric analysis reveals thus that Li2MnO3 can be obtained from a mixture of LiOH and γ-MnOOH heated above 550 °C. The four samples synthesised here are for two of them in the thermal stability domain of Li2MnO3, whereas the two others are at its frontier. 3.2. XRD patterns refinement and their simulations The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Li2MnO3 samples are given in Fig. 2. All the reflections can be indexed in the monoclinic system Fig. 1. Thermogravimetric analysis performed for a mixture of LiOH and γ-MnOOH in the molar ratio 2.3:1, at a constant heating rate of 5 °C/min, under a flow of oxygen. 1653 A. Boulineau et al. / Solid State Ionics 180 (2010) 1652–1659 using the space group C2/m. When the synthesis is performed at high temperature (900 °C) all the peaks are really sharp, indicating the formation of a well crystallized material. A broadening is observed when the synthesis temperature decreases, especially huge for the reflections related to the Li/Mn ordering in the slabs, i.e. reflections (020), (110), (-111), (021) and (111) in the 20–34° 2θCu range. Note that for the coprecipitated powder annealed at 650 °C the broadening is so huge that the reflections (020), (110), (−111) and (021) are convoluted in a unique asymmetric diffuse peak. The four samples present average manganese oxidation state and Li/Mn ratio close to 4 and 2 respectively, leading for the first three samples to a global chemical formula very close to that expected, see Table 1. In good agreement with the TGA results discussed just before, the sample obtained through the solid state reaction at 900 °C was found to be obviously deficient in oxygen. This discrepancy with the ideal stoichiometry has been studied in detail and was shown to be due to the presence of spinel-type defects at the surface of the particles [24]. Note nevertheless that the small deviation from the ideal stoichiometry expected for samples annealed at 800 °C and 850 °C from the TGA experiments has not been detected by chemical analyses (probably because it is within the limit of the technique). These four XRD patterns were refined according to the procedure detailed hereafter for the compound obtained through the solid state synthesis route and annealed at 900 °C. We chose to begin the XRD refinement by this material since it presents the better defined reflections. In the X-ray refinement of this material, we considered the bulk stoichiometry to be Li2MnO3 and we neglected the spinel-type defect responsible for the deviation of the global stoichiometry from the ideal one. Due to the presence of diffusion especially in the 20–26° (2θ) range, the background was modeled with great care using an interpolated background, then the structural and profile parameters (according to a pseudo-Voigt profile function for these latter) were refined using the following order: (i) scale factor and sample displacement correction, (ii) cell parameters, (iii) profile parameters, (iv) atomic positions, (v) sites occupancies and (vi) isotropic atomic thermal displacement parameters (Biso). 19 parameters were finally refined (on the basis of 171 reflections). The first refinement was carried out considering the ideal cation distribution, so in accordance with the formula {(Li2)2c(Li4)4 h}interslab{(Li2)2b(Mn4)4 g}slab(O12)4i,8j. Refined lithium thermal displacement parameters on the 2c, 4 h and 2b sites were found equal to 2.2(9) Å2, −3.7(5) Å2 and −5.2(2) Å2 respectively, that of manganese on the 4 g site was found equal to 0.55(5) Å2 and those of oxygen on the 4i and 8j sites were found equal to 0.2(2) Å2 and 0.2(1) Å2 respectively ; the as obtained conventional Rietveld R-factors for points with Bragg contribution were Rwp=29.7% and RBragg=11.5% with Scor=3.02. The large negative values obtained for the thermal displacement parameters on the 4 h and 2b lithium sites suggested an electronic density excess that led us to consider a possible Li/Mn exchange between the 4 h and 4 g sites on one side and between the 2b and 4 g sites on the other side in accordance with the formula {(Li2)2c (Li4 −yMny)4 h}interslab{(Li2 −zMnz)2b(Mn4 −y −zLiy + z)4 g}slab(O12)4i,8j. The 4 cation crystallographic sites were still considered to be fully occupied. As the simultaneous refinement of the site occupancies and the thermal displacement parameters led to the divergence of the latter, the lithium sites Biso were thus fixed to 1.0 Å2, the manganese site Biso to 0.5 Å2 and the oxygen site Biso to 0.8 Å2, in good agreement with those already reported for other LiMO2 materials [25]. The comparison of the experimental and calculated X-ray diffraction patterns for this sample is presented in Fig. 3, and the structural and profile parameters obtained are reported in Table 2. In spite of a rather good minimization of the difference between the observed and the calculated intensities, the fit to the profile and the reliability factors remain rather poor. This is due to differential line broadenings of the reflexions, and especially to the broadening of the bottom of the (020) and (110) peaks as shown in insert in Fig. 3. The as refined unit cell parameters are close to those reported by Strobel et al. on single crystal [11]. The exchange ratio between the Mn ions from the slab (4 g site) and the Li ions from the interslab space (4 h site) is very small, only 0.06 ions are exchanged, whereas around 0.29 ions are exchanged between the Mn 4 g and Li 2b sites in the slabs leading to the crystallographic formula {(Li2)2c (Li3.94Mn0.06)4h}interslab{(Li1.71Mn0.29)2b(Mn3.65Li0.35)4g}slab(O12)4i,8j. Table 3 sums up the cell and structural parameters obtained for the fours powders via the Rietveld refinement of their XRD data. The sites occupancies present some significant changes depending on the synthesis conditions. The lower the temperature of the annealing treatment the higher is the percentage of manganese ions in the Fig. 2.

An increase in the annealing temperature tends thus to lead to a material closer and closer to the ideal one, i.e. with a cation distribution in agreement with {(Li2)2c (Li4)4h}interslab{(Li2)2b(Mn4)4g}slab(O12)4i,8j. Note nevertheless that whatever the synthesis conditions chosen in this study the Li/Mn exchange in the slabs remain significant (~15 at.%). In a perfect Li2MnO3 compound, all the ordered (Li1/3Mn2/3) cationic planes are stacked along the cmon. axis according to a unique stacking vector which is the → Cmon translation. Note that the refinements described just before were performed according to such an hypothesis. Nevertheless as proposed at first by Lang [13], and more recently by Bréger et al. [14], two other stacking vectors exist and would lead to stacking very close in energy (1 or 2 meV of difference); their statistical occurrence would generate so called “stacking faults”. To quantify the effect of such stacking faults on the X-ray diffraction pattern of Li2MnO3, we performed simulations by the means of the DIFFAX software. Such simulations require to define primary blocks which are then stacked. To describe Li2MnO3 a unique type of blocks constituted by a slab and an interslab space has been considered, each block being stacked over the previous one according to one of the three possible stacking vectors, whose coordinates are (0; 0; 1) (1/2; −1/6; 1) and (1/6; −1/6; 1) in the monoclinic system. Note that all the simulations were done in the hypothesis of an LiO2 interslab between each (Li1/3Mn2/3)O2 slab. The exclusive occurrence of one of this vector leads to the perfect stacking but their alternations create stacking faults. Probabilities are affected to the three vectors so that the quantity of stacking faults occurring statistically is well known and imposed. As shown in Fig. 4, probabilities of faults have been varied continuously from 0 to 100%. Note that the increasing amount of stacking faults induces a continuous broadening of the (020), (110), (−111), (021) and (111) diffraction lines in the 20–34° 2θCu range, in good agreement with the decreasing coherent domain size of the ordered domains. Furthermore, by comparing the intensities ratio of the experimental (110) and (020) peaks (I(110)/I(020)) with the calculated ones, we could roughly estimate the percentage of stacking faults in each Li2MnO3 sample we prepared. Calculated X-ray diffraction patterns with a given amount of stacking faults and corresponding rather well to the experimental patterns are given for an easier comparison in Fig. 5. According to those simulations, a higher annealing temperature implies a decrease in the amount of stacking faults. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 6a for Li2MnO3 obtained by solid state reaction at 800 °C, the experimental (020), (110), (−111), (021) and (111) diffraction lines remain sharper than expected considering 20% of statistically distributed stacking faults: this reveals that the coherence domain length of the ideally ordered domains remains larger than expected and thus that there is a concentration of stacking faults in given zones of the crystals (i.e. a deviation from the statistic).

Boulineau et al. / Solid State Ionics 180 (2010) 1652–1659 In Fig. 6b is given the comparison of the experimental XRD pattern with that calculated for a mixture of crystallites showing either the ideal stacking (80%) or the 100% faulted stacking (20%): this would correspond to the limit case with a maximum concentration of faults. Note that in that latter case, sharp (020), (110), (−111), (021) and (111) diffraction lines are expected, in addition to the asymmetric diffuse peak. As suggested by the experimental profile of the reflections (see insert of Figs. 3 and 6), the actual situation in the samples is probably between these two limit cases. Or in other words, the stacking faults are not statistically distributed in the material but are gathered in some parts of the crystals. It is relevant that the amount of stacking faults evolves in accordance with the amount of exchange between lithium and manganese into the slabs; when the amount of faults decreases, the exchange decreases and reciprocally. This result shows that the Li/Mn exchange in the slabs quantified by the Rietveld refinement is in fact not related to a partial disorder in each slab between the two sites, but to a disorder occurring along the c monoclinic direction due to faults in the stacking of the ordered slabs. A localized stacking fault that leads to a shift in the (a, b) plane of a cationic ordered (Li1/3Mn2/3) plane induces changes in the occupancies of the manganese ions on the 2b site and of the lithium ions on the 4 g site because the structure is described, via the refinement, through an ‘average’ structural model in which all the cationic ordered (Li1/3Mn2/3) planes stack always according to the same stacking vector. Such stacking faults lead thus to an apparent statistical exchange between Mn and Li. Note that these stacking faults are not expected to be at the origin of a Li/Mn exchange between the interslab and the slab. The peak shape presents some significant changes depending on the reflection as the amount of stacking faults increases, reflections (020) and (110) show for instance a huge broadening with an inversion of their intensities. The experimental profile can thus not be fitted correctly by a pseudo-Voigt profile function, inducing major discrepancies between the experimental and the calculated peak profiles that can be – from a calculation point of view – balance by changes in the sites occupancies and especially in the distribution of the electrons densities (or cations) between slabs and interslabs. According to this, presence of manganese ions in the interslab space – that remains low – is in our opinion just an artifact.

Boulineau et al. / Solid State Ionics 180 (2010) 1652–1659 3.3. Electron diffraction study Electron diffraction patterns collected along the [110] monoclinic zone axis are presented in Fig. 7 for our two extreme samples: the one synthesised by the coprecipitation route and annealed at 650 °C for 24h and the second obtained by the solid state reaction and annealed at 900 °C for 4h. Both patterns highlight the existence of diffuse scattering lines parallel to the c* monoclinic axis. They are broad and no spots are distinguishable for the former material, whereas they are thinner and spots localized on the diffuse lines are clearly seen on the pattern related to the latter one. The location of the diffuse scattering lines confirms the existence of a superstructure and thus that lithium and manganese cations are ordered in the slabs whatever the synthesis route and the annealing treatment we performed. As stacking faults of the ordered cationic (Li1/3Mn2/3) planes occur along the c-axis, diffusion lines in the electron diffraction patterns can be their signatures. In the same way as for X-ray diffraction, we simulated the electron diffraction patterns along the [110] zone axis for various amounts of faults, see Fig. 8. It is relevant that spots affected by the diffusion become more and more extended to finish by composing an unbroken line when the disorder in the staking sequence along the c monoclinic axis is maximal. On the pattern Fig. 6.

Comparison of electron diffraction patterns obtained along the [110] monoclinic zone axis: a) for the coprecipitated sample annealed at 650 °C for 24 h and b) for the solid state synthesised one annealed at 900 °C for 4 h. 1657 A. Boulineau et al. / Solid State Ionics 180 (2010) 1652–1659 related to the sample synthesised by the solid state reaction, the localization of distinguishable spots on the diffuse scattering lines traduces the fact that ordered Li/Mn slabs are stacked preferentially according to the stacking vector (0; 0; 1) in monoclinic description, but the diffusion between the spots that still exist, traduces the existence of some disorder in this stacking. On the basis of our description of the structural feature of Li2MnO3 (i.e. (Li)interslab(Li1/3Mn2/3)slabO2) the crystallographic properties of Li1 + x(Ni0.425Mn0.425Co0.15)1 −xO2 with x=0 and x=0.12 that have been previously studied in our lab can be clarified. These materials adopt the α-NaFeO2-type structure, described in the space group R-3m, with a cation distribution between the slab and the interslab space such as (Li1 −zNiII z)Interslab(Liz +xNi0.425(1 −x) −zMn0.425(1 −x)Co0.15(1−x))Slab. As compared in Fig. 9 some of us already pointed out the existence of extra diffuse scattering lines parallel to the c* direction in the reciprocal space of such materials. The position of these diffuse lines dividing by 3 the distance between two lines of spots perfectly indexed in the R-3m spacegroup reveals a two dimensional superstructure (√3.ahex×√3ahex) in the (a ; b) planes [10]. Contrary to Li2MnO3, the compositions of the studied materials do not allow a perfect cation distribution between the two crystallographic sites in the slabs [10,26]. Indeed, for Li1.12 (Ni0.425Mn0.425Co0.15)0.88O2 (x=0.12) it was shown that the slab composition was Li+ 0.14Ni2+ 0.114Ni3+ 0.24Mn4+ 0.374Co3+ 0.132 [9,27] with the “big cations” (Li+, Ni2+) occupying the larger cation site in the slab and the “small cations” (Ni3+, Mn4+, Co3+) occupying mainly the smaller one. In fact the (Li+, Ni2+)/(Ni3+, Mn4+, Co3+) ratio is 0.74 whereas the “big cations”/“small cations” ratio implying the perfect order is 0.5. For LiNi0.425Mn0.425Co0.15O2 (x=0) this ratio becomes 0.37. For x=0, the presence of unbroken diffuse scattering lines indicates the lack of correlation between the transition cations planes whereas, for x=0.12 the diffuse scattering lines are still observed but the intensity along these lines is not uniform anymore: a higher intensity is observed at the positions where the C2/m reflexions of Li2MnO3 are located which means that the stacking of the ordered plane tends to be that observed in this former compound. This trend can be related to the evolution of the cation distribution in the materials. Indeed, the difference between the x=0 and the x=0.12 material is the ratio “big cations”/“small cations” which is more or less close to 0.5 (0.74 vs. 0.37) implying a less long Fig. 8.

Conclusion We have studied various Li2MnO3 samples obtained via two synthesis routes and different annealing treatments. X-ray and electron diffraction revealed that it was not possible to synthesize the ideal compound, i.e. free of stacking faults, via these syntheses. Indeed, we demonstrate that the ordered (Li1/3Mn2/3) cationic planes are never perfectly stacked along the c-axis as it should be when the structure of this compound is described using the C2/m space group. The frequency of the stacking faults depends on the temperature of the thermal treatment used during the synthesis: the higher the temperature is the lower the frequency. A similar evolution, in function of the stoichiometry, has been pointed out for the Li1 +x(Ni0.425Mn0.425Co0.15)1 −xO2 compounds. Depending of the composition, and then of the more or less adequacy of the stoichiometry to the order in the cationic layer, the stacking along c of the ordered cationic planes presents a variable number of defects.

The structure, magnetic properties, and valence state of Mn were determined before and after the storage using Mn K-edge XANES, X-ray diffraction, SQUID, ICP spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. After the storage at 80 jC for 6 days, single-phase property was observed at x = 0 and 0.96 in Li1.02  xMn1.98O4, while multi-phase property was observed between the compositions, x = 0.18 and 0.63. Shallow de-lithiated region near x = 0.18 was easily affected by the storage; the Li/Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 cell showed large capacity failure from 111 to 40 mAh/g after the storage, which corresponded to the phase transition with the increase in the valence state of Mn after the storage. Magnetic measurement was found to be quite sensitive and effective to detect the subtle structural changes caused by the high-temperature storage. D 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction Lithium manganese spinel is one of the most promising cathode materials for lithium secondary battery [1]. The cycling performance using the spinel cathode has been extremely improved for the cells operated at room temperature [2], while the capacity failure after the storage at elevated temperature is one of the major problems to be solved. The dissolution of manganese ions from the spinel cathode was undoubtedly considered as a trigger of the damage to the battery systems using LiPF6 electrolyte. In addition, several mechanisms followed by the dissolution have been proposed [3–14]: (a) theoretical capacity change 0167-2738/03/$ see front matter D 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The compositions, structure, and Mn valence state of the spinel are affected by the Mn dissolution under the high-temperature storage. However, those changes have not been clearly understood, partly because its structural changes are very small, and because the decrease in crystallinity makes it difficult to determine the changes by diffraction technique. We tried to use magnetic properties as a probe to detect the subtle structural changes. Magnetic properties of the spinels have been investigated previously. For example, Tabuchi et al. [15] reported the changes in the effective magnetic moment and the Weiss temperature with increasing Mn oxidation state in the defect Li1  dMn2  dO4 spinel. Masquelier et al. [16] reported that the oxidation of Mn3 + to Mn4 + state resulted in a progressive change from the antiferromagnetic (LiMn2O4, h =  266 K) to ferromagnetic (Li4Mn5O12, h= + 40 K) behavior in the LiMn2O4–Li4Mn5O12 system. Shimakawa et al. [17] also reported the change from the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic behavior with increasing Mn4 +/Mn3 + ratio in Li1 + xMn2  xO4. Furthermore, Endres et al. [18] reported the appearance of antiferromagnetic transition at 40 K with increasing oxygen vacancy in LiMn2O4  y. These magnetic measurements give us information on the valence state of Mn as well as the structures of lithium manganese spinels. In this study, the stability of de-lithiated samples Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 using H2SO4 [19] was examined in the electrolyte at elevated temperature, and the changes in magnetic behavior were clarified. The magnetic measurement was used as a main tool to obtain information on the valence states of Mn and structural changes. Furthermore, the relationships between the storage conditions, structural changes, and their electrochemical properties were discussed based on the magnetic data. 2.

The raw materials were weighed, mixed, pelletized, and pre-fired in air at 673 K for 48 h and were then fired in air at 973 K for 48 h. Lithium-deficient spinels were synthesized chemically by the treatment of 7.333 g of Li1.02Mn1.98O4 in 200 ml H2SO4 (0.072–0.576 N) for 9 h. High-temperature storage experiments were examined in 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DEC (1:1) electrolyte solution (Tomiyama Petrochemical, battery grade). About 3.5 g of samples was kept in 8.6 g of electrolyte at 80 jC for 6 days. The samples were washed by DEC and dried under vacuum at room temperature. The Li/Mn ratios were determined by ICP spectroscopy. The Mn K-edge XANES spectra were measured by transmission mode with a laboratory type X-ray spectrometer, EXAC-820 (Technos) at 293 K. The X-ray generator with a Mn rotating anode and LaB6 cathode was operated with a voltage of 20 kV and a current of 200 mA. The incident X-ray beam was monochromatized with a Ge(400) Johansson curved crystal for XANES measurement. The intensity of the X-ray beam was measured by a sealed proportional counter filled with 25% Ar and 75% N2 gases for the incident X-ray and by a solid-state detector for the transmitted X-ray. The monochromator angle was calibrated with a characteristic Mn X-ray line for each measurement. XANES spectra were normalized at 6.65 keV. The Mn K-edge energy was defined as the energy at the half height of the Mn K-edge absorption edge. Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction patterns for Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 treated in H2SO4 for 9 h. Fig. 2.

Kobayashi et al. / Solid State Ionics 156 (2003) 309–318 311 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powdered samples were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Rotaflex/Rint-TTR) with CuKa radiation. The diffraction data were collected for 2 s at each 0.02j step width over a 2h range from 15j to 120j. The structural parameters were refined by Rietveld analysis using the computer program RIETAN97-beta [20]. The initial structural parameters were used from the refinement results of neutron diffraction data [21,22]. Temperature dependence and magnetic field dependence of the magnetization were measured by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS2) between 5 and 300 K. The sign and magnitude of the applied magnetic field were determined with a granular Pb metal. The magnetization was measured after cooling in zero field, and then measured again down to 5 K in applied magnetic field. Electrochemical intercalation and deintercalation were carried out using lithium cells with a coin-type configuration. The working electrode consisted of a mixture of 20-mg samples, 6.7-mg acetylene black, and 3.3-mg Teflon powder. The mixture was pressed into a tablet of 15-mm diameter under a pressure of 0.5 MPa. The counter electrode was a 16-mm-diameter and 0.2-mm-thickness disk of lithium metal. A microporous polypropylene sheet was employed as the separator. The electrolyte used in these cells was 1 M LiClO4 in PC:DEC (1:1) electrolyte solution (Tomiyama Petrochemical, battery grade). The cells were constructed in an argon-filled glove box. The electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature after standing overnight under zero Table 2 K-edge and peak top energy in XANES spectra for the samples delithiated by chemical treatment (a), and the samples after stored in the electrolytes at high-temperatures (b) (a) Samples Ab (eV) Bb (eV) Cb (eV) Db (eV) Eb (eV) Fb (eV) K-edge energy 6548.32 6548.43 6549.00 6549.08 6549.25 6550.38 Peak top energy 6556.0 6556.0 6556.5 6556.5 6556.5 6557.5 (b) Samples Aa (eV) Ba (eV) Ca (eV) Da (eV) Ea (eV) Fa (eV) K-edge energy 6548.07 6548.43 6548.08 6548.51 6548.18 6549.67 Peak top energy 6556.0 6557.0 6557.0 6557.0 6557.0 6557.5 Fig. 3.

Cell properties were measured galvanostatically using BT2004 (Nagano). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Synthesis and characterization of the spinel delithiated chemically Table 1 summarizes the ICP and X-ray Rietveld results for the lithium-deficient spinels treated in H2SO4 using Li1.02Mn1.98O4. The symbols, ‘‘Ab’’ and ‘‘Bb’’ to ‘‘Fb’’ represent the host and de-lithiated spinels, respectively. The lithium content of the delithiated samples was controlled by the concentration of H2SO4 from 0.072 to 0.576 N. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns for the host and the de-lithiated samples. Single-phase property was obtained by H2SO4 treatment with the concentrations, 0.072– 0.216 and 0.576 N, while multi-phase property was obtained by the treatment of 0.288 N. ICP results showed the decrease of Li/Mn ratios from 0.42 to 0.04 with increasing H2SO4 concentration from 0.072 to 0.576 N. The lattice parameters of these spinels were refined by the Rietveld analysis. Fig. 2 shows the composition dependence of lattice parameters for the samples de-lithiated chemically, together with the data obtained for the samples de-lithiated electrochemically in the present study. The lattice parameters decreased from ‘‘Bb’’ to ‘‘Fb’’ with the increase of the H2SO4 content, through the twophase region of ‘‘Eb’’. These parameters and the lithium contents were well consistent with our results of the de-lithiated samples obtained by the charge of lithium cell. Table 2 summarizes the Mn K-edge energies for Li1.02  xMn1.98O4. The continuous shift of Mn Kedge absorption energy to higher energy from ‘‘Ab’’ to ‘‘Fb’’ indicated that the average valence state of Mn increased with decreasing Li content from x = 0 to 0.94, through the two-phase region of ‘‘Eb’’. 3.2. XRD and XANES results High-temperature storage in the electrolytes was examined using the samples de-lithiated chemically. The samples ‘‘Ab’’ to ‘‘Fb’’ were kept in the electrolyte at 80 jC for 6 days. The samples after the storage were represented as ‘‘Aa’’ to ‘‘Fa’’, where ‘‘a’’ indicates the samples after the storage. The notation from ‘‘A’’ to ‘‘F’’ corresponds to the concentration of H2SO4 used for the de-lithiation. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns for the samples after the storage. The XRD peaks became broad with the storage except the sample ‘‘Fa’’. Single-phase property was observed for the samples with the initial composition ‘‘Aa’’, and with the deep charged state ‘‘Fa’’, while multi-phase property was observed for the samples with shallow and middle charged state, ‘‘Ba’’ to ‘‘Ea’’. The samples Fig. 4. X-ray diffraction patterns for Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 before and after the storage in electrolyte solution at 80 jC. H. Kobayashi et al. / Solid State Ionics 156 (2003) 309–318 313 ‘‘Ba’’ to ‘‘Ea’’ are composed of two (or three) phases with larger and smaller lattice parameters, which was indicated by the change in peak position shown in Fig. 4. The sample ‘‘Ba’’ showed the large shift of the peak position to higher angles, indicating the existence of Mn4 +-rich spinel as a main phase. The ICP results showed the increase of Li/Mn ratio after the storage, indicating the dissolution of Mn from the spinel structure. Fig. 5 shows the Mn K-edge XANES spectra for Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 before and after the storage. After the storage, the peak edge shift to lower energy was observed except the sample ‘‘Ba’’, indicating the increase in Mn3 + component, while the peak top shift to higher energy was observed for samples ‘‘Aa’’ to ‘‘Da’’, indicating the increase in Mn4 + component. These numerical data are shown in Table 2. These changes in Mn K-edge absorption energy reflected the composition shift from single-phase Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 to two (three) phases with Mn3 + and Mn4 +-rich composition after the storage. Especially, the appearance of Mn4 +-rich spinel was clarified by the profile change from sample ‘‘Bb’’ to ‘‘Ba’’. The lattice parameter of the sample ‘‘Ab’’ decreased with the storage from 8.238 to 8.231 A ̊ for ‘‘Aa’’, while the lattice parameter of the sample ‘‘Fb’’ increased from 8.042 to 8.043 A ̊ for ‘‘Fa’’. These results are consistent with the XANES results that the increase in the Mn4 + component was observed for the sample ‘‘Aa’’, while the increase in the Mn3 + component was found for the sample ‘‘Fa’’.

Magnetic properties Magnetic susceptibility was measured for the samples ‘‘Ab’’, ‘‘Bb’’, ‘‘Fb’’, ‘‘Aa’’, ‘‘Ba’’, and ‘‘Fa’’. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility, v, in the range of 5–300 K. The spinglass-like behavior with a cusp around 10 K was observed for the sample ‘‘Ab’’, and the abrupt increase in the magnetic susceptibility was observed below 40 K for the sample ‘‘Bb’’. The sample ‘‘Fb’’ showed the cusp around 30 K. The shift of the cusp to higher temperatures was observed with the decrease in lithium content from the samples ‘‘Ab’’ to ‘‘Fb’’. After the storage, the susceptibility increased and the cusp became sharp for the samples ‘‘A’’ to ‘‘E’’, while the cusp around 30 K disappeared for the sample ‘‘Fa’’. The increase in the ferromagnetic component that originated from the Mn4 +–O–Mn4 + interaction was indicated by the increase in the susceptibility for all the samples. All the samples show the temperature-dependent susceptibilities with no magnetic ordering down to 180 K. The effective magnetic moment (leff) was calculated using the equation vm  1=(T  h)/Cm (Cm: Curie constant, h: Weiss temperature) from the data in the temperature region of 180–300 K. Table 3 summarizes the magnetic parameters of leff and h. The theoretical effective moment of 4.37 and 3.87 lB was expected for Li1.02Mn1.98O4 and Li0.08Mn1.98O4, respectively, from mixed valence state consisting of Mn3 + (S = 2, 4.90 lB) in the high-spin state and Mn4 + (S = 3/2, 3.87 lB), assuming spin-only contribution for the magnetic moment. These values were in good agreement with the values of 4.37 and 3.77 lB determined for the samples ‘‘Ab’’ and ‘‘Fb’’, respectively. For the sample ‘‘Bb’’, the leff value increased and the h value decreased with the deintercalation of lithium from Li1.02Mn1.98O4. After the storage, both the leff and h values decreased for all the samples. The decrease in the leff value indicates that the valence state of Mn ions increased after the storage. Fig. 7 shows the applied field (H) dependence of magnetization (M) before and after the storage. In these series, the magnetization increases after the storage. Particularly, a large difference in the H–M curve was observed between the samples ‘‘Bb’’ and ‘‘Ba’’. The increase in the ferromagnetic component that originated from the Mn4 +–O–Mn4 + interaction was indicated by the increase in the hysteresis for the sample ‘‘Ba’’. These results indicated that the sample ‘‘Bb’’ was easily affected by the storage and changed to a spinel with a Mn4 +-rich composition. Fig. 6.

Electrochemical properties Table 4 summarizes the discharge capacity and the capacity ratios, (the capacity after the storage)/ (the capacity before the storage), for the samples ‘‘Ab’’, ‘‘Bb’’, ‘‘Fb’’, and ‘‘Aa’’, ‘‘Ba’’, ‘‘Fa’’. The Li/Li1.02Mn1.98O4 (sample ‘‘Ab’’) cell showed the capacity of 129 mAh/g, while capacity failure from 129 to 101 mAh/g was observed for the sample ‘‘Aa’’ after the storage at 80 jC. The large capacity failure from 111 to 40 mAh/g and from 121 to 79 mAh/g was observed for the sample ‘‘Ba’’ and ‘‘Fa’’, respectively. The large capacity failure of the sample ‘‘Ba’’ corresponds to the significant changes in the composition and properties observed by our XRD, XANES, and magnetic measurements. 3.5. Discussion The de-intercalated phase, Li0.84Mn1.98O4 (sample ‘‘Bb’’), changed significantly in the electrolyte solution containing LiPF6 at 80 jC, and this indicated that the phase is the most unstable among the de-intercalated phases. The composition of the phase Li0.84 Mn1.98O4 was represented as [Li0.8250.18][Li0.02 Mn1.98]O4 (5: cation vacancy), which corresponds to the shallow charge state in the cathode materials. The composition of the sample ‘‘Ba’’ was determined from the ICP results to be Li0.84Mn1.90O4, assuming that only Mn ions dissolved into the electrolyte solution at 80 jC. The observed capacity of 40 mAh/g was much smaller than the capacity of 104 mAh/g calculated from Li0.84Mn1.90O4. After the storage, the sample ‘‘Bb’’ changed to the sample ‘‘Ba’’, which is composed of the main phase ‘‘Ba–S’’ with a smaller lattice parameter of 8.12 A ̊ and a small amount of second-phase ‘‘Ba–L’’ with a larger lattice parameter of 8.21 A ̊ . Comparing the characteristics of this main phase with the host ‘‘Ab’’ and de-lithiated samples ‘‘Bb’’ to ‘‘Db’’, the structure and properties are similar to those of the sample ‘‘Db’’ with a lattice parameter of 8.16 A ̊ refined by XRD measurement, the manganese valence observed by the XANES experiments, and the magnetic behavior by magnetic measurement. In addition, the valence state of Mn ion with + 3.77 for the sample ‘‘Ba–S’’ is close to that of Mn ion with + 3.76 for the de-lithiated sample Li0.55Mn1.98O4, although the influence of a small amount of the phase ‘‘Ba–L’’ on the structure and physical properties is taken into account. In Fig. 2, the phase with a lattice parameter of about 8.12 A ̊ is strongly observed after the storage at 80 jC. These results indicate that the phase near the composition of Li0.55Mn1.98O4 is more stable than the samples in the shallow charged state, and the Mn dissolution caused Fig. 7.

Kobayashi et al. / Solid State Ionics 156 (2003) 309–318 316 the phase transition to a Mn4 +-rich phase with a disorder of Li ion conduction pathway. Li0.08Mn1.98O4 (sample ‘‘Fb’’) is represented as [Li0.0650.94][Li0.02Mn1.98]O4 (5: cation vacancy), which corresponds to the fully charged state. Since the Mn valence state is 4+, there are two explanations of Mn dissolution: Li ions intercalate to structure during the storage, or Mn ions dissolved to electrolyte solution as MnO or Mn3O4. Assuming that the valence state of Mn ions was 4+ after the storage, the composition of the sample ‘‘Fa’’ was calculated to be Li0.29Mn1.93O4. The observed capacity of 79 mAh/g was smaller than the capacity of 116 mAh/g calculated from Li0.29Mn1.93O4. The ferromagnetic property of sample ‘‘Fa’’ indicates the appearance of a small amount of Li4Mn5O12-related phase because Li4Mn5O12 showed ferromagnetic property and much stronger susceptibility than E-MnO2. If we consider the existence of oxygen vacancy, the situation is more complex. To clarify the stability of the de-lithiated samples, two samples were kept in vacuum oven. The sample ‘‘Bb’’ kept at 60 jC for 22 h showed peak broadening of X-ray diffraction patterns with the peak shift to lower angles, while the sample ‘‘Fb’’ did not show peak shift to lower angles until the storage temperature went up to 140 jC for 3 h. Our samples obtained chemically by H2SO4 may be less stable than that obtained electrochemically. However, the decomposition of the sample ‘‘Bb’’ was observed even in air without the electrolyte solution containing LiPF6. These results indicated that the sample ‘‘Bb’’, which corresponds to the shallow charge state, is substantially unstable and the decomposition is accelerated by Mn dissolution from the spinel structure. These results are in good agreement with what has been recently reported by Li et al. [23]. The detail structural analysis is currently underway using powder neutron diffraction measurements. 4. Conclusion Li1.02  xMn1.98O4 was stored in 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DEC (1:1) electrolyte solution at 80 jC for 6 days. For Li0.84Mn1.98O4 (sample ‘‘Bb’’) with shallow charged state, multi-phase was observed in the XRD pattern and the shift of peak top to higher energy was observed in Mn K-edge XANES spectra after the storage. The increase in the ferromagnetic component was observed simultaneously. These results indicated that the increase in the Mn4 + component corresponded to the large capacity failure after the storage in the Li/Li0.84Mn1.98O4 cell. The magnetic and XANES data indicated the valence state change and coordination situation of Mn ions. It was clarified that the de-intercalated phase, Li0.84Mn1.98O4 (sample ‘‘Bb’’), is the most unstable among the de-intercalated phases in the electrolyte solution containing LiPF6 at 80 jC.

E-mail: vimas@chifis.unipv.it (Received 5 August 1996; accepted 4 October 1996) Abstract The results of the structural determination of Li2MnO3 from X-ray powder diffraction data and the refinement by the Rietveld technique are presented. The Li2MnO3 structure has a monoclinic cell with space group C2/m(Z=4) and cell parameters a=4.9246(1), b=8.5216 (1), c--5.0245 (1) A, r= 109.398 (1)°; the refinement with 14 structural parameters for 165 reflections in the pattern leads to Rwp -17.61% ,R_= 13.25% ,RB=7.07% and S=3.52. Such a so~'ution agrees with a single-crystal structure determination previously reported in the literature and allows other hypotheses to be rejected. plane parallel to the ac plane was underlined that the other authors did not consider. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that conventional laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data may very well be used for structure determination of compounds of low symmetry, like Li2MnO3. For such a compound, a detailed comparison with the pertinent single-crystal data is possible. The programs actually available for the treatment of powder data are sufficiently reliable, and represent a valid choice when single-crystal data cannot be obtained. Many different programs were used in each step for the ab initio structure determination, both to test the solution found and to compare different computing methods. I. Introduction In recent years, the system Li-Mn-O was largely investigated since some compounds such as LiMn204 and its derivatives obtained with Li-intercalation/ deintercalation are used in the electrochemical field. In a study of the spinel LiMn204 and its Li-rich phases Lil+yMn2_yO4 (Massarotti, Bini & Capsoni, 1996; Massarotti, Capsoni, Bini, Azzoni & Paleari, 1997) it was shown that, for lithium cationic fraction x > 0.36, the Li2MnO3 phase coexists with the spinel phases. To evaluate the spinel stoichiometry and phase abundance using the Riet-veld refinement, a correct structural model of the coexisting compounds is required. In the literature, several interpretations of the structure of Li2MnO3 are reported: cubic and hexagonal systems were proposed (Meyer & Hoppe, 1976) and more recent studies agree upon the monoclinic system but not upon the space group. A first work on X-ray powder diffraction data assigned the space group C2/c to Li/MnO3, according to the structure model of the isotype compound LizSnO3 (Jansen & Hoppe, 1973). Recently, single-crystal diffraction studies proposed both space group C2/c (Riou, Lecerf, Gerault & Cudennec, 1992) and C2/m (Strobel & LambertAndron, 1988): in this last case the presence of a mirror © 1997 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain all rights reserved 2. Experimental 2.1. Products The Li2MnO3 compound was synthesized from the reacting mixture MnO/LizCO3 with lithium cationic fraction x = 0.667. This mixture was heated in air up to 1173 K and, after an isothermal step of 20 h, it was cooled to room temperature (heating and cooling rate 5 K minl). 2.2. Apparatus and procedure Diffraction data were obtained on a Philips PW 1710 powder diffractometer equipped with a Philips PW 1050 vertical goniometer with a radius of 173 mm.** The Cu Ks radiation (K~ 1 = 1.5406, K~ 2 = 1.5443 A) was selected by means of a graphite monochromator. A system of diverging, receiving and anti-scattering slits of 1, 0.2 and 1 °, respectively, was used; two Soller slits were positioned both on the incident beam, before the divergent slit, and on the diffracted beam before the monochromator. * The numbered intensity of each measured point on the profiles has been deposited with the IUCr (Reference: VI0070).

In some stages of Li2MnO3 ab initio structure determination, different programs were used to check the reproducibility of the results. For example, ITO (Visser, 1969) and TREOR (Werner, Eriksson & Westdahl, 1985) were used for the automatic indexing procedure, while ALLHKL (Pawley, 1981) and EXTRA (Altomare et al., 1995) were used for the full-profile peak decomposition and extraction of the square structure-factor moduli (IFI2). The determination of the atomic positions of the structure was obtained by the direct-methods program SIRPOW.92 (Altomare et al., 1994), then the profile refinement, by the Rietveld method, was performed using DBWS (Wiles & Young, 1981) and WYRIET 3.5 (Schneider, 1989). 3. Results 3.1. Indexing To obtain precise peak positions, the profile-fitting program available in the Philips APD software was used. A set of the first 24 experimental diffraction peaks was used for the automatic indexing with programs ITO and TREOR that were tested with different values of the available options to verify the reproducibility of the results. Two monoclinic solutions, A and B, whose figures of merit and cell constants are reported in Table 1, were found by ITO with a twotheta-zero correction of 0.02 ° (value comparable with that usually measured with our instrumentation) and without correction, respectively. The same results are also proposed by TREOR (see Table 1): in this case, the A or B solutions are achieved depending on the value selected for the option 'maximum cell volume' (250 or 500 .~3, respectively). The cell constants agree quite well with those reported in the literature (see Table 1): the figures of merit are significantly higher for A according to the lower number of theoretical lines of this case with respect to the pertinent number for B (in Table 1 the number of theoretical lines is also reported). The A solution can explain all the observed lines with the minimum cell volume and has been selected for the determination of the space group. In Table 2, the experimental 20 peak positions are reported and compared with those calculated with ITO and TREOR; the Miller indices are also reported. The systematic absences (hkl: h + k = 2n + 1; hOl and 001: no conditions for/) are consistent only with the space groups C2, Cm and C2/m. 3.2. Extraction of the structure-factor moduli The full-profile fitting and peak decomposition were performed in the angular range 15 < 20 < 110 ° with the two programs ALLHKL and EXTRA using the pseudoVoigt and PearsonVII profile function, respectively: the IFI 2 set was extracted and the profile parameters and cell constants were refined. There is a satisfactory agreement between the results found with the two programs. The discrepancy factors obtained with ALLHKL are Rwp = 25.5% and Rp= 17.0% , while with EXTRA Rwp=29.90% and Rp=18.25% were obtained. As an example, Figs. l(a) and 1 (b) show the comparison between the observed and calculated pattern obtained after the full-profile fitting performed with ALLHKL and EXTRA, respectively. 3.3. Structure determination The SIRPOW.92 program was applied both to the IFI 2 set extracted by ALLHKL and by EXTRA, using the space group C2/m: independently of the set of IF[ 2 used for the structure determination, the same literature solution (Strobel & Lambert-Andron, 1988) was obtained, apart from a shift of the cell origin to 1⁄2,0,0. The atomic positions and occupancies determined with SIRPOW.92, the Fourier peak heights and the discrepancy factors obtained after the Fourier least-squares procedure are reported in Table 3; for comparison, the literature atomic positions (Strobel & Lambert-Andron, s16005767, 1997, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1107/S0021889896012460 by Univ Of CaliforniaMerced, Wiley Online Library on [13/05/2025].

The atomic positions found by SIRPOW.92 with IFI 2 set by EXTRA are obtained in a default way. Regarding the SIRPOW.92 application (set of IFI 2 by ALLHKL and EXTRA) to the space groups C2 and Cm, which have the same systematic absences as C2/m, the cell content determined disagrees with the stoichiometry of LizMnO3. On the other hand, these two space groups were already rejected on the basis of piezoelectric behaviour (Strobel & Lambert-Andron, 1988). 3.4. Structure refinement The structure data obtained in the previous step with space group C2/m were used as starting parameters in the model for the Rietveld profile refinement with WYRIET. The structural and profile parameters, according to the profile function PearsonVII, were evaluated with the procedure using the following order of variation: (i) scale factor, twotheta-zero correction and one background coefficient; (ii) cell parameters; (iii) three background coefficients; (iv) profile parameters; (v) atomic positions and isotropic thermal factors (the atomic coordinates were fixed before the next step); (vi) site occupancies. In each step, the parameters varied were added to the previous ones: 24 parameters were refined in the last stage. In Table 4 the values obtained for the refined parameters (atomic positions, isotropic displacement factors, occupancies and cell constants) and the discrepancy factors are reported. The comparison between the observed and calculated pattern and the difference curve is shown in Fig. 2 and the content of the unit cell is represented in Fig. 3. s16005767, 1997, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1107/S0021889896012460 by Univ Of CaliforniaMerced, Wiley Online Library on [13/05/2025].

Comparison between observed (dots) and calculated (solid line) X-ray patterns atter Rietveld refinement. In the lower part the difference curve is plotted and bars for the reflection positions are shown. In the indexing process the equivalence of the results proposed by programs TREOR and ITO can be seen; the latter calculates a complete list of hkl (see Table 2), nevertheless TREOR indexing allows the systematic absences and the symmetry of the compound to be unequivocally estimated. Moreover, it can be noted that, already in this indexing step, the ambiguity about the monoclinic space group to which Li2MnO3 belongs [C2/m (A) or C2/c (B)] is clarified and the pertinent figures of merit (see Table 1) allow the B solution to be rejected, for which many additional reflections were calculated, some of which having appreciable intensity (e.g. 021 and 023 reflections at 20=22.86 ° ) in angular regions where no reflection was observed. As previously discussed in {}3.2, the programs ALLHKL and EXTRA give comparable results in the peak decomposition and in the evaluation of the integrated intensities set. However, it can be underlined that the EXTRA program is really user friendly and more complete than ALLHKL: it can operate with all space groups. Moreover, previous data treatment (e.g. K~ 2 stripping, background evaluation and profile parameters estimates) can be automatically performed by EXTRA. Regarding the atomic positions search, it can be noted (see Table 3) that the solution agrees remarkably well with the single-crystal results, and the obtained values of R F are satisfactory. The structure parameters refinement with the Rietveld method starting from the atomic positions obtained by SIRPOW.92 led to values very close to the pertinent single-crystal data (Strobel & Lambert-Andron, 1988) (see Table 4). Regarding the isotropic thermal factor values, only for Lil site was a negative value of B found. This anomalous behaviour of the Lil atom has already been reported from both single-crystal and neutron powder data studies (Strobel & Lambert-Andron, 1988). For a better determination of the B value for the Li 1 site it was made possible to increase its electron density by considering variable occupation factors of Li and Mn on ~O1 @ 02 Mn Lil Li2 I.i3 Fig. 3.

Nevertheless, the quantity of substitional Mn, independently from its initial value, reaches a refined content lower than that found by Strobel & Lambert-Andron (1988) in samples synthesized by solid-state reaction. The simultaneous variation of temperature and occupation factors shows a correlation factor of ~, 70% and the refined values may be believed as reliable. Notwithstanding the presence of substitutional defect, the isotropic thermal factor remained negative and no other correction was made. The Rietveld procedure, performed on the basis of 14 structural parameters for 165 reflections in the pattern, gave a rather high goodness-of-fit value. However, the structural results can be considered in good agreement with the literature (Table 3 and 4). The discrepancy factors are also reported in Table 4. In Fig. 2 the comparison between observed and calculated patterns is shown. It may be observed that some inadequacy of the profile causes the underestimation of the calculated intensity for certain reflections: this may be attributed to the presence of microstructural effects as previously reported by Massarotti, Capsoni, Bini, Azzoni & Paleari (1997). A more complete analysis of the influence of crystallite size and microstrain on the peak shape of the Li2MnO3 phase will be the object of a further study. Finally, in spite of lower precision usually attributed to data collected from conventional X-ray powder diffractometers, the structure of Li2Mn03 was determined and the results agree with single-crystal data. It is also shown that presently available programs for treating powder X-ray diffraction data allow the ab initio structure determination even for low-symmetry crystalline compounds.

It is shown that such treatments result in a slight, but significant mass increase. Structural analyses show that the resulting spinel is a manganese-deficient spinel phase with lower cell parameter and higher manganese valence, and that the expelled manganese forms Mn2O3. The presence of this second phase, which was not identified in a recent study of oxygen annealing on this compound (Nakamura and Kajiyama, Solid State Ionics 133 (2000) 195), is compatible with the initial stoichiometry and does not require any oxygen vacancies in the initial LiMn2O4, as supposed earlier. The most likely formula of the resulting lithium-rich spinel with increased manganese valence is Li(Mn2e&e)O4 with e in the range 0.02–0.03 at 5 atm O2. r 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Keywords: Li–Mn–O system; Spinel; Oxygen annealing 1. Introduction The Li–Mn–O spinel system possesses a rich crystal chemistry. Without considering vacancies (cation/anion ratio strictly equal to 3/4), the formula of the spinel phase can vary along a solid solution Li1+aMn2aO4 with 0pao1/3, where a fraction of lithium replaces manganese on the 16d (octahedral) site of the spinel structure. This substitution range is actually limited not by crystal chemistry, but by the fact that manganese reaches the oxidation state +4 when a 1⁄4 1=3: The exact stoichiometry of Li1+aMn2aO4 samples (a value) of Li–Mn–O samples annealed in air has been shown to be determined by the annealing temperature [1,2]. The basic, strictly stoichiometric compound LiMn2O4, which has an average manganese valence +3.5, also undergoes a structural transition to an orthorhombic supercell on cooling at a temperature close to room temperature. Rousse et al. [3,4] showed that this symmetry lowering is due to partial charge ordering. To make matters more complex, LiMn2O4 is known to accommodate vacancies on all sites: (i) on the lithium 8a sites, in the well-known delithiation reaction which has been widely studied in view of lithium battery applications [5,6], (ii) on the manganese 16d site for specific low-temperature syntheses [7,8], (iii) on the oxygen 32e sites, in samples quenched from temperatures X800C [9,10]. In this context, it is interesting to investigate the evolution of LiMn2O4 when annealed under oxygen pressures larger than that in air. This study was also prompted by a report by Nakamura and Kajiyama, who found a significant lattice constant decrease on annealing LiMn2O4 in oxygen pressures up to 5 atm [11]. This effect was ascribed by these authors to an increase in average manganese valence, which could only occur in a single-phase spinel phase assuming the presence of oxygen vacancies in the initial, ‘‘stoichiometric’’ compound. Such a mechanism is in disagreement with numerous structural studies on LiMn2O4 prepared by the classical solid state route in air at high temperature with furnace or slow cooling, where no vacancies were found [12–14]. We will show here that the behaviour of ARTICLE IN PRESS Corresponding author. Fax: +33-476-881038. E-mail address: strobel@grenoble.cnrs.fr (P.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/S0022-4596(03)00189-0 LiMn2O4 when annealed in oxygen is more complex: it actually corresponds to a disproportionation of stoichiometric LiMn2O4 into a spinel with higher manganese valence on one hand, and the trivalent manganese oxide Mn2O3 on the other. Unlike the reaction mechanism proposed by Nakamura et al. [11], this reaction does not require the presence of oxygen vacancies in the initial material and is supported by X-ray and neutron data analyses. 2. Experimental LiMn2O4 was prepared by solid-state reaction of appropriate mixtures of reagent-grade lithium carbonate with (a) manganese carbonate or (b) a specially ground b-MnO2 oxide. The reactions were carried out in air at 800–850C with furnace-cooling. The reaction on annealing in the 400–500C range was first studied by thermogravimetry in air with 2C/min heating/cooling rate, using a Setaram CS 92 apparatus. Annealing under 1 atm oxygen were carried out by flowing 99.9% oxygen on LiMn2O4 samples placed in a tubular furnace for X24 h at 450–470C (optimum temperature according to thermogravimetric results). For annealing at pressures 41 atm, the sample was placed in a gold crucible in a stainless steel autoclave and submitted to oxygen pressure at 470C for 14–24 h. The oxygen pressure was maintained until the autoclave was cooled to at least 100C. The initial LiMn2O4 samples used were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Siemens D-5000 diffractometer with CuKa radiation) and by volumetric determination of the manganese oxidation state. Annealed samples were investigated using low-noise X-ray diffractometry (0.02 step size, X10 s counting time). The most oxidized sample (with lowest unit cell parameter) was measured on the high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer D2B at I.L.L., Grenoble with a wavelength of 1.594 A ̊ . Structural refinements were carried out by the Rietveld method using the Fullprof program [15]. 3. Results 3.1. LiMn2O4 characterization Both LiMn2O4 batches made from manganese carbonate and from ground b-MnO2 were phase-pure within the sensitivity of X-ray diffraction. Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Structural refinements from neutron data on data recorded above the orthorhombic– cubic transition temperature (TtrE294 K on cooling, 300 K on heating [3]) are given in Table 1. They are in excellent agreement with Refs. [4,12] and do not reveal any significant vacancy fraction as conjectured by Nakamura et al. [11] 3.2. Thermogravimetric study A 2C/min thermogravimetric curve of stoichiometric LiMn2O4 in air is shown in Fig. 1. Even in air [p(O2)E0.2 atm], a small, but significant mass uptake is observed in the range 400–500C. In Li–Mn–O spinel thermogravimetric studies, this phenomenon was usually masked by the much larger mass loss observed at temperatures 4750C, corresponding to the appearance of oxygen vacancies as established previously [9,16]. Further gravimetric measurements in oxygen up to 450C confirmed the occurrence of an irreversible mass uptake, equal to 0.19 mass% in 1 atm oxygen. 3.3. X-ray diffraction studies Fig. 2 shows powder diffraction patterns of pristine and oxygen-annealed LiMn2O4. A shift in peak positions towards higher diffraction angles can be observed. This corresponds to a decrease in unit cell parameter, in agreement with an increase in manganese valence.

Strobel et al. / Journal of Solid State Chemistry 177 (2004) 1–5 2 A plot of the evolution of cell parameter with oxygen pressure (see Fig. 3) shows that this effect varies with oxygen pressure and tends to saturate at p(O2)4E3 atm, in agreement with previous measurements [11]. A closer look at the diffraction patterns reveals the appearance of significant extra lines in oxygen-annealed samples. These new reflections reveal the presence of Mn2O3 in annealed samples. The presence of such a second phase, which was not at all considered in the previous work on oxygen-annealed LiMn2O4 [11], changes completely the reaction scheme of LiMn2O4 with oxygen. The manganese valence increase in the spinel phase can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) Formation of a Mn-cation vacant spinel LiMn2–e O4, with expelled manganese forming Mn2O3 as a second phase: LiMn2O4 þ ð3e=4ÞO2ðgÞ -LiMn2eO4 þ ðe=2ÞMn2O3; ðAÞ where the manganese valence in the spinel phase increases from 3.5 to 7/(2e). (ii) Migration of a fraction of lithium cations in the octahedral sites, resulting in a manganese-poorer spinel. Again, this frees manganese which can form Mn2O3 as a second phase: ð1 þ aÞLiMn2O4 þ ða=4ÞO2ðgÞ -Li1þaMn2aO4 þ ð3a=2ÞMn2O3; ðBÞ where the manganese valence in the spinel phase increases from 3.5 to (7a)/(2a). In addition, it should be noted that an oxidative mechanism including the migration of lithium and manganese cations has been proposed for the formation of cationdeficient spinels with formula close to Li2Mn4O9 [7]. 3.4. Neutron diffraction refinement A neutron diffraction pattern has been collected on diffractometer D2B of ILL, Grenoble, on the 5 atm O2 sample. Refinements results (see Fig. 4) are summarized in Table 2. This confirms the assumption of a slight manganese deficit on the spinel 16d site after oxygen annealing. However, such a refinement is unable to distinguish between reactions A and B: since Mn and Li both have negative Fermi lengths, similar solutions can be found with the 16d site occupied by either (0.98Mn+0.02Li) or a (0.99Mn+0.01&) combination.

Discussion At first sight, it seemed rather surprising to observe the formation of trivalent manganese oxide Mn2O3 on annealing a compound with initial manganese valence 3.5 in oxidating conditions. But it was systematically observed, and the structural analysis shows that it is more than compensated by the increase in manganese valence in the majority spinel phase: equilibrating reactions A and B actually requires extra oxygen, and the overall reaction is indeed a manganese oxidation. Because of the formation of a second, manganese-rich phase, no oxygen vacancies need to be postulated in the initial phase to explain the mass uptake reaction of LiMn2O4 in oxygen, unlike in the mechanism proposed previously [11]. The composition of the resulting spinels (defined by e or a; see reactions A and B above) can be inferred from (i) mass uptake measurements, (ii) 2-phase structural refinements. However, all these methods are rather inaccurate in the present case, due to the small fraction of the second phase. An independent determination of a in case B can also be provided from the evolution of the cell parameter a; which has been determined in the Li1+aMn2aO4 solid solution by several authors [1,17– 19]. Unfortunately, literature data for the a 1⁄4 f ðaÞ dependence are rather scattered, especially at low a value (even cell parameter values for a 1⁄4 0 quoted in these papers differ by E0.01 A ̊ ), again resulting in a poor accuracy. Table 3 summarizes values of e; a and manganese valence calculated from available experimental data. For reaction A, they give e values of 0.014 and 0.02–0.03 for oxygen pressures 1 and 5 atm, respectively. For reaction B, the results (a values) are more scattered. Going back to structural considerations, it should be pointed out that reaction B requires a much more complex rearrangement of the spinel network content than reaction A. Firstly, reaction B involves not only manganese loss from the 16d sites, but partial migration of lithium atoms to these empty octahedral sites. Secondly, a fraction of the initial spinel phase [(1+a) formula units] is also lost [1 spinel unit remaining]. Whereas the gaseous oxygen uptake in reaction A exactly matches the quantity required to form e=2 Mn2O3, the oxygen needed to form 3a=2 Mn2O3 in reaction B comes partly from the gaseous oxygen uptake, partly from the initial solid phase. Such a complex mechanism seems less likely to occur at relatively low temperatures such as 450C. Note that the temperature range used here is similar to that used to prepare other cation-deficient spinels with formulas more or less close to ‘‘Li2Mn4O9’’, i.e., (Li8/9&1/9) [Mn16/9&2/9]O4) in spinel formula notation [8,20]. All these considerations support reaction A, i.e., disproportionation of LiMn2O4 into a Mn-vacant spinel with higher manganese valence and Mn2O3.

P. Strobel et al. / Journal of Solid State Chemistry 177 (2004) 1–5 4 Finally, the oxidation of manganese in the spinel phase is substantiated not only by the decrease in cell parameter, but also by a decrease in Mn–O bond length. The value obtained for the 5 atm sample (Table 3) is intermediate between those in LiMn2O4 (1.958 A ̊ ) and in a cation-vacant spinel with manganese valence 3.82 (1.942 A ̊ ) (see Fig. 6 in Ref. [8]). 5. Conclusions In this study, we show that annealing stoichiometric LiMn2O4 under oxygen pressures in the range 1–5 atm results in a slight oxidation and introduction of manganese vacancies in the spinel phase, the manganese lost forming Mn2O3. This mechanism, which is actually a disproportionation of the initial Mn+3.5 present in LiMn2O4 into Mn3+ and Mn3.5+d, is quite compatible with the stoichiometry for the initial compound and does not require any undocumented assumption of oxygen vacancies in the initial, high-temperature-made LiMn2O4, unlike the mechanism recently proposed by Nakamura et al.

Relationship between the Electrochemical Behavior and Li Arrangement in LixMyMn2-yO4 (M ) Co, Cr) with Spinel Structure Tomoaki Kashiwagi,† Masanobu Nakayama,† Kyohei Watanabe,† Masataka Wakihara,*,† Yo Kobayashi,‡ and Hajime Miyashiro‡ Department of Applied Chemistry, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8552, Japan, and Materials Science Research Laboratory, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, 2-11-1, Iwado Kita, Komae-shi, Tokyo 201-8511, Japan ReceiVed: NoVember 2, 2005; In Final Form: January 16, 2006 The relationship between the electrochemical behavior and the arrangement of lithium/vacancies has been investigated with electrochemical Li removal in LixMyMn2-yO4 (x e 1.0, 0.0 e y e 0.3, M ) Co, Cr). It was shown that the electrochemical removal proceeds via two voltage regions: (1) ∼3.9 V at x g ∼0.5 and (2) ∼4.2 V at x e ∼0.5. To understand the stepwise behavior, entropy measurement of reaction, ∆Sobs, was performed by using the electrochemical methods. The changes of the sign in ∆Sobs from negative to positive at the composition x ∼0.50 in LixMyMn2-yO4 indicated that the ordered arrangement of Li/vacancies was formed with electrochemical Li removal. Moreover, such an ordering was suppressed by the substitution of Co3+ and Cr3+ for Mn3+. To clarify the nature and origin of Li/vacancy ordering, the Monte Carlo simulation was performed in view of Coulombic interaction. The simulation reproduced the formation of a new phase arising from Li/vacancy ordering at x ) 0.50 in LixMn2O4. In addition, the ordered arrangement of Li/vacancy at x ) 0.5 was perturbed by the trivalent M3+ replacement in spinel structure due to the local clustering of Li+ around M3+. Consequently, the electrochemical behavior in spinel LiMn2O4 was deeply related to the Coulombic interactions, proved by the fact that experimentally observed changes in entropy agreed well with Monte Carlo simulation based on the Coulombic interaction. Introduction Development of the cathode materials for Li ion battery is vital to meet the demands of portable devices, future usages of electric vehicles, and so on. Among the cathodes, LiMn2O4 and related oxides have gained much attention because of their low cost, low toxicity, and relatively high energy density.1-6 The structure of LiMn2O4 belongs to the spinel type structure (space group Fd3hm) in which oxygen forms cubic closed packing (ccp) and Mn and Li distributed in half of octahedral site (16d site) and 1/8 of tetrahedral site (8a site), respectively (see, Figure 1). During electrochemical charging and discharging, this material undergoes reversible lithium removal/insertion without changing the flame structure of Mn2O4.7 Although no significant structural changes were observed in this electrochemical reaction, measured potentials as a function of lithium content showed sudden increase from ∼3.9 to ∼4.2 V at x ∼0.5.7 Gao et al. reported that this phenomenon stemmed from the ordered arrangement of Li/vacancies with the results of electrochemical behavior and Monte Carlo simulation with empirical parameters of the lattice gas model.8 In this respect, the measurement of configurational entropy of reaction is one of the effective ways to investigate the ordering nature of LixMn2O4 quantitatively. Newman’s group has measured the entropy of reaction and performed the Monte Carlo simulation using Dahn’s model, showing good accordance between experimental and computational results.9,10 However, a question still exists, what kind of interaction leads to the formation of ordered structure, because their Monte Carlo simulation only takes into account the first and second neighbor interactions, and the potential parameters they used were estimated empirically. In addition, Van der Ven et al.11 and Ammundsen et al.12 supported this idea by using ab initio theoretical computation and spectroscopic methods, respectively, whereas Neutron diffraction patterns for half-delithiated samples showed no diffraction peak arising from superstructure formation of Li ordering reported by Liu et al.13 and Berg et al.14 Thus, the formation of ordered arrangement of Li/vacancies is still controversial. * Address correspondence to this author. † Tokyo Institute of Technology. ‡ Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry.

Another aspect of interest around LiMn2O4 materials is a metal substitution effect that improves the cycle performance for the usage of the lithium ion battery.15 The exact reasons for the improvements are still ambiguous, but Gummow et al.6 and Li et al.15 have pointed out the enhancement of the phase stability leads to good cyclability. Thus, the basic study regarding thermodynamics of LiMn2O4 and its relatives is important to understand their electrochemical behavior. In the present study, we examined entropy measurement of reaction for the spinels, LiMn2O4, and trivalent metal doped ones, LiCoyMn2-yO4 and LiCryMn2-yO4. In addition, to discuss the origin of ordered arrangement of Li/vacancies, Monte Carlo simulation was performed based on the Coulombic interaction. Experimental Section The samples of LiMyMn2-yO4 (y ) 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.30; M ) Co, Cr) were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction, and details have already been reported in the references.16,17 The mixture of stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, Co2O3, Cr2O3, and Mn2O3 (which was prepared by preheating of MnCO3 at 600 °C for 24 h) was used as the starting material. The mixture was heated at 820 °C for 3 days in air, then cooled at a rate of 0.5 deg/min. The phase identification and evaluation of lattice parameters were carried out by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, using Cu KR radiation (RINT-2500V, Rigaku Co. Ltd). The open circuit potential (OCP) data were measured with a three-electrode type cell. The working electrode was a mixture of 70 wt % sample powder, 25 wt % acetylene black (AB) as a current collector, and 5 wt % poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) as a binder, and the total weight of the materials was ∼100 mg to obtain the accurate molar amount of electrochemically removed lithium ions. Li foil (Aldrich) was used for the counter and the reference electrodes, and 1 M LiClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) was used as the electrolyte solution (Tomiyama Pure Chemical Company, Limited). The cell was charged with the current density of 0.05 C, and then the potential was relaxed for 6 h. The measured potential after relaxation was used as the OCP, EOCP, for the corresponding composition x. The entropy of reaction was estimated by the measurement of temperature dependence on OCP. The relationship between the OCP, EOCP, and changes in the entropy of reaction, ∆S, is given by following equation where T, n, and F indicate temperature, number of electrons participating in the reaction (in this case, n ) 1), and Faraday constants. In the present study, the measurement of the entropy was performed along with the electrochemical method referring to the method of Thomas et al.9 A coin-type cell was used because of its good heat conduction. For the working electrode, spinel powder, AB, and polyvinylidenfluoride (PvdF) binder were mixed at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 and dissolved into N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was coated onto a pure aluminum sheet dried at 120 °C in air for 12 h to vaporize the NMP, then cut into a disk. This disk with ∼10 mg of active material was used as the working electrode. Lithium metal and 1 M LiClO4 in EC/DEC were used as a counter electrode and electrolyte solution, respectively. The entropy measurement of reaction was performed according to the following temperature cycling operation. The cell was initially charged at a constant current of 0.05 C up to the various composition x in LixMyMn2-yO4 at 298 K in a thermostat. Next, the potential was relaxed for 6 h at the same temperature. To avoid the error of estimation of composition x, the molar amount of Li was again evaluated by using the OCP data obtained by a threeelectrode cell. (Note that quite small amounts of sample were used in coin-type cells for the entropy measurement of reaction. Therefore, it leads to a large error for the evaluation of composition x, due to the self-discharge reaction and so on.) After 6 h of relaxation, the temperature was linearly varied at a rate of 5 deg/h with the following three steps: the temperature was (1) raised from 298 to 303 K, (2) decreased from 303 to 293 K, and (3) raised again from 293 to 298 K. The results of the temperature dependence of the potential were fitted by the linear function, and the entropy of reaction ∆Sobs was obtained from eq 1. Note that gradual potential decrease (ca. -0.001 V/h) takes place during the relaxation step because of selfdischarging.8 To correct for the continual decrease of the cell potential, the potential profile of 298 K before and after temperature cycling was extrapolated by quadratic functions. The obtained potential profile during temperature cycling was subtracted from the approximated quadratic functions, and this corrected potential was used for the evaluation of ∆Sobs.

Chem. B, Vol. 110, No. 10, 2006 4999 of LiMn2O4 showed a good accordance with reported results of spinel LiMn2O4.18,19 The peaks are gradually shifted to the higher angle region, and no split of the peaks was observed with doping with Co and Cr ions. Thus, it was confirmed that only the single spinel phase was obtained in this compositional range (0 e y e 0.3). The variation of refined lattice parameter was presented in Figure 3. The observed lattice parameters were linearly decreased with doping, and the lattice parameters of Co-doped spinels were smaller than those of Cr-doped ones. Such behavior can be understood by the idea of ionic radii. Since the radii of trivalent Co3+, Cr3+, and Mn3+ ions are 0.685, 0.755, and 0.785, respectively,20 the replacement of Mn3+ by Co3+ and Cr3+ causes the shrinkage of the cell, and Cr3+ doping leads to a smaller decrease in the lattice parameter than Co3+ doping does. The OCP of the samples, LixMyMn2-yO4, are presented in Figure 4. Two potential regions of electrochemical reactions are distinctly observed in the OCP diagrams of LixMn2O4, showing ca. 3.9 V at the composition x > ∼0.5 (region I) and ca. 4.1 V at x < ∼0.5 (region II), respectively. The OCP of region I in LixMn2O4 showed a gradual increase with composition x, indicating the solid solution reaction proceeded. On the other hand, the OCP of region II remained constant during the composional range of ∼0.1 < x < ∼0.5. Therefore, a two-phase reaction, Li∼0.5Mn2O4 f Li∼0.1Mn2O4 + ∼0.4Li, was indicated in region II of LixMn2O4. This electrochemical behavior is consistent with the previous report by Ohzuku et al.7 No significant change was observed in the averaged potential for each two-potential region in Coor Cr-doped samples. However, by doping of Co or Cr ions into Mn sites, the features of the two-potential region were fading a little, or the potential monotonically increases with Li removal compared with that of LixMn2O4. Additionally, the two-phase coexistence reaction mechanism in region II of LixMn2O4 changed to a solid-solution type reaction in Coor Cr-doped spinels. (Note that the molar amount of lithium ions removed with the charging decreased with substitution in the present cutoff voltage region, since the molar number of Mn3+ ions in LiMyMn2-yO4 which contribute to oxidation/reduction with Li removal/insertion decreased with substitution of trivalent Co3+ or Cr3+ ions. On the other hand, Figure 4. Variation of the equilibrium potential for LixMyMn2-yO4 (M ) Co, Cr). For the sake of comparison, to the potentials of the samples with the composition y ) 0.05, 0.15, and 0.30 were added the values +0.05, +0.10, and +0.15 V, respectively. Figure 5.

The composition x was evaluated by referring to the OCP after 6 h relaxiation measured by a three-electrode cell as mentioned in the Experimental Section. Only the x values at the range of ∼0.1 e x e ∼0.5 for LixMn2O4 were evaluated from the integrated charging current with use of Faraday’s law, since no changes in OCP were observed (two-phase coexistence reaction). 5000 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 110, No. 10, 2006 Kashiwagi et al. only Mn3+ ions in LiMyMn2-yO4 varied their oxidation state from 3+ to 4+ in this voltage region.) The structural change with lithium insertion was evaluated by ex situ XRD, and the results are shown in Figure 5. Since the peak feature of the patterns was roughly unchanged with Li removal, the host structure of LixMyMn2-yO4 keeps its framework upon Li removal. In detail, the broad peaks were observed in LixMn2O4 between x ) ∼0.1 and ∼0.4, indicating split of the peaks arising from the two-phase coexistence. On the other hand, no peak split was observed in the corresponding composition x in Coor Cr-doped samples. Therefore, it was confirmed that the two-phase coexistence reaction took place in region II of LixMn2O4, whereas the solid solution type reaction proceeded at the corresponding composition (x < ∼0.5) of Coor Cr-doped samples as indicated by the OCP measurement mentioned above (Figure 3). Figure 6 shows an typical example of the potential change during temperature cycling, and the variation can be approximated by a linear function. Although the small hysteresis could be due to the delay of heat response observed, the effect of this hysteresis would be canceled by averaging the potential data of both the temperature increasing and decreasing cycles. In addition, no marked change was observed in the plot of Figure 6, when the rate of temperature cycling was slowed to 5 deg/ min, so that the relaxation for the change of temperature is fast enough to obtain the equilibrium state. The gradient with various composition x (dEOCP/dT, Figure 6) is proportional to the entropy of reaction, ∆Sobs, along with eq 1. (Note that this ∆Sobs includes the contribution of the reaction at the counter electrode. However, this contribution to ∆Sobs is considered to be constant in the whole compositional region, because the same metal solvation/deposition reaction, Li f Li+ + e-, proceeds at the counter electrodes.) The obtained dEOCP/dT of LixMn2O4 was plotted as a function of composition x in Figure 7. The measured dEOCP/dT is initially negative around x ∼1.0 and increased with lithium removal to be positive around x ∼0.7. Then a sudden decrease in dEOCP/ dT was recognized at x ∼0.5 where the change in OCP was observed, leading to a negative value of dEOCP/dT. In region II where the two-phase coexistence reaction took place, the dEOCP/ dT monotonically increased with Li removal. (Note that the interpretation for the variation of dEOCP/dT in the two-phase coexistence region is unclear. Maybe it contains the boundary formation of the two-phase domain in the crystal and so on.) The observed behavior of dEOCP/dT for parent LiMn2O4 showed good agreement with previous results.9 Therefore the two potential features observed in the OCP diagram would stem from the remarkable change in the ∆Sobs at x ∼0.5 because of oneto-one correspondence in potential change at x ∼0.5. For the samples of Co and Cr doping, the measured dEOCP/ dT was also shown in Figure 7, indicating similar behavior qualitatively to that of LixMn2O4. However, the changes in the absolute value of dEOCP/dT became smaller with an increase in Co or Cr doping in the spinel. For example, the local maximum value of dEOCP/dT around x ∼0.6 decreased with Co and Cr doping (Figure 7). In addition, the value of dEOCP/dT agreed with that of Coand Cr-doped samples when the same amount of trivalent cation M3+ (Co3+ or Cr3+) was doped in the spinel, even though the lattice parameter is different for each. (To confirm this, we replotted the dEOCP/dT of LixMyMn2-yO4 with the same y of Co and Cr doping as shown in Figure 8.) Discussion Hereafter, we discuss the details of the change in entropy of the reaction. Two conceivable effects contribute to the changes in entropy of the reaction: (1) vibrational and (2) configurational effects. Since the behavior of the entropy of reaction with x does not depend on the lattice parameter of spinels but on the molar amount of substitution y for both trivalent cations, M (see Figures 7 and 8), the contribution of vibrational entropy is negligibly small in this case. On the other hand, the configurational effect arising from the distribution of Li and vacancies is not directly related to the lattice parameter and that of doping metals. In this respect, it was suggested that the superstructure due to Li/vacancy ordering formed at the composition x ) 0.5 in LixMn2O4, where Li ions alternatingly occupy the tetrahedral 8a sites (see Figure 9) as proposed previously.7 Considering the extreme condition of this model, the entropy of the reaction Figure 8. dEOCP/dT as a function of x for Co or Cr doped spinels. Good accordance was observed in the values of dEOCP/dT when the amount of Co and Cr doping is equal. Figure 9. Schematic figure of the Li/vacancy ordering arrangement in the 8a site of the spinel structure (Fd3m). The Li(1) sites were occupied by a larger number of Li ions than the Li(2) sites. LixMyMn2-yO4 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 110, No. 10, 2006 5001 would vary as presented in Figure 10. The simulated dEOCP/dT was qualitatively similar to the observed dEOCP/dT, so that the variation of the entropy of reaction would be explained by the order/disorder arrangement of Li and vacancy in the tetrahedral 8a site network of spinel LixMn2O4. As mentioned in the previous section, the shape of the measured dEOCP/dT was unchanged but the value increased as y increased in LixMyMn2-yO4. Hence the degree of the ordering/ disordering of Li/vacancy would be affected by the changes in host structure as indicated in the previous results. In detail, the variation of the measured dEOCP/dT depended only on composition y and not the sort of metal (Co or Cr) or lattice parameter. The common feature of Co and Cr substitution is its oxidation state of trivalent metal, so that it is suggested from these results that the Coulombic interaction between Li/vacancy and the host structure is important in understanding the measurement of dEOCP/dT. To verify the above assumption, the Monte Carlo simulation that concerns only Coulombic interaction was carried out. The Coulombic term of the lattice enthalpy was expressed by the following equations: where Ui and UCoulomb indicate the site potential of site i and the total Coulombic energy per unit cell, respectively. Ze is the electrical charge of the ions, ε0 is the dielectric constant in a vacuum, and rij is the interionic distance between ions i and j. In practice, the Ewald method was used for the determination of UCoulomb (this is a method where the conditionally convergent Coulombic sum is transformed into a sum of two rapidly converging sums: a sum in real space and a sum in reciprocal space. Details are described in ref 21). Table 1 shows the structural parameters and oxidation state of modeled crystal LiMyMn2-yO4. It was assumed that only Mn ions compensate for the electron transfer of redox reaction during charging and discharging, and they possess the averaged oxidation state as listed in Table 1 (the range is +3.5 to +4). The charge Ze of doped metal ions M was fixed as +3, and the random distribution of doped M is assumed as indicated in present XRD results (Figure 2: no peaks arising from superstructure were observed). Note that present simulation method does not consider the repulsive interaction arising from overlapping of electron clouds, van der Waals interaction, and so on, which factors would be included in the formation of the previous approach.8,10 This makes the present discussion half-quantitative. However, it is worthwhile to point out that the present method enables the simulation without empirical or adjustable parameters, so that one can simulate the electrochemical simulation without experimetal data. In addition, the physical meaning or the origin of the interaction is more apparent, since the present Figure 10. Simulated dEOCV/dT as a function of composition x in LixMn2O4, when Li ions selectively remove from initially Li(2) sites and then the Li(1) site (see Figure 9).

Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 110, No. 10, 2006 Kashiwagi et al. method only considers the Coulombic interaction. By using the Coulombic interaction, the Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the appropriate arrangement of Li and vacancy. Nevertheless, it was well-known that the computation of Coulombic interaction takes a long time due to its form of long-range interaction. To reduce the Monte Carlo step, the site u that had relatively larger site-potential Uu was selectively flipped, and only ground-state configuration (i.e., most stable arrangement of Li/vacancy) for each composition x was simulated in this study. Figure 11 showed the variation of the formation energy in LixMyMn2-yO4, which is defined as obtained Coulombic energy, using Monte Carlo simulation, with subtraction of the Coulombic energy assuming the averaged charge (AVC) distribution listed in Table 1. The results showed convex shaped curves where the energetic minimum was found at x ) 0.5 for the modeled structure of any composition y. In addition, the resulting formation energy does not vary widely from composition to composition, indicating the present results reproduced the random distribution of Cr statistically. As the composition y increased, the convex function of the formation energy became well-round. Since the derivative of the formation energy corresponds to the OCP, it was expected that the electrochemical reaction proceed via the two voltage region at the border of x ) 0.5, and substitution of the trivalent metal cation weakens the flat voltage curve at each voltage region observed in LixMn2O4. (In other words, the two-phase coexistence reaction tends to proceed when the number of substituents M3+ is small.) Such simulated results qualitatively showed good accordance with the experimental observation as mentioned in the previous section. Accordingly, changes in the voltage as a function of x and y in LixMyMn2-yO4 (M ) Co or Cr) around 3.5-4.2 V would be explained solely by the optimization of Coulombic interaction. To understand the thermodynamic phenomena (Figure 11) from the viewpoint of the atomic level, the arrangement of Li/ vacancy at the ground state was investigated. Figure 12a shows a snapshot of Li/Vacancy arrangements in the simulated Li0.5Mn2O4, showing the ordered arrangement as suggested previously where Li ions alternatingly occupied the tetrahedral 8a site (Figure 9). Figure 13 presents the variation of site occupancy of Li as a function of x in LixMn2O4. Around x ) 1 and 0, no difference in site occupancy was observed in Li(1) and Li(2) sites, indicating the disordered arrangement of Li/vacancy kept in this region. While the difference increases around intermediate composition x, perfect ordering was indicated in x ) 0.5 of Figure 13. Variation of the site occupancy for Li ions as a function of x in LixMyMn2-yO4. The definitions of Li(1) and Li(2) sites were given in Figure 9. Figure 14. Variation of the averaged coordination number of neighboring Li ions around Mn and M3+ cations. LixMyMn2-yO4 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 110, No. 10, 2006 5003 LixMn2O, where Li and vacancy sites arrange alternately (Figure 12a). Therefore, the charging reaction of LiMn2O4 proceeds via three steps: disordering-ordering-disordering of Li/vacancy between Li(1) and Li(2) sites. By adding the substituents of M3+, the difference in site occupation at around x ) 0.5 was decreased, indicating the M3+ ions interrupted the ordered arrangement of Li/vacancies. Such a M3+ doping effect would lead to the bending of the potential profile, whereas the perfect ordering of Li/vacancy causes the flat potential at regions I and II in LixMn2O4. To elucidate the effect of trivalent cation M3+ for the arrangement of Li/vacancy, the averaged coordination number (averaged CN) of the Li ion, which is the nextneighboring Li of octahedral Mn and M3+, was computed and shown in Figure 14. The linear increase from 0 to 6 in averaged CN of the next neighbor Li is expected as a function of x under the assumption that the distribution of Li ions is independent of that of M3+/Mn ions. The averaged CN of Li around Mn is almost identical with the expectation mentioned above, while that around M3+ ions is larger than the expected behavior. On the other hand, the tetrahedral cation sites next to the M3+ ions tend to be selectively occupied by the Li ions. Maybe this stems from the smaller repulsive Coulombic interaction between Li and the trivalent M cation than Li and Mn, since the oxidation state of M3+ is smaller than that of Mn sites. Hence substituted M3+ ions would cause the Li cluster around them, which leads to the break of ordered arrangement of Li/vacancy at composition x ) 0.5. Figure 12b shows the snapshot of the arrangement of cations in Li0.5MyMn2-yO4 from the Monte Carlo simulation, and one can see the break of ordered arrangement of Li/vacancy due to the cluster formation of Li around M3+ cations. Such a break of Li/vacancy ordering would result in the bending of the potential profile mentioned above. Accordingly, present Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the observed electrochemical behavior of LixMyMn2-yO4 can be understood by the two Coulombic interactions of Li/vacancy ordering and formation of Li cluster around trivalent M ions. In conclusion, the present study reveals that the macroscopic electrochemical behavior of LixMyMn2-yO4 cathode materials is deeply related to the atomic level Coulombic interactions, which is clarified by the combined experimental and computational techniques. It is worthwhile to stress that Coulombic interaction is one of the key factors in designing materials and predicting the electrochemical behavior from atomic-scale interaction to macroscopic phenomena.

JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY 3, 142-147 (1981) Preparation of a New Crystal Form of Manganese Dioxide: A-MnO, JAMES C. HUNTER Union Carbide Corporation, P.O. Box 6116, Cleveland, Ohio 44101 Received January 12, 1981; in revised form March 9, 1981 Treatment of the spinel-type material LiMneO, with aqueous acid was found to result in conversion of the LiMn,O, to nearly pure MnOe, while preserving the structural framework of the L&+0,. The resulting material, designated A-MnOg, thus has a structure related to spinel, but with most of the lithium removed from the tetrahedral sites. The conversion of LiMnzOl to A-MnOz results in some contraction of the lattice, as evidenced by a reduction in the lattice constant a, from 8.24 to 8.03 A. A mechanism for the conversion of LiMqOI to A-MnO* is proposed, which involves solid state diffusion of lithium in the structure, in a manner analogous to the proton diffusion which occurs during the cathodic reduction of y-MnO,. Introduction MnOz and related manganese (IV) oxides are known to exist in a wide variety of structural forms. There are the materials pMnOz (pyrolusite) and ramsdellite, which are relatively pure MnOz ; and others such as cr-MnOz, &MnO, , y-MnO, , etc., which contain significant amounts of other ions as integral parts of the structure. The structural relationships between these various materials have been described by Wells (I) as well as in recent reviews by Burns and Bums (2,3). The structures can be described in terms of octahedra composed of oxygen atoms with manganese atoms in the center. The various structural forms are then built up by linking these octahedra together in various ways. For most of the MnOz materials, the structure can be described as consisting of parallel chains of edge-linked manganeseoxygen octahedra, linked together in various ways. Thus pyrolusite @MnO,) con142 0022-4596/81/110142-06!$02.00/0 Copyri&t @ 1981 by Academic Pnss, Inc.

In ramsdellite there are double chains of octahedra, connected to other double chains by corner sharing. These two materials can also be viewed in terms of a distorted hexagonally close packed oxygen framework with manganese atoms placed in certain octahedral sites in the framework. Other ways of joining together chains of manganese-oxygen octahedra give rise to a-MnOz (cryptomelane) and psilomelane. In these structures there are parallel tunnels which are large enough to contain other species, such as potassium, sodium, barium, or lead in the case of ti-MnOz, and barium or potassium in the case of the psilomelane structure. In these structures, because of the large open tunnels present, the oxygen framework is not close packed. 6-Mn02 has a layer structure, with sheets made from manganese-oxygen octahedra, separated by alkali or other ions, and water. y-Mn02, the material most commonly used as a cathode material in dry-cell batMANGANESE DIOXIDE 143 teries, is considered to be a disordered intergrowth of the /3-Mn02 and ramsdellite structures (3), thus consisting of a random arrangement of single and double chains of MnOs octahedra. There are some manganese (IV) containing compounds with structures based on a cubic closest packing (ccp) oxygen arrangement. Thus Li,MnO, is proposed to have both lithium and manganese (IV) on octahedral sites in a ccp oxygen framework (4), while LiMn,O, has the spine1 structure, with lithium in tetrahedral sites and manganese (III) and manganese (IV) in octahedral sites of a ccp oxygen framework (5). In addition, some lower valent manganese compounds such as ZnMn,O, and Mn30, are based on ccp or distorted ccp oxygen arrangements. In the work reported here, it was discovered that one could convert the spine1 structure, LiMn,O,, to substantially pure MnOz while maintaining a structure derived from the spinel, i.e., with nearly all of the lithium removed from the tetrahedral sites, and with manganese remaining on the octahedral sites in the ccp oxygen framework. Experimental Synthesis of LiMn204. LiMn,O, was made as described by Wickham and Croft (5), by mixing appropriate amounts of Li,CO, and a manganese oxide and heating at 850°C in air. L&CO, was Baker reagent grade. Manganese oxides used include Mn,O, (98%) and Mn304, from ALFA; and MnO (99%) horn ROC/RIC. Conversion of LiMn204 to A-MnO,. For conversion of LiMn,O, to h-Mn02, a 15-g sample of LiMn,O, was placed in a beaker containing 400 ml water, and a solution of dilute acid (H,SO,, HN4, or HCl) was added, with stirring, and while monitoring the solution pH. The solutions were stirred for approximately 45 min after the pH was stabilized at a particular value. Addition of acid was halted at a series of solution pH values, to see the effect of solution pH on completeness of conversion. After the acidtreatment, the solution was then decanted and the remaining solid material washed by decantation, filtered in a sintered glass filter, and dried in air at 90°C. Chemical analysis. Samples were analyzed for percentage of Mn and for manganese peroxidation using the ferrous sulfatepotassium permanganate titration method. Lithium content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy. X-Ray difraction. X-Ray powder dilfraction analysis was performed using unfiltered Fe& radiation, or CuKcv radiation (with a graphite monochrometer), using a scintillation counter detector. In addition, unit cell dimensions of h-MnO, were determined from high-angle X-ray diffraction data obtained using a Debye-Scherrer powder camera. Thermal analysis. Thermal analyses were performed using a DuPont Model 950 thermogravimetric analyser and a DuPont Model 900 differential thermal analyzer with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) cell. Results and Discussion The synthesis of LiMn204 proceeded as described by Wickham and Croft (5)) giving a blue powder with the proper X-ray pattern (ASTM card No. 18736), and whose chemical analysis matched that expected for LiMn,O, (see Table I). The solid state reaction between the L&CO3 and manganese oxide proceeded rapidly, being largely complete in 1 hr, when the manganese oxide used was Mn,O, . When lower valent oxides such as Mn30, were used, or when the amount of material was larger, longer heating times and multiple heatings were necessary to get complete reaction. (The solid state reaction to form LiMn,O, was recently investigated by Schutte et al. (6).) 144 JAMES C.

After treating a sample with a solution of H,S04 at pH2, a blue-black solid remained, yet there was a weight loss of approximately 29% from the starting LiMn,O, to the final product. Analysis of the resulting material revealed that it was now a substantially pure manganese dioxide, with manganese peroxidation near 100% (i.e., manganese oxidation state near four), and with most of the lithium removed (See Table I). Chemical analysis of the solution revealed that it contained the lithium that had been removed from the LiMn,O, as well as the manganese, which was in the form of Mn2+. Even more surprising was the X-ray diffraction pattern of the resulting material. It had much the same pattern, in terms of relative line positions and intensities, as the LiMn,O,, but with the lines shifted to slightly lower d values (Figs. la and b). Thus the pattern (with the exception of a weak line with a d value of 2.05 A, attributed to some remaining LiMn,O,) could be indexed on a cubic unit cell, with lattice constant a, = 8.03 8, as compared to a lattice constant of 8.24 A for LiMn204 (see Table II). Since the X-ray scattering factors for manganese and oxygen are so much larger than for lithium, the diffraction pattern of FIG. 1. X-Ray powder diffraction patterns (CL&I radiation) of (a) LiMn,O,. (b) A-MnO, resulting from pH 2 acid treatment of LiMn,O,. LiMnzOl is due mainly to the manganese and oxygen atoms. The great similarity of this pattern to that of the acid-treated LiMn,O, thus implies that the latter material has the same arrangement of manganese and oxygen atoms as in the spinel, but with a slightly smaller unit cell. From the X-ray data and the analytical results, therefore, it appears that acid treatment of LiMn204 leads to formation of a manganese dioxide of unique structure, derived from the spine1 structure of LiMn,O, but with most of the lithium removed from the tetrahedral sites. This material has been given the designation of A-MnO, . This type of structure has been described TABLE II X-RAY DIFFRACTION DATA FOR LiMn,O, AND A-MnO, hkl 111 311 222 400 331 333,511 440 531 A-MnOZ LiMn,O, d&ASTM 18-736) dabs d,,,, 4.72 4.64 4.636 2.47 2.42 2.421 2.37 2.31 2.318 2.05 2.01 2.008 1.88 1.84 1.842 1.58 1.55 1.545 1.45 1.42 1.420 1.39 1.35 1.357 MANGANESE DIOXIDE 145 by A. F. Wells in his book, “Structural Inorganic Chemistry” (7). He notes that such a structure, related to spine1 but with the tetrahedral sites vacant, is not adopted by any binary compound, although a distorted version of the structure is present in atacamite, Cu,(OH),Cl. He also notes that there are no apparent reasons that such a structure cannot exist for a binary compound. Apparently A-Mn02 is such a compound. From the lattice constant of 8.03 A, a density of 4.46 g/cm3 can be calculated for A-MnOz compared to a measured value of 4.49 g/cm3. A model has been developed to explain the conversion of LiMn,O., to X-Mn02. The results of chemical analyses of the product and of the treating solution are consistent with the overall reaction: 2LiMn,O, + L&O + 3Mn0, + MnO, where the lithium oxide and manganous oxides dissolve in the acidified treatment solutions. The real question is how this could occur without totally disrupting the LiMn,O, structure. A dissolution-precipitation type mechanism is unlikely, since under the conditions of the acid treatment manganese is soluble only in the divalent state. The bulk of the manganese in LiMn,O, would therefore be insoluble. Conceivably, one could dissolve lithium oxide from the surface of the LiMnzOd particles and also dissolve manganese (II) oxide (some disproportionation of 2Mn(III) + Mn(II) + Mn(IV) at the surface would be needed). However, one would soon reach the point where the entire surface would consist of manganese (IV) oxide, and the conversion would stop. Since the conversion in fact does not stop, one must propose a model which effectively allows difision of lithium and manganese (III) through the bulk of the crystal. This can be done by invoking a mechanism somewhat analogous to that proposed by A. Kozawa and R. A. Powers (8) for the cathodic reduction of yMnO, in alkaline electrolyte, but in reverse. In the y-MnOz reduction, the MnO, is reduced to MnOOH at the surface. The protons then diffuse to the interior of the particle, and electron hopping in the same direction occurs (Fig. 2a). This has the same effect as if the Mn(III) on the surface had diffused inward. In the case of LiMnzOl it can be thought of as analogous to y-MnO, discharged to 0.5 electron equivalent. It consists of 50% Mn(II1) and 50% Mn(IV) with Li+ replacing H+. As the Li+ and Mn2+ are removed from the surface by the acid solution, more lithium ions diffuse to the surface, accompanied by electron hopping (Fig. 2b). Thus, the dissolution can continue until all the lithium is removed and the manganese is all in the four-valent state. In all, 25% of the initial manganese will be removed from the surface of the particles; the interiors of the t Mn3+ OHMn3+ OHMn3+ OHMn4+ 0= Mn4+ OHO= Mn3’ Mn4’ OHOLiMn4’ 0’ Mn3’ Mn4’ 0: Mn3’ OLi i 4+-3+ ; Mn-,;O, -4 O$Yv$+e + MnOLi OLL Mn4’ Mn3’ OLi Mn4’ 0= into solution FIG. 2.

HUNTER particles will be left intact, though some contraction of the lattice will occur because of the loss of the lithium. LiMn,O, was treated with acid solutions under a variety of pH conditions. Analytical data for these samples are included in Table I. Conversion of LiMn,O, to A-Mn02 is substantially complete when the pH of the treating solution is below approximately pH 2.5. Thus there was little ditference seen between samples treated at pH 2 or 1. When LiMn,O, is treated at higher pH’s the conversion is incomplete. Above pH 5 very little conversion occurs. Even at a pH of 1 or 2 some lithium remains in the structure, and the manganese is not totally converted to the four-valent state. The reason for this inability to get complete conversion to a pure MnO, is not presently clear. X-Ray diffraction data revealed that in the case of the partially converted LiMn,O, there were peaks present due to both the LiMnzOl and A-MnOz structures. That is, the conversion did not proceed in a single phase with a gradual change in the lattice parameter, rather, it involved formation of separate regions of the A-MnO, phase with the LiMn,O, particles. Thermogravimetric analysis of A-MnO, in nitrogen atmosphere revealed little weight loss (< 1%) occurring at temperatures up to 400°C. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that seen for pyrolusite (pMnO,) (9), although the amount of weight loss for A-MnO, was somewhat higher than seen for fi-MnO,. In contrast, y-MnO, is known to undergo a weight loss of several percent under the same conditions ( IO), largely due to loss of water from the structure. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) results for y-MnO, and P-MnO, have been reported in the literature (9, 10). In the case of &MnO, , an endothermic peak is seen in the temperature range of 500-6WC, corresponding to conversion of P-MnO, to Mn,O,. For y-MnO, there is a broad endothermic region in the region from 100 to 4Oo”C, corresponding to loss of water from the material, followed by a small exothermic peak at about 400°C corresponding to conversion to /3-MnO,, and then a large endothermic peak between 500 and 600°C corresponding to conversion to Mn,O, . Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurements on y-MnOz and P-MnO, gave similar results to those reported in the literature. DSC analysis of A-MnOz gave results quite different from y-MnOz or @MnO,. The A-MnO, had a large exothermic peak at 258°C. The peak position was the same whether the DSC was performed in nitrogen or in air. An endothermic peak was found at 518°C in nitrogen and at 565°C in air. The nature of the exothermic peak at 258°C was clarified by X-ray powder diffraction of A-MnOz samples which were heated for 30 min in air at 200, 300, or 4OfPC, followed by cooling in air. The sample heated at 200°C still had the A-MnO, pattern, while the sample heated at 300°C had the peaks of p-MnOz, with very little of the A-MnO, pattern remaining. For the WC material, the pattern was also that of P-MnO,, with some improvement in the sharpness of the peaks. Thus the exothermic peak seen in the DSC analysis of AMnOz corresponds to conversion to pMnO,. The endothermic peak seen in the 500-600°C range is then the well-known pMnOz + Mn,O, transition. Thus the evidence suggests that A-Mn02, like y-MnO,, is a metastable form of MnO, that, upon sufficient heating, reverts to the more stable P-MnO, form.

Structural investigations by X-ray powder diffraction, applied to the LiMnO compounds, indicate the formation of a second crystalline phase, Li2MnO3 (space group C2/m), with the increasing lithium content. Total Li+ content per unit cell and the cation distribution over a spinel lattice in LixMn3−xO4 have been studied by measurements of integrated intensities of X-ray reflections, and by structure refinement using Rietveld profile analysis. In an attempt to understand the factors affecting cation distribution in the spinel lattice, we applied the computer modelling techniques and investigated the Li+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ ion distribution by calculating the lattice energy, combined with energy minimisation procedures, using the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP), a program designed for simulation of ionic and semi-ionic solids, based on interatomic potential models. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction A large number of studies on the synthesis of spineltype lithium manganese oxides have been carried out, since they are important as electrode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries (Winter et al., 1998). Series of oxides LixMn3−xO4 (15x51.33) can be obtained in a temperature range from 350 to 900°C (Koksbang et al., 1996). The oxidation number of manganese and composition of the manganese oxides are dependent on the reaction conditions, such as temperature, starting materials and atmosphere. The LiMnIIIMnIVO4 spinel is easily formed at temperatures above 700°C, and Li1.33MnIV 1.67O4 (Li4Mn5O12) spinel under low temperature conditions, below 500°C (Feng et al., 1999). Studies on the lithium ions content and distribution in the spinel lattice reveal, however, the existence of other spinel stoichiometries, with either cation deficiency or cation excess (Strobel et al., 1996). It was shown that in Li-rich systems the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase coexists with the spinel phases (Strobel and Lambert-Andron, 1988). The precise determination of the spinel unit-cell content is rather complicated, because of uncertainty in the experimentally-determined oxidation degree of manganese ions. The discrepancy also appears in the precise determination of Li+ content and distribution in a given sample, depending on the method used.

The present report deals with a combination of experimental and computational methods applied for the structure refinement, enabling a comparison of structure parameters determined by X-ray diffraction, with the data obtained from the interatomic potentials and lattice energy calculations. 2. Materials and methods Series of LiMnO compounds have been obtained by solid state reaction at 600°C of Li2CO3 with the tetragonal spinel precursors, hydrohausmannite, Mn3−d(O,OH)4 (Series I and III) and hausmannite, Mn3−dO4 (Series II), prepared by autoclaving Mn(OH)2 at 150°C and its dehydration at 500°C, respectively (Kaczmarek and Wolska, 1993a,b). X-ray diffraction studies were performed with a computerised TUR-61 (HZG-3) diffractometer employing the Mn-filtered FeKa radiation. For structural refinements the Rietveld program package GSAS was used (Larsen and Von Dreele, 1987). Measurements of integral intensities of X-ray powder diffraction lines appear to be the most informative about the distribution of Li+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ cations in the spinel structure of LixMn3−xO4. The intensities, Ihkl, may be calculated for different models, assuming variable unit-cell content, based on the relation Ihkl= Fhkl 2·p·(L−P), where Fhkl stands for the structure factor (Fhkl=Sfj·exp[2pi(hxj+kyj+lzj)]), p is the multiplicity number, L−P the Lorentz-polarisation factor, fj form factor (International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography, 1962). In particular, the spinel (Fd3m) X-ray pattern shows among other reflections whose intensities depend on tetrahedral (220, 422) or octahedral (222) cation positions. For example, a decrease in the 222-line intensity points out on the lithium for manganese substitution in the octahedral 16d Wyckoff positions (Wolska, 1996). All calculations performed in this study employed the static lattice computer code, General Utility Lattice Program (GULP; Gale, 1996), which is based on the Born model of ionic lattice, and from which the structure and crystal properties may be calculated. 3.

Unit-cell parameter values, a, obtained for the spinel phases formed in Series I–III (see text). For standard deviations compare Table 2. In the series with a nominal LixMn3−xO4 stoichiometry, with 0.55x52.0, the well crystallized cubic spinel phase was accompanied by the tetragonal hausmannite, Mn3O4, and/or bixbyite, a-Mn2O3, when xB 1, whereas the monoclinic Li2MnO3 phase was formed beside the spinel phase, for x\1.33. Results of accurate measurements of the spinel unit cell parameter, a, are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The distinct dispersion of the lattice constant values obtained for the same nominal stoichiometries in series I, II and III, indicate the differences of both the lithium content and of the oxidation degree of manganese in the spinel structures. We have undertaken a detailed investigation of the lithium ions distribution over the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of spinel lattice, and on the Li:Mn ratio limits, using the Rietveld structure refinement method on the X-ray powder diffraction line profiles. Although the changes in the manganese oxidation degree do influence, only slightly, the intensity of X-ray reflection phase LixMn3−xO4 spinel takes place for rather limited quantities of lithium. It appears that the stoichiometry of LiMnO compounds also depends on the hydroxylation degree of the manganese oxide precursors.

Observed, calculated and difference profiles resulting from the Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data collected in LiMn2O4 (space group Fd3m). profiles resulting from the Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction data collected on LiMn2O4, are shown in Fig. 3. It has to be stressed, that the Li1.33Mn1.67O4 patterns are very similar, which may cause the uncertainty in determination of the crystallographic positions of such light atoms as lithium, by X-ray diffraction techniques (Wolska et al., 1999). Measurements of the integrated intensity ratios of the single X-ray reflections for the same samples, presented in Table 3, compared with the intensities calculated for (Li)tetr[MnIIIMnIV]octO4 and (Li)tetr[Li0.33MnIV 1.67]octO4 models, confirm that the lithium ion limits in the LixMn3−xO4 spinel structure is not easy to determine. Application of modelling methods, based on the interatomic potentials independently derived for the relevant binary oxides (Lewis and Catlow, 1985; Catlow et al., 1994), enables the calculation of lattice energy and the refinement of crystal structure (Gale, 1996). Results presented in Table 4, indicate a slight increase of energy with the increasing lithium content in the spinel lattice LixMn3−xO4, and the decrease of the unit cell constant, a, from 8.267 to 8.059 A, , for x=1 and x=1.33, respectively. These values should be compared to other results obtained, i.e. experimental: 8.2460 and 8.1900 (Hill et al., 1979), 8.232 and 8.162 (Thackeray and Rossouw, 1994), 8.2536(9) and 8.1908(3) A, (this study) and calculated on the basis of ionic radii and oxygen parameters: 8.2810 and 8.2277 A, (Shannon, 1976; Hill et al., 1979). We believe that the progress in evaluation of interatomic potentials, by taking into consideration their strong dependence on the coordination number, will improve the consistency of calculations and experiments, and it will be possible to predict the lithium ion distribution over the spinel cationic positions (Woodley et al., in press).

The structure of Li4Mn5O12 crystallites was found to be cubic spinel using Rietveld refinement of both neutron and X-ray powder diffraction profiles. We confirmed that lithium ions occupy both the tetrahedral sites 8a and part of the octahedral sites 16d, but not the 16c sites in the space group Fd31 m, while all the manganese ions occupy the 16d sites. The lattice parameter was found to be sensitive to synthesis temperature as a result of the variation in manganese valence. The presence of Mn31 leads to the formation of a stoichiometric spinel Li[LixMn22x]O4 in which x decreases from 1/3 (Li4Mn5O12) to 0 (LiMn2O4), with concomitant formation of Li2MnO3 depending on the synthesis conditions. ( 1997 Academic Press 1. INTRODUCTION Lithium manganese oxides have been extensively studied as the cathode materials for advanced rechargeable lithium batteries because they offer high cell voltage, good rechargeability, and a wide operating temperature range with a much lower cost compared to LiNiO2 and LiCoO2. Particular attention has been given to the spinels LiMn2O4 (1—4), Li4Mn5O12 (5—8), and Li2Mn4O9 (9, 10). Currently, the spinel Li[LixMn2~x]O4 (0.03(x(0.10) is becoming more attractive because it shows better cycling performance. It was found that the onset of the structural changes caused 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed. by the Jahn—Teller distortion upon deep discharging could be suppressed by introducing a small amount of Li ions into the 16d sites to keep the average Mn oxidation state slightly above 3.5 (2, 11). It is the current consensus that a wide range of solid solution exists within the Li—Mn—O family of spinel compounds, and that the composition of the spinel electrode plays a very important role in controlling the rechargeability of the electrode (3). Therefore, attention should be paid to the control of the synthesis process to obtain single-phase samples with the required stoichiometry. Understanding the structural changes during the synthesis process is crucial for both process control and understanding the variation of the voltage, the capacity, and the cycling performance of Li/spinel cells. Studies on Mn4` defect spinels Li2O · yMnO2 (y" 2.5—4) with end members Li4Mn5O12 (y"2.5) and Li2Mn4O9 (y"4) are, however, limited to those poorly crystallized powders obtained from the solid state reaction of Li2CO3 or LiOH, and MnCO3 or MnO2 at temperatures below 400°C, because the concomitant formation of Mn3` occurs by the reduction of Mn4` when the reaction temperature is raised above 400°C. Recently we reported that well-crystallized Li4Mn5O12 can be prepared at a temperature up to 700°C from a eutectic mixture by using lithium acetate LiOAc and manganese nitrate Mn(NO3)2 as starting materials (6, 7). The structure of Li4Mn5O12 crystallites was previously studied by X-ray powder diffraction. Ideally, Li4Mn5O12 with all Mn ions in the 4# oxidation state should be isostructural to the spinel LiMn2O4 with the cation distribution (Li)8a[Li1@3Mn5@3]16dO4, in which oxygen ions form a cubic-close-packed array occupying 32e sites of the space group Fd31 m; Li ions occupy 8a sites 74 0022-4596/97 $25.00 Copyright ( 1997 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. (one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites), and co-occupy 16d sites (half of the octahedral sites) with Mn ions. Experimentally, however, we found the oxidation state of manganese to be somewhat lower than 4.0, since it is very difficult to eliminate the presence of Mn3` in the Li4Mn5O12 samples, which can be better expressed as Li4Mn5O12~d (0(d40.25). The distribution of Li ions, which determines the performance of the electrode, is also difficult to determine because Li is a very weak X-ray scatterer. In this study, we have focused on the confirmation of the cation distribution and structural changes caused by the presence of Mn3`. Since the spinel Li4Mn5O12 can only be prepared in powder form, the structural information is best obtained using profile refinement methods. Here we use the well-established Rietveld method (12) to analyze both the X-ray and neutron powder diffraction profiles of Li4Mn5O12 prepared at various temperatures. Our structural results agree with those previously reported, but are more quantitative. The formation of spinel Li[LixMn2~x]O4 at elevated temperature is elucidated. 2. EXPERIMENTAL Synthesis of Li4Mn5O12. Pure (99.9%) LiOAc · 2H2O and Mn(NO3)2 · 6H2O (from WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were used as starting materials. Stoichiometric amounts of the raw materials were first heated at 100°C to obtain a uniform eutectic solution and then slowly oxidized at 200°C under flowing O2, thereby converting the eutectic solution to a solid Li—Mn—O precursor. Powder samples were obtained by heating the ground precursor at temperatures ranging from 400°C to 900°C for 1—3 days. All samples were heated at a rate of 100°C/hr and slowly cooled to room temperature in the furnace (about 7 hr) with 200 ml/min of flowing O2. Details of the preparation process are described in our previous report (6). Samples heated at 700°C for 1 day and 500°C for 2 days are designated as 700-1D and 500-2D, respectively. X-ray diffraction. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were conducted at room temperature on a Rigaku RAX-I X-ray diffractometer with CuKa radiation monochromated by a graphite single crystal at 40 kV, 30 mA. Data were collected between 2h"15°—120° with a step interval of 0.03. Neutron diffraction. Neutron-diffraction data were collected using the HB4 high-resolution powder diffractometer at the High-Flux Isotope Reactor equipped with a Ge (115) monochromator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The neutron wavelength was found to be 1.4180(2) A_ on the basis of unit cell refinements for a silicon standard. Each sample (4.5 g) was placed in a spinning vanadium can (1 cm i.d. by 6 cm) at 295 K, for data collection over the 2h range 11°—135° in steps of 0.05°. The structural refinements were carried out with the Rietveld refinement program RIETAN-94 (13) on a Power Macintosh 8100/100AV. The mean oxidation number of manganese (ZM/) in the sample was determined from the active oxygen content which was measured by the standard volumetric method (14) of KMnO4 titration. 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Structural Refinement of Li4Mn5O12 by the Rietveld Method Refinements were initiated in the space group Fd31 m using the initial structural model with atomic coordinates from our previous X-ray diffraction study of Li4Mn5O12. The following neutron scattering lengths were used: bL*" !0.1900]10~14 m, bM/"!0.3730]10~14m, bO" 0.5803]10~14 m. The simultaneous refinement was carried out on two crystalline phases: Li4Mn5O12 (space group Fd31 m, No. 227) and Li2MnO3 (C/2m, No. 12). The crystallographic parameters of Li2MnO3 were adopted from Strobel and Andron (15). Only the scale factor and cell parameters of Li2MnO3 were refined because of its small content ((5%). It was confirmed that the simultaneous refinement improves the ‘‘goodness of fit’’ indicator, S, and results in smaller R factors for both X-ray and neutron profiles. In addition, small diffraction peaks from Li2MnO3 as indicated by arrows in Fig. 1 appeared in both neutron and X-ray diffraction profiles. To obtain better consistency between the X-ray and neutron diffraction data, several constraints were imposed in the final refinements. The site occupancy of the octahedrally coordinated manganese ions in the 16d sites was finally refined based on the X-ray diffraction data because manganese is more sensitive to X-ray, while the occupancy of Li in the 8a sites and oxygen in the 32e sites and overall isotropic thermal parameters were determined using the neutron diffraction data. We could not perform the combined X-ray and neutron Rietveld refinement using RIETAN-94. By introducing the constraints to the refinement of X-ray and neutron diffraction profiles separately, and repeating the refinements step by step, we were able to match both the neutron and X-ray powder diffraction patterns with very similar structural parameters. The final observed, calculated, and difference profiles are shown in Fig. 1 and the refined lattice parameter, atomic coordinates, thermal parameters, and interatomic distances for Li4Mn5O12 (sample 700-1D) are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The site occupancies confirmed that the ion distribution is very close to the ideal arrangement, (Li)8a [Li1@3Mn5@3]16dO4 (16). The occupation of the interstitial 16c sites by Li and the 8a sites by Mn are ruled out. Allowing variation of the oxygen site occupancy results in a value of 1.0 within the standard deviation, which indicates that the oxygen is very nearly stoichiometric in this sample. STRUCTURE REFINEMENT OF Li4Mn5O12 75 FIG. 1. Rietveld refinement profiles for the Li4Mn5O12 sample prepared at 700°C. Observed (dots) and calculated (solid line) intensities are shown at the top, and the difference of the observed and calculated intensities (*I) are shown at the bottom. The tick marks below the pattern indicate the positions of all possible Bragg reflections from Li4Mn5O12 (upper) and Li2MnO3 (lower). R factors as defined in (12) are given for reference. Instead, the occupancy of manganese in the 16d sites, gM/, is found to be 0.84, with an estimated standard deviation (e.s.d.) of 0.02. The value of gM/ is a little higher than, but in good agreement with, the 0.833 value of the ideal arrangement (Li)8a[Li1@3Mn5@3]16dO4, in which 0.333 Li ions are required to compensate for the imbalance in charge in the 16d sites assuming all the manganese ions are in the 4# state. From the electroneutrality point of view, a higher value of gM/ indicates the presence of Mn3` ions.

Figure 2 and Table 3 show the Rietveld refinement plot and the structural parameters for the Li4Mn5O12 sample prepared at 500°C (500-2D). The diffraction peaks were broader than those of the 700-1D sample, therefore overlapping the reflections from the minor phase Li2MnO3. The amount of Li2MnO3 was found to be less than 2 wt%. The peak intensity of the sample 500-2D was much lower than that of the 700-1D sample, indicating the lower crystallinity of the spinel Li4Mn5O12.

This indicates about 0.7% contraction in volume of the unit cell from the sample prepared at 700°C. The refined site occupancy of manganese in the 16d sites, gM/, is 0.83$0.01 which is identical to 0.833 of the ideal arrangement, indicating that the oxidation state of manganese in this sample is very close to 4#. To better understand the changes in lattice parameter, the bond length of Li—O and Mn—O, and the oxygen parameter, u, with the synthesis temperature, analogous refinements of the X-ray diffraction data for all samples prepared at temperatures in the range 400 to 900°C were performed, and the results are plotted in Fig. 3. For simplicity, the Mn—O bond represents the bond between oxygen and the cations in octahedral sites (Mn and Li ions that occupy 16d sites). The oxygen parameter slightly increased with synthesis temperature from 0.3872(3) to 0.3886(3). These numbers are much larger than the ideal value for spinel structure, 0.375, which implies that Li—O tetrahedra are larger than the Mn—O octahedra. The change in the bond length of Mn—O with synthesis temperature is rather small, whereas the Li—O bond is likely to be more ionic than the Mn—O bond and thus expands more readily with temperature (16, 17). Refinement of the manganese site occupancy factor revealed that gM/ increased with synthesis temperature. The refined gM/ for spinel Li—Mn—O and the portion of precipitated Li2MnO3 in the final products are plotted in Fig. 4 STRUCTURE REFINEMENT OF Li4Mn5O12 77 FIG. 3. Changes in bond lengths Li—O and Mn—O and the oxygen parameter u with synthesis temperature, along with the lattice parameter for the spinel Li—Mn—O. against the synthesis temperature, along with the lattice parameter. As synthesis temperature was raised to 900°C, the site occupancy gM/ reached 1.0, which indicates a change in the composition of the spinel phase. Since no evidence for oxygen deficiency in the 32e sites was found in these refinements, the spinel phase should be stoichiometric with a composition, lying on the tie line between Li4Mn5O12 and LiMn2O4 in the Li—Mn—O diagram (2, 3), which can be simply expressed as Li1`xMn2~xO4 (1/34x40). In this case, the increase in gM/ from 0.83 to 1.0 corresponds to a composition transition of the spinel phase from Li4Mn5O12 to LiMn2O4, whereby the manganese oxidation state decreases from 4.0 to 3.5, and the molar ratio of Li/Mn in the spinel phase decreases from 0.8 to 0.5. The increase in the lattice parameter with synthesis temperature, therefore, can be easily ascribed to the presence of larger Mn3` ions in the samples prepared at elevated temperatures. The effective ion radii of octahedrally coordinated Mn3` and Mn4` are 0.645 (in high-spin state) and 0.56 As , respectively (18). The precipitation of Li2MnO3, thus, occurs to consume the excess Li. FIG. 4. Plot of the refined gM/, the portion of precipitated Li2MnO3 against the synthesis temperature, along with the lattice parameter of the spinel Li—Mn—O. The composition transition of the spinel from Li4Mn5O12 to LiMn2O4, thus, can be expressed as: Li4Mn5O12 ;700°C */ O2 &&&&&" aLi[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4 #b Li2MnO3#eO2C . [1] Based on Eq. [1] and the point of view of electroneutrality, we deduced that gM/"(5#3d)/6, the mean oxidation state of manganese in the final products consisted of a Li[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4#b Li2MnO3, ZM/"(40#42d)/ (10#15d), and the portion of Li2MnO3 (mol%)"9d/ (3d#2). To verify the reaction of Eq. [1], the mean oxidation number of manganese (ZM/) in the samples synthesized at temperatures between 400 and 900°C was determined from the active oxygen content which was measured using the standard volumetric method of KMnO4 titration. The measured ZM/, refined gM/, and the weight portion of Li2MnO3 (wt%) for these samples are plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of d in Li[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4, along with their calculated values based on the relations mentioned above. 78 TAKADA ET AL. FIG. 5. Measured (marks) and calculated (lines) values of the mean valence of manganese, ZM/, refined site occupation factor of manganese in the 16d sites, gM/, and the portion of precipitated Li2MnO3, Li2MnO3 wt%, against d in the spinel Li[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4 for samples prepared at a temperature between 400 and 900°C. Despite the insufficiency of the experimental data, good consistency is obtained in the trend of the changes of gM/, Li2MnO3 (wt%), and ZM/ with d in Li[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4. Consequently, the composition of the spinel phase changes as the synthesis temperature is raised above 700°C, and it proceeds along the reaction of Eq. [1]. The value of d in Li[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4 changes from 0 to 1/3 when the synthesis temperature varies from 400 to 900°C. It is worth noting that the whole heating/cooling process for these samples proceeded rather slowly with 200 ml/min flow of pure O2. The atmosphere has a significant effect on the final products; a complete decomposition of Li4Mn5O12 to LiMn2O4 #Li2MnO3 occurs at 580°C in nitrogen (7) but at temperatures above 900°C in oxygen. For verification, the data of ZM/, gM/, and Li2MnO3 (wt%) for Li4Mn5O12 reheated at 580°C in nitrogen were also plotted in Fig. 5; these data points correspond to d"0.32, which indicates a full decomposition of Li4Mn5O12 to 2LiMn2O4#Li2MnO3. Further verification of the formation of the pure phase spinel Li[Li1@3~dMn5@3`d]O4, or Li[LixMn2~x]O4 (x" 1/3!d), is currently being done by varying the molar ratio Li/Mn in the starting materials. A good consistency in the ZM/, the gM/, and the ratio Li/Mn in the final products is obtained. Details of the crystal structure and the thermal stability of the spinel Li[LixMn2~x]O4 will be described separately. 4. CONCLUSION Well-crystallized Li4Mn5O12 has been prepared from the eutectic of LiOAc and Mn(NO3)2 under flowing oxygen. Rietveld refinement of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data indicated that Li4Mn5O12 possesses a cubic spinel structure in which lithium ions occupy both the tetrahedral sites 8a and part of the octahedral sites 16d, but not the 16c sites, while all the manganese ions occupy the 16d sites of the space group Fd31 m. The lattice parameter was found to be sensitive to synthesis temperature as a result of the variation in manganese valence. The formation of the spinel Li[LixMn2~x]O4, in which x decreased from 1/3 to 0 as the synthesis temperature increased from 700 to 900°C, owing to the transition from Mn4` to Mn3` of a portion of the manganese ions, is elucidated with the concomitant formation of the minor phase Li2MnO3.
